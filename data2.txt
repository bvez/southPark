Stan,"You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 
"
Kyle,"Going away? For how long?
"
Stan,"Forever.
"
Chef,"I'm sorry boys.
"
Stan,"Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 
"
Chef,"Wow!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!
"
Chef,"What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"I hope you're making the right choice.
"
Cartman,"I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 
"
Stan,"Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 
"
Mayor McDaniels,"And we will all miss you, Chef,  but we know you must do what your heart tells you..
"
Jimbo,"Bye-bye!
"
Gerald,"Good-bye!
"
Mr. Mackey,"So long!
"
A Man,"So long, Chef!
"
A Sign-Holder,"Good-bye, Chef!
"
Randy,"Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!
"
Chef,"Good-bye! ..
"
Kyle,"Draw two card, fatass.
"
Cartman,"Reverse to you, Jew. 
"
Stan,"I'll get it. 
"
Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
Stan,"He's back!
"
Kyle,"Yeah!
"
Cartman,"All right! 
"
Kyle,"Chef! I can't believe you're back!
"
Chef,"Well, it's true.
"
Stan,"But are you back for good?
"
Chef,"That's right.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Hey everybody! Chef's back!
"
Patrons,"What? All right! Yeah! 
"
Randy,"Oh, finally! 
"
Gerald,"Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people.
"
Chef,"Yeah!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"But now that you're back here, does that mean that you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore?
"
Chef,"Nnono!
"
Randy,"Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
"
Chef,"That's right.
"
Randy,"Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?
"
Chef,"That's right. Randy! 
"
Jimbo,"Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house.
"
Chef,"Thank you. Jimbo.
"
Randy,"Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
"
Chef,"That's right! Thank you. Good-bye- Everybody.
"
Townsfolk,"Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye
"
Kyle,"Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
"
Chef,"You bet! Good-bye. Children! 
"
Stan,"Right. Uh, see ya.
"
Cartman,"Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
"
Stan,"Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
"
Stan,"Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, me too.)
"
A Boy,"It's really weird what he said. I don't know, it kind of confused me.
"
Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
"
Clyde,"You guys, you guys.
"
Stan,"What?
"
Clyde,"Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
"
Kyle,"Like what?
"
Clyde,"I think...  I think he wants to have sex with me.
"
Stan,"What??
"
Clyde,"I gotta- I gotta go. 
"
Kyle,"Weirdo. 
"
Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
The Boys,"Hey Chef.
"
Chef,"How's it goin'?
"
Kyle,"Good.
"
Chef,"Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?
"
Cartman,"Excuse me?
"
Chef,"Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love.
"
Kyle,"...Chef?? A-are you okay?
"
Chef,"I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle.
"
Stan,"Dude, what are you saying??
"
Chef,"I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children.
"
Stan,"...WHAT??
"
Det. Jarvis,"Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef.
"
Kyle,"This doesn't make any sense!
"
Det. Jarvis,"We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.
"
Stan,"No, he's not.
"
Det. Jarvis,"Uh huh.
"
Stan,"No, he's not.
"
Det. Jarvis,"Yeah, yeah he is so.
"
Butters,"What's a pedophile?
"
Det. Jarvis,"Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef,  so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here? 
"
Stan,"NO!
"
Det. Jarvis,"Okay, did he touch you here? 
"
The Class,"NO!
"
Det. Jarvis,"Did he ever do this? How about this? 
"
Butters,"My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
"
Det. Jarvis,"Did Chef ever try one of these on for size? 
"
Kyle,"Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
"
Det. Jarvis,"Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh.
"
Chef,"Hello there, children!
"
Kyle,"Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
"
Chef,"Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love.
"
Stan,"No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
"
Chef,"Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass
"
Kyle,"Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
"
Chef,"I specializes in your asshole, Kyle. 
"
Cartman,"...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
"
Kyle,"He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
"
Kenny,"(Like what?)
"
Kyle,"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
"
Stan,"Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah! I think...)
"
Cartman,"Yeah!
"
Kyle,"All right, come on guys!
"
Cartman,"Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. 
"
Butler,"May I help you.
"
Kyle,"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
"
Butler,"Right this way. 
"
Head Adventurer,"Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-
"
Butler,"Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you.
"
Head Adventurer,"Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!
"
Club Members,"Tally ho!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Indeed!
"
Kyle,"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 
"
Mr. Connolly,"What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!
"
Cartman,"...Huh?
"
Marksman,"We travel the world and have sex with children!
"
Marine,"Yes, what else would we do?
"
Kyle,"Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club!  Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit.
"
Kyle,"...Dude!
"
Mr. Connolly,"I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!
"
Stan,"NO!!
"
Mr. Connolly,"No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again?  How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club? 
"
Stan,"No! 
"
Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody.  Well, so long then.
"
Kyle,"Just what the hell is that thing?!
"
Mr. Connolly,"What? What thing? I don't see anything.
"
Kyle,"HA! I knew it!
"
Stan,"Knew what?
"
Kyle,"The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
"
Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch!
"
Chef,"Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love.
"
Stan,"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
"
Chef,"I just like to make love up your butt.
"
Woman,"Oh my God!
"
Nurse,"Mr. Chef, is it?
"
Kyle,"All right, come on. 
"
Dr. Neeland,"Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?
"
Kyle,"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
"
Dr. Neeland,"Brainwashed.
"
Stan,"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
"
Dr. Neeland,"I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.
"
Stan,"No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
"
Dr. Neeland,"Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah.
"
Chef,"Doctor, do you have- children?
"
Dr. Neeland,"Why, yes, I have two young boys.
"
Chef,"Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
"
Dr. Neeland,"You say he's never been like this before?
"
Cartman,"No, Chef has always been super-cool.
"
Chef,"I'm gonna make love to the children.
"
Dr. Neeland,"He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.
"
Cartman,"So what can we do??
"
Dr. Neeland,"I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process.
"
Kyle,"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
"
Dr. Neeland,"Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?
"
Stan,"Having sex with women.
"
Dr. Neeland,"Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away.
"
DJ,"All right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!
"
Chef,"Aw, come on, children. Let's go home.
"
Stan,"This isn't working.
"
Dr. Neeland,"Well let's... give it some more time, kids. 
"
Stripper,"Would you like to daaance???
"
Kyle,"No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
"
Stripper,"Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???
"
Cartman,"Come on, bitch! Dance!
"
Blonde,"Up yours, fatty.
"
Cartman,"Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
"
DJ,"All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spontaneous Bootay! 
"
Stan,"Come on guys, we might as well go. 
"
Chef,"God-damn!
"
Stan,"Chef, we're leaving.
"
Dr. Neeland,"Nono, wait. Let him go. 
"
Spontaneous Bootay,"Come here, chubby. 
"
Chef,"Wait a minute.
"
Stan,"He's remembering.
"
Chef,"Children! What have I done?
"
Cartman,"It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!
"
Chef,"I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
"
Kyle,"Come on, Chef! You can do it!
"
Chef,"I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!
"
The Boys,"Yay!
"
Kenny,"(Chef!)
"
Chef,"Hey children, everybody! I'm back!  Ow.
"
Mr. Connolly,"Great shot, William! Hit him with another. 
"
Chef,"Oh! 
"
The Boys,"Chef!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Tally ho, lads! I must say you're starting to become quite a thorn in my balls.
"
Stan,"Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
"
Mr. Connolly,"He's safe.  He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.
"
Cartman,"Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
"
Mr. Connolly,"We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!
"
Stan,"Oh Jesus, here we go.
"
Mr. Connolly,"Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.
"
Stan,"We don't wanna hear it.
"
Mr. Connolly,"You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas!  Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers,  but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it.  Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.
"
Stan,"Immortal.
"
Mr. Connolly,"He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies.  And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos.  Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892. 
"
Kyle,"...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
"
Mr. Connolly,"Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?
"
Stan,"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.
"
Mr. Connolly,"Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave. 
"
Stan,"We're not leaving without Chef.
"
Mr. Connolly,"If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave.  You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see!  Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?
"
Kyle,"We're not going anywhere without Chef.
"
Mr. Connolly,"Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome.  You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security!  Take these boys to the door.
"
Guard 1,"All right, come on kids.
"
Kyle,"No! Hey!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Haha! Look they're being led out by security! Haha!
"
Stan,"No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
"
Guard 2,"This is their house and they don't want you here. 
"
Kyle,"Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
"
William,"And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills. 
"
Kyle,"Chef, come on!
"
Chef,"Children!
"
William,"Get out of here!
"
Cartman,"Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
"
Kenny,"(Yeeeeehah!) 
"
Stan,"Come on, Chef!
"
Chef,"I can't... break these locks. 
"
Kyle,"Here! 
"
Cartman,"Run Chef!
"
Mr. Connolly,"What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!
"
Kyle,"Get outside! 
"
Mr. Connolly,"Stop them! 
"
Chef,"Children! Run! 
"
Mr. Connolly,"Stop! 
"
Stan,"We made it!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place?? 
"
Stan,"Chef, come on!
"
Mr. Connolly,"You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!
"
Kyle,"Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?
"
Mr. Connolly,"Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!
"
Stan,"Chef, we love you.
"
Chef,"I'm sorry children. 
"
Kyle,"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
"
Chef,"Get the hell out of here, children!!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all.  NO! 
"
The Boys,"Chef! 
"
Chef,"Ack.  Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit!  Ah- Awww! 
"
Stan,"NO! 
"
Cartman,"A mountain lion! 
"
Mr. Connolly,"We can't lose another member! Shoot it! 
"
Chef,"Ah!
"
Marksman,"All right, this! 
"
Kyle,"CHEF! 
"
Cartman,"A grizzly bear!
"
Stan,"Oh my God... They killed Chef.
"
Kyle,"You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester. 
"
Cartman,"Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
"
Chef,"POOOT! 
"
Cartman,"Oh never mind.
"
Stan,"Come on, let's go. 
"
Kyle,"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
"
Randy,"Yeah.
"
Mr. Mackey,"He's right. 
"
Kyle,"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 
"
Mr. Connolly,"Is it working? Is it working?
"
Tech,"Yes. We've got a pulse!
"
Mr. Connolly,"Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry!  We have done it! Good! Raise him up!  Chef, can you hear me? Say something.
"
Darth Chef,"Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury steak?
"
Mr. Connolly,"Yes, go on.
"
Darth Chef,"And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?
"
Mr. Connolly,"Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy?
"
Darth Chef,"No, I mean my balls.
"
Mr. Connolly,"Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!
"
Gerald,"Hey there, Richard!
"
Richard,"Oh, hey Gerald. New car?
"
Gerald,"Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and-  be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
"
Richard,"Well... Good for you.
"
Gerald,"Oho...  Thanks. 
"
Stephen,"Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else.
"
Gerald,"You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment.  Thanks.
"
Kyle,"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 
"
Driver,"Hey, is that a hybrid?
"
Gerald,"Oh yes. You've got one too, I see.
"
Driver,"Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway,  good for you!
"
Gerald,"Thanks.
"
Kyle,"Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 
"
Gerald,"Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot.
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Gerald,"Okay, there's another one.  Aw, man! Look at that!  Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick!  ""Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler""
"
Kyle,"Dad, can we go home, please?
"
Gerald,"Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"But Dad, I want-
"
Gerald,"NOW, KYLE! 
"
Stan,"Oh hey Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
"
Stan,"Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
"
Kyle,"Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 
"
Randy,"What's this? 
"
Gerald,"Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
"
Randy,"A ticket? ""Failure to care about the environment"" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
"
Gerald,"Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-
"
Randy,"You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
"
Gerald,"Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket.
"
Randy,"I know it's not a real ticket!!
"
Jimbo,"Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! 
"
Gerald,"Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon.
"
Jimbo,"Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!
"
Kyle,"Dad, let's just go!
"
Gerald,"Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem.
"
Randy,"The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
"
Gerald,"Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was ""high and mighty"" to  care about the earth!
"
Randy,"And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
"
Gerald,"Well, I really don't see how  that has anything to do with the-
"
Randy,"There, like that! Stop that!
"
Darryl,"Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck!
"
Gerald,"All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! 
"
Gerald,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away.
"
Kyle,"Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
"
Gerald,"Yes, it certainly is.
"
Kyle,"We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
"
Ike,"Take offense.
"
Kyle,"...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 
"
Ike,"Alienated.
"
Kyle,"...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
"
Gerald,"Well, I totally agree, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"You do??
"
Gerald,"Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
"
Kyle,"Righ!  Okay, good.
"
Gerald,"And that's why,  I've talked it over with your mother, and  ...we've decided to MOVE!
"
Kyle,"What??
"
Gerald,"We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! 
"
Stan,"Yeah? 
"
Butters,"Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
"
Stan,"Going away party? What do you mean?
"
Butters,"Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
"
Stan,"Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
"
Butters,"Well he is.
"
Stan,"Where's the going-away party?
"
Butters,"At Cartman's house.
"
Cartman,"Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 
"
Token,"Hey Eric, where's Kyle?
"
Cartman,"Who? 
"
Clyde,"Kyle, the person leaving.
"
Cartman,"Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
"
Craig,"Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!
"
Stan,"Kyle? Kyle!
"
Clyde,"Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.
"
Stan,"What?!
"
Cartman,"You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
"
Stan,"Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
"
Kyle,"My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
"
Stan,"Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.
"
Gerald,"I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.
"
Stan,"Well... Maybe they'll change.
"
Gerald,"I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! 
"
Stan,"Nooo!
"
Gerald,"Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.  Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day,  we're just gonna have to be  with our own kind. 
"
Stan,"I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
"
Gerald,"Well? What do you think, huh? 
"
Sheila,"Oh Gerald, it's beautiful.
"
Gerald,"Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. 
"
Man,"Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors.
"
Gerald,"Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.
"
Man,"Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis  So how do you like the neighborhood?
"
Sheila,"Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
"
Peter,"Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to  keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down.
"
Man 2,"You in here, Peter?
"
Peter,"Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis
"
Paul,"Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan
"
Gerald and Sheila,"Hello.
"
Paul,"We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?
"
Gerald,"Yeah. That's right.
"
Peter,"Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series  Its emissions are actually cleaner.
"
Gerald,"Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?
"
Peter,"Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco.  Ahhhm.  Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here.
"
Paul,"Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest.  Ahhh,  ahh,  ahh.  We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco
"
Gerald,"Yeah. We sure are.
"
Stan,"Come on, people. Come on, people now. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing?
"
Stan,"I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
"
Cartman,"THAT's gay, heh.
"
Stan,"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
"
Cartman,"Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
"
Stan,"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
"
Cartman,"Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 
"
Butters,"Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. 
"
Stan,"Come on, people. Come on, people now.
"
DJ,"All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with ""Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already"". 
"
Stan,"Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
"
Customer,"He's right. 
"
Stan,"We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
"
Jimbo,"Yeah, I just wanted to  try to set an example, you know?
"
Jimbo,"Thanks. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? 
"
Randy,"I know! It's like ""Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl""
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?
"
Driver 1,"Good for you!
"
Driver 2,"Thanks!
"
Randy,"At least we're smart enough to know better!
"
Driver 3,"Thanks! 
"
Stan,"Come on, everybody be people now
"
Speaker,"And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country! 
"
Richard,"If only the rest of the country  was as insightful as we are.
"
Stan,"Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 
"
Jimbo,"Great speech!
"
Gerald,"Yeah, well, you know my son is just  a little bit more clever than some.
"
An officer,"Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song.
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Uhh! 
"
Stan,"Ow!
"
Ranger McFriendly,"You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!
"
Stan,"What?!
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Come with me! 
"
Ranger McFriendly,"There! Look! 
"
Stan,"Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!
"
Stan,"Smug?
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!
"
Announcer,"This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!
"
Anchor Tom,"It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?
"
Keenan,"Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning.  All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country.
"
Singer,"A smuggy day in San Francisco town.
"
Paul,"Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?
"
Sheila,"No! Hello, how are you?
"
Gail,"Really good, really good. 
"
Gerald,"Hey there. Alan, right?
"
Alan,"Actually, it's Alain
"
Gerald,"Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?
"
Alan,"Can I just get an empty glass?
"
Gerald,"Oh. Sure. 
"
Alan,"Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death. 
"
Kyle,"So... what do you do for fun?
"
Brian,"We drink and take drugs.
"
Boy 1,"Do you want some acid?
"
Kyle,"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
"
Boy 2,"You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.
"
Brian,"It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.
"
Gerald,"Everything okay in here, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, fine, Dad.
"
Gerald,"So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys?  Wuhh  Mmmm.
"
Kyle,"Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
"
Ike,"I want three.
"
Stan,"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
"
Cartman,"Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
"
Butters,"Yeah. You're right. 
"
Cartman,"You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
"
Butters,"Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
"
Cartman,"No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Marsh!
"
Stan,"Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.
"
Cartman,"Who?
"
Ranger McFriendly,"You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!
"
Keenan,"I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here.  This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength.
"
Cartman,"The smug?
"
Keenan,"The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here.  These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other.  Now take a look at this. 
"
Stan,"What is that?
"
Keenan,"It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.
"
Stan,"George Clooney's acceptance speech?
"
Keenan,"Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction.
"
Ranger McFriendly,"We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!
"
Stan,"What about San Francisco?
"
Keenan,"Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco.
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Soo, that's it people.  When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen.
"
Randy,"Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
"
Ranger McFriendly,"If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. 
"
Jimbo,"This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
"
Randy,"Yeah. Good going, stupid!
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town.
"
Stephen,"Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! 
"
Jimbo,"Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! 
"
Randy,"Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!
"
Stan,"I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
"
Randy,"Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
"
Ranger McFriendly,"How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?
"
Keenan,"Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.
"
Attendant,"The hell is that? 
"
Butters,"Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
"
Cartman,"I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
"
Butters,"But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
"
Cartman,"You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
"
Butters,"I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
"
Cartman,"I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 
"
Ranger McFriendly,"All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!
"
Stan,"Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?!  Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!
"
Keenan,"They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!
"
Man,"Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.
"
Cartman,"Butters, are you there?!
"
Butters,"I'm here, Eric.
"
Cartman,"I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
"
Butters,"You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
"
Cartman,"Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
"
Butters,"Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
"
Cartman,"Turning right at O two four niner. 
"
Randy,"That's it. That's that the last one.
"
Ranger McFriendly,"Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!
"
Keenan,"Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside!  God help us.
"
Cartman,"Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
"
Butters,"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
"
Cartman,"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
"
Gerald,"Being smug is a good thing. 
"
Cartman,"Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!
"
Kyle,"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.
"
Ike,"I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.
"
Cartman,"We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! 
"
Network Anchor,"And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.
"
Stan,"No...
"
Randy,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
"
Clyde,"Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Clyde,"It's a miracle!
"
Stan,"Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Hey Stan.
"
Stan,"Dude, what happened?? 
"
Gerald,"We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
"
Mr. Mackey,"It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? 
"
Stan,"Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.
"
Richard,"So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
"
Randy,"Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
"
Gerald,"And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? 
"
Kyle,"NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
"
Mr. Mackey,"But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?
"
Kyle,"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
"
Randy,"You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
"
Kyle,"Yeah!
"
Randy,"I'm...  I'm not ready...
"
Gerald,"I don't think I can do it either.
"
Mr. Mackey,"It's simply asking too much.
"
Randy,"Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
"
Gerald,"Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! 
"
Cartman,"Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, I guess so.
"
Cartman,"We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
"
Kyle,"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! 
"
Cartman,"Ah, that's better. 
"
Sharon,"But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever.  Goodnight my little angel. 
"
Randy,"STAAAN!!
"
Stan,"What?? What??
"
Randy,"Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!
"
Shelly,"Whats going on dad?
"
Randy,"JUST GET THE GUN!! 
"
Randy,"Unh, come on! 
"
Man,"AWWWGH!
"
Woman,"Oh nooo! 
"
Stan,"Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
"
Kyle,"I have no idea!
"
Man,"Take cover in the community center again!
"
Jimbo,"All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!
"
Linda,"Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters. 
"
Stephen,"We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!
"
Stan,"Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 
"
Randy,"A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 
"
Stan,"Sso?
"
Randy,"SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
"
Gerald,"Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
"
Randy,"Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
"
Crowd,"AWWW!
"
Jimbo,"How could Family Guy do that?
"
Sheila,"Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
"
Randy,"Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
"
Stan,"Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
"
Mr. Mackey,"Wu-we've got the TV working! 
"
Tom,"Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on Family Guy!
"
Sharon,"Oh Randy, hold me. 
"
Tom,"The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world.  All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and Family Guy posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement:
"
al-Zawahri,"We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation!
"
Linda,"So what happens now?
"
Randy,"We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"It's okay! 
"
Randy,"We're alive?? We're alive! 
"
Jimbo,"Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute.
"
Crowd,"Oh thank God.
"
Randy,"Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
"
Stan,"They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
"
Kyle,"I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
"
Kyle,"Okay you guys, check it out. 
"
Cartman,"You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
"
Kyle,"Dude, it's a good show.
"
Stan,"Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.
"
Cartman,"Yich. 
"
Lois,"Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner.
"
Peter,"You think that's bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car? 
"
Peter,"Hey there, Knight Rider. 
"
Michael,"After those bad guys, KITT! 
"
Chris,"Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?
"
Stewie,"Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.
"
Peter,"Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain? 
"
Peter,"Pancakes for you, Captain?
"
Soccer Captain,"I'll be the Captain, and you'll be Tenille. 
"
Peter,"Love will keep us together
"
Kyle,"Hehaha, heh.
"
Cartman,"Yich.
"
Lois,"But Peter, I don't wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend.
"
Peter,"Well, maybe we can just have tea.
"
Brian,"You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith? 
"
Peter,"Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea. 
"
Mr. T,"Try my ""Mr. T. ...tea."" 
"
Peter,"Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh.
"
Kyle,"That's it? That's all they did?
"
Cartman,"Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
"
Stan,"What? What's the big deal?
"
Cartman,"What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
"
Kyle,"Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
"
Stan,"Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
"
Cartman,"That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
"
Kyle,"Uhhh...
"
Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! 
"
Sheila,"Kyle? Kyle, what are you watchi-?!
"
Peter,"Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake.
"
Sheila,"Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! 
"
Kyle,"Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!
"
Gerald,"It's okay... it's dead.
"
Sheila,"You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
"
Kyle,"Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
"
Sheila,"You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad.
"
Kyle,"No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Kyle, you're not being very sensitive.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Let's all look at why Muslims are upset:  First of all, in the Muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what?  Sex. Good.  There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world.  Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody?  Jack off.  Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion.  And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in?  Good, sand.  Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too!
"
Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
"
Wendy,"...yeah.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!
"
Stan,"The hell's going on now?!
"
Principal Victoria,"Shh! Quiet, students, quiet!
"
SNN Anchor,"Once again: we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored!
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Why would they-?
"
SNN Anchor,"FOX Studios claims that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view.  The head of FOX had this to say:
"
FOX President,"Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't.
"
Randy,"FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
"
SNN Anchor,"Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat
"
al-Zawahri,"Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?
"
Cartman,"Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
"
Stan,"Does this mean we don't have school all week?
"
Cartman,"You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
"
Kenny,"(Like what?)
"
Cartman,"We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
"
Stan,"Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
"
Cartman,"Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
"
Stan,"To Los Angeles?
"
Cartman,"If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
"
Kyle,"Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
"
Cartman,"Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
"
Cartman,"All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny?  What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle?  I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. 
"
Gerald,"Kyle! Kyle, wake up!  We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!
"
Kyle,"Dad? Are you sure there's time?
"
Gerald,"This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!
"
Kyle,"No!
"
Sheila,"Wait a minute!  Where's Ike?!
"
Gerald,"He was just here! Ike!
"
Sheila,"Ike! 
"
Kyle,"Ike? Iiike!  Ike! 
"
Ike,"Ice cream. I want chocolate.
"
Kyle,"Ike!  This way!  Iiike! 
"
Ike,"Kyyyle!
"
Kyle,"Nooooo! 
"
Cartman,"Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 
"
Kyle,"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
"
Cartman,"Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this.  Especially one who doesn't trust me. 
"
Kyle,"Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
"
Cartman,"Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
"
Kyle,"It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
"
Cartman,"You know we might not even make it into the studio.
"
Kyle,"I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
"
Cartman,"So what made you change your mind?
"
Kyle,"I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
"
Cartman,"Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
"
Kyle,"Yeah! 
"
Cartman,"Are you set?
"
Kyle,"I'm set! Let's do this!
"
Cartman,"All right, let's roll! 
"
Mayor McDaniels,"People! People, quiet, please!  We must not panic!
"
Randy,"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
"
Prof. Thomas,"Thank you, Mayor.  Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it.
"
Jimbo,"So how do we do that?
"
Prof. Thomas,"We bury our heads. In sand.  We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all.
"
Stephen,"No, no, wait a minute,  that's ridiculous.  What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see?  If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. 
"
Randy,"I like the sand idea.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, me too.
"
Gerald,"Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. 
"
Mayor McDaniels,"We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!
"
Kyle,"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
"
Cartman,"Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
"
Kyle,"Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
"
Cartman,"It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
"
Kyle,"Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
"
Cartman,"Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
"
Kyle,"But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
"
Cartman,"Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
"
Kyle,"You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
"
Cartman,"Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
"
Kyle,"What are you talking about?!
"
Cartman,"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
"
Kyle,"I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
"
Cartman,"Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 
"
Kyle,"No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
"
Cartman,"Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
"
Kyle,"What?  CARTMAN! 
"
Cartman,"Kyle, stop it!
"
Cartman,"Holy Crap! 
"
Kyle,"Ahhh!
"
Trooper,"Stay on 'em!  Jesus, Mary! 
"
Prof. Thomas,"If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own. 
"
Stan,"Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
"
Randy,"It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Randy,"All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.
"
Stan,"Dad, this is stupid.
"
Randy,"Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 
"
Jimbo,"Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?
"
Prof. Thomas,"Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand.
"
Farmer,"I'll do it.
"
Wife,"Dylan, no!
"
Prof. Thomas,"You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience.
"
Dylan,"Yes, I know.
"
Wife,"Dylan, please, you can't!
"
Dylan,"Somebody has to do it, Sarah.  You run along now and you get your head in the sand. I'll be all right.  You have to understand... I'm all she has. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Who are those people?
"
Kyle,"No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! 
"
Cartman,"Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
"
Cartman,"Suck mah balls, Kyle! 
"
President Bush,"Are you the network president?
"
FOX President,"Yes, Mr. President.
"
President Bush,"We need to discuss this Family Guy episode, Mr. President.
"
FOX President,"Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad.
"
President Bush,"But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with.
"
FOX President,"Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. 
"
Announcer,"Next week on South Park: The race continues. Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff.
"
Cartman,"This... explains everything.
"
Announcer,"As an entire nation buries its head in sand... 
"
SNN Anchor,"The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone?
"
Announcer,"...and the battle between Good and Evil is finally waged...
"
Cartman,"Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!
"
Announcer,"Will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored? Will Family Guy be destroyed??? Will television executives fight for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out? Tune in to see Part 2 of Family Guy, next week, on South Park!
"
Announcer,"Previously on South Park...
"
SNN Anchor,"The popular cartoon, Family Guy, is going to show the image of Mohammad uncensored!
"
Prof. Thomas,"If we all bury our heads in sand,  we can avoid being any part of this.
"
Cartman,"I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
"
Kyle,"You just want Family Guy off the air...
"
Cartman,"Kyle, stop it!
"
Cartman,"So long, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
"
FOX President,"Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. 
"
Announcer,"And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Cartoon Wars... will not be seen tonight!  so that we can bring you this Terrance & Phillip Television Special 
"
Phillip,"Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy ""J"" Ranch?
"
Terrance,"It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. 
"
Phillip,"Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? 
"
Mohammad,"Hey guys, how's it going?
"
Terrance,"Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran.
"
Mohammad,"I'm here to investigate a murder.
"
Terrance,"ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!
"
Phillip,"You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!
"
Network President,"Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous.
"
Terrance,"But you ruined the whole show!
"
Network President,"Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys?  Aw, come on guys, give me a break.
"
Phillip,"We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy ""J"" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!
"
Network President,"Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad!
"
Terrance,"But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!
"
Network President,"I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled.
"
Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
"
Receptionist,"What is it regarding?
"
Cartman,"It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
"
Receptionist,"O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line.  That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, can I go before you?
"
Bart,"Eat my shorts!
"
Kyle,"What the hell is going on?  Hello?  Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles.  Hello?! 
"
SNN Anchor,"...starting in a small town in central Colorado. The idea has now spread all over America.  Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East, demanding that Family Guy not air tonight's episode.  Amd Muslim terrorists continue to make threats.
"
Al-Zawahri,"""Family Guy"" better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. ""Family Guy"" isn't funny.
"
SNN Anchor,"Osama bin Laden had this to say:
"
Osama bin Laden,"If you look closely at the writing in ""Family Guy"", you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and I think that's totally gay.
"
SNN Anchor,"Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate. 
"
Trucker,"You one of them?
"
Kyle,"Who?
"
Trucker,"How come your head ain't in the sand? 
"
Cartman,"So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
"
Bart,"I hate Family Guy.
"
Cartman,"So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
"
Bart,"Not nicely.
"
Cartman,"Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
"
Bart,"Cool, man.
"
Cartman,"Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
"
Bart,"Isn't that like, terrorism?
"
Cartman,"...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
"
Bart,"I could do that.
"
Cartman,"This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
"
Bart,"I'm a pretty bad kid.
"
Cartman,"Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
"
Bart,"I stole the head off a statue once.
"
Cartman,"Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
"
Bart,"You got it, man. You got it. 
"
Cartman,"Seeya.
"
President Bush,"I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven.
"
Reporters,"Mr. President!
"
Reporter 1,"Mr. President, can't the writers of the show be reasoned with? Don't they know they're putting the country in danger? 
"
President Bush,"I have come to... understand something about the Family Guy writing staff. Suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence.
"
Reporters,"Mr. President!
"
Reporter 1,"What exactly did you learn about the Family Guy writing staff, Mr. President?
"
President Bush,"I'm afraid that information is classified.
"
Reporters,"AWWW!!!  Mr. President!
"
TCO Reporter,"Mr. President, can't you force the Family Guy writing staff not to write anything about Mohammad? 
"
LSX Reporter,"Couldn't you throw them in prison? 
"
President Bush,"Look! The fact of the matter is the Family Guy writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!
"
Reporter 2,"And what exactly is this First Amendment, Mr. President?
"
President Bush,"Uh you know, the right to free speech.
"
Reporters,"AWWW!!! 
"
Reporter 3,"Mr. President, when your administration came up with this ""First Amendment,"" did it not foresee a problem like this might happen? 
"
President Bush,"Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place.
"
TCO Reporter,"What do you intend to do about this ""First Amendment,"" Mr. President? 
"
Reporter 4,"Forgive me, Mr. President, but this ""First Amendment"" sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob? 
"
Reporters,"Yeah!
"
Reporter 5,"That's right!
"
FOX President,"Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup.
"
Receptionist 2,"Sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the Family Guy episode
"
FOX President,"All right, let's get this over with. 
"
Cartman,"Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
"
Staff,"Oh, poor kid.
"
Cartman,"You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..
"
FOX President,"I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
"
Staffer,"Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy writing staff will refuse to work again.
"
FOX President,"Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode.
"
Cartman,"I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.
"
FOX President,"Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all.
"
Cartman,"Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
"
FOX President,"What was that?
"
Cartman,"I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening. 
"
Kyle,"Thanks a lot for the ride.
"
Trucker,"Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see Family Guy go off the air. I love that show!
"
Kyle,"I'll do everything I can.
"
Trucker,"I mean, I know it's just joke after joke, but I like that. At least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know? 
"
Kyle,"Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?
"
Bart,"Who wants to know?!
"
Kyle,"Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
"
Bart,"The network president's office is in there! 
"
Kyle,"Oh thanks, dude.
"
Bart,"No problem, man. 
"
Kyle,"Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!
"
Bart,"Cowabunga, motherfucker!
"
Receptionist 2,"Hello Mitchell.
"
Mitchell,"Oh hi, Miss Travis.
"
Miss Travis,"The president has asked that little Danny Pocket here speak with the Family Guy writing staff.
"
Mitchell,"Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.
"
Cartman,"It won't take long, sir.  Ow...
"
Mitchell,"All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny.  You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff.
"
Cartman,"Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
"
Mitchell,"Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff.
"
Cartman,"Wha?  What are they?
"
Mitchell,"They're manatees.  Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea.
"
Cartman,"Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.
"
Mitchell,"They really are brilliant creatures.  You see, the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls.  Each ball has a verb, noun, or pop culture reference written on it. There's millions of them.  The manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank.  Uh there goes Gretchen! She's comin' up with an idea. Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman.  The idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script.  Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect Family Guy joke! I can see it now!
"
Lois,"Peter, you didn't do the laundry today.
"
Peter,"You think that's bad? Remember the time I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?
"
Waiter,"¿Qué pasa, señores?
"
Gary Coleman,"Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?
"
Cartman,"Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
"
Mitchell,"When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you.  Keith?  All right all right, put it back in!  Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees.
"
Cartman,"Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
"
Mitchell,"That isn't gonna work on them.
"
Cartman,"Why not?
"
Mitchell,"Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.
"
Cartman,"Son of a bitch.
"
Kyle,"Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
"
Cartman,"Well well well! 
"
Kyle,"Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
"
Kyle,"You fat sun of a bitch!
"
Cartman,"You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
"
Bart,"Yeah.
"
Kyle,"Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
"
Bart,"Shut up!  You shut your fucking face, man!  Did it work? Did you scare the network into pulling the episode?
"
Cartman,"Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
"
Bart,"Cool man!
"
Kyle,"Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
"
Cartman,"Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle,  I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank.
"
Kyle,"WHAT?!
"
FOX President,"I don't understand it. What's wrong with them? 
"
Mitchell,"We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working.
"
FOX President,"But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?
"
Mitchell,"No sir, none of us did. 
"
FOX President,"Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
"
Cartman,"Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
"
FOX President,"You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!!  How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!
"
Executive,"Twenty-five minutes.
"
FOX President,"I gotta hurry! 
"
Cartman,"I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!
"
Cartman,"Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!
"
Kyle,"Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!
"
Cartman,"How the hell did you get out?
"
Kyle,"That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
"
Cartman,"Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
"
Kyle,"You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!
"
Cartman,"You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
"
Kyle,"There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! 
"
Cartman,"I can't let you do that!
"
Kyle,"Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
"
Cartman,"Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
"
Kyle,"Ow. Quit it!
"
Cartman,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! 
"
Cartman,"Stop it!
"
Kyle,"Ow. Quit it!
"
Cartman,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
"
Kyle,"No more timeouts, fatass!
"
Cartman,"Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!
"
Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. 
"
Kyle,"Thanks, kid.
"
FOX President,"Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode.
"
Woman,"What?  Mr. President, are you sure? 
"
FOX President,"I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900. 
"
Computer Voice,"Abort System initiated.
"
Programmer 1,"Awaiting confirmation.
"
Woman,"Mr. President, we need your final approval code.
"
FOX President,"President approval code  0-0-destruct-
"
Kyle,"Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!
"
FOX President,"Who are you?
"
Kyle,"Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
"
FOX President,"The end of Family Guy?
"
Woman,"Mr. President, we need final authorization!
"
FOX President,"Hold on, Julie!  What are you talking about, kid?
"
Kyle,"Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
"
FOX President,"You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
"
Kyle,"What manatees??!! 
"
Cartman,"Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!
"
Kyle,"No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
"
Woman,"Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!
"
Kyle,"Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
"
Cartman,"No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
"
FOX President,"Ah... I don't know who to listen to!
"
Cartman,"Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
"
FOX President,"Okay, I'll listen to you.  Julie?
"
Kyle,"Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
"
FOX President,"But he has a gun.
"
Kyle,"You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
"
Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle!
"
FOX President,"I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
"
Kyle,"Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
"
Cartman,"Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
"
FOX President,"I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.
"
Woman,"Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!
"
Kyle,"Do the right thing, Mr. President.
"
FOX President,"How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again.
"
Kyle,"I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
"
Cartman,"No gay speeches, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
"
Woman,"Five seconds, Mr. President! 
"
Kyle,"Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.
"
Woman,"Mr. President, we need a decision now!
"
FOX President,"Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.
"
Kyle,"Yes! 
"
Cartman,"No! No, I hate Family Guy!! 
"
Woman,"Air it! 
"
Lois,"Peter! You got a pink slip at work?
"
Peter,"You think that's bad? Remember the time I got a salmon helmet from Mohammad while wearing a toga?
"
Peter,"Coming Mohammad. 
"
Peter,"Wow, a salmon helmet! Thanks! 
"
Peter,"Anyway, what were we talking about?
"
Peter,"Oh yeah, my pink slip.
"
President Bush,"Hey, that wasn't bad at all. They just showed Mohammad standin' there, lookin' normal.
"
An Official,"Mr. President, the terrorists are retaliating!
"
President Bush,"What?!
"
Peter,"Or the time I- 
"
SNN anchor,"As soon as the image of Mohammad appeared, terrorist leader al-Zawahri announced the retaliation!
"
Al-Zawahri,"We warned you not to show Mohammad- But ""Family Guy"" did it anyways. So now, here is our retaliation on America!!!
"
American Male 1,"Hello, I am American.
"
American Male 2,"I'm American too.
"
American Male 1,"We like to crap own each other. 
"
President Bush,"Hello, I am the President Bush. I will crap on both of you. 
"
American Male 2,"Ugh! We love to crap!
"
American Female,"I'm American. I'm pregnant with a baby, but I'm not married.
"
American Male 3,"Let's crap. 
"
Jesus,"Look at me! I'm Jesus! Would you like me to crap on you, Mr. Bush? 
"
All,"Mmm, yummy yummy crap. 
"
Al-Zawahri,"Oh yeah, take THAT! We burned you! THAT WAS WAY FUNNIER THAN FAMILY GUY.
"
Waiter,"Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce?
"
Head Waiter,"Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check.
"
Chris,"I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!
"
Head Waiter,"Well what about the new waiter?
"
Chris,"The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high.
"
Towelie,"How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?
"
Male Diner,"Will you just place our order, please?
"
Towelie,"Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on.
"
Head Waiter,"Everything okay here?
"
Male Diner,"Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless!
"
Towelie,"Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!
"
Male Diner,"Yeah? Well you're a towel!
"
Towelie,"You're a towel!
"
Head Waiter,"All right, that's it! Get out of here! You're fired!
"
Towelie,"Yeah!
"
Head Waiter,"Not him, you!
"
Towelie,"Awww.
"
Towelie,"Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick.  But first, maybe I'll get a little high.  Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent.
"
Towelie,"A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS
By
Toweleeeie
This is a really good idea...
"
Publisher 1,"Aha. Mmm. Yes. Yes, I see. Well, that's quite a fascinating story, you being engineered as a towel with a computer chip that determines dryness.
"
Towelie,"Yep! And it's all true.
"
Publisher 1,"Chapters 4 through 8, however, seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips.
"
Towelie,"I guess I could edit those chapters down some.
"
Publisher 1,"Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir, but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs.
"
Towelie,"Huh? Why not?
"
Publisher 1,"Well, just the small trivial fact that... people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels.
"
Towelie,"Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives.
"
Publisher 1,"No. They won't. Because they're people. And you're a towel.
"
Towelie,"You're a towel!
"
Publisher 1,"No. I'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs. You're a towel.
"
Towelie,"Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems.  I'd better get a little high.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't.
"
Joint,"But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes you smart.
"
Towelie,"All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time.  Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? 
"
Towelie,"All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel.  person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels.  people.  This is a really good idea.
"
Publisher 2,"Ogh. Oh my God. Uh I could not believe a human being has led this kind of life, Mr...!
"
Towelie,"McTowelie. Steven McTowelie.
"
Publisher 2,"It's heartbreaking passages like this one: ""I am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me."" I know this company would be honored to publish this book. I just have one small question first. You're not... a towel, are you?
"
Towelie,"...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?
"
Publisher 2,"Right, I'm sorry.  Well Steveen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now. We're in business, sir.
"
Towelie,"All right!
"
Oprah,"Thank you so much.  Once in a while I come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life.  ""A Million Little Fibers"" is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory. Please welcome author Stevem McTowelie!  Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, ""How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?""
"
Towelie,"Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow-  person.
"
Oprah,"You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much,  and I think that people all over America could benefit...
"
Her crotch,"Oh God, there she goes again, babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on. She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!
"
Oprah,"...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down...
"
Her crotch,"Nobody knows what it's like to be Oprah's minge. All she does is work, never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again. A minge needs attention! At least a scratch once in a while!
"
Oprah,"Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you!
"
Mingie,"Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!
"
Oprah,"And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection! 
"
Towelie,"Really?  Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.
"
Oprah,"Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th. All right, is John Travolta available to be a guest the week after that? Okay, that might work better since it's Sweeps Week.
"
Mingie,"Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!
"
A voice,"Oh stop your complainin'! I'm tryin' to sleep back here.
"
Mingie,"Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?
"
Gary,"Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.
"
Mingie,"Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation.
"
Gary,"Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass.
"
Mingie,"She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.
"
Gary,"Well that'll never happen.
"
Mingie,"Not unless she gets fired.
"
Gary,"Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?
"
Mingie,"That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel.
"
Gary,"Ooo. How d'you know?
"
Mingie,"I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions.
"
Gary,"'Ow do we get proof?
"
Mingie,"We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.
"
Butler,"Mr. Rivera.
"
Geraldo,"What is it, Dimitri?
"
Dimitri,"There's somebody on the phone to speak with you. He says he has inside information for you that may discredit Oprah Winfrey. 
"
Geraldo,"Thith ith Geraldo.
"
Mingie,"'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.
"
Geraldo,"Who am I thpeaking with?!
"
Gary,"'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.
"
Mingie,"Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?
"
Geraldo,"What information do you have?
"
Mingie,"What'd 'e say?
"
Gary,"He wants to know what information we have.
"
Mingie,"Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you ""wha' 'e say?""!
"
Gary,"Stop wastin' my time.
"
Mingie,"Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!
"
Gary,"I didn't say ""stop wastin' my time,"" Geraldo did.
"
Geraldo,"What ith going on here?!
"
Mingie,"Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk. 
"
Gary,"Hallo?
"
Geraldo,"Who ith thith?
"
Gary,"This is Gary.
"
Geraldo,"Gary who?! What is your last name?!
"
Mingie,"Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.
"
Gary,"A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole.
"
Mingie,"Aw you stupid twit!!
"
Gary,"Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!
"
Mingie,"He didn't call you ""stupid twit,"" I did!! Now just tell 'im this:
"
Gary,"The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.
"
Geraldo,"A towel? A talking towel? That doethn't make any thenthe.
"
Mingie,"Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.
"
Gary,"You'd be surprised at things that can talk.
"
Geraldo,"What proof do you have of this accusation?!
"
Gary,"Just look into the author of ""A Million Little Fiyabers,"" and you'll discover the truth.
"
Geraldo,"And how do I go about that?  Hello? HELLO?!
"
Announcer,"This is Larry King Live.
"
Larry King,"My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie, author of the acclaimed book, ""A Million LIttle Fibers."" How are you tonight, Steven?
"
Towelie,"Well Larry, I'm a little high.
"
Larry King,"Your book has helped a lot of people beat addiction. What made you write it?
"
Towelie,"Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-
"
Larry King,"What? What's that? Oh ex- oh excuse me, Steven, I understand that we have a special report coming in. Joining us live from Afghanistan, here is Geraldo Rivera. 
"
Geraldo,"Hello? Larry, are you receiving me?
"
Larry King,"We're here, Geraldo. You're live on the show.
"
Geraldo,"Larry, this brave reporter has been days investigating and researching, and I have come up with a shocking discovery that is going to rock the balls and ass of the literary world! Steven McTowelie, author of ""A Million LIttle Fibers,"" is a towel!
"
Towelie,"You're a towel.
"
Geraldo,"No, you're a towel.
"
Towelie,"Well you're a beaner towel.
"
Geraldo,"What did you say??
"
Towelie,"I'm sorry. I'm high.
"
Aide 1,"This looks pretty bad, Oprah.
"
Aide 2,"Your fans look to you to be all-knowing and all-seeing, and you've just spent two weeks supporting a lying racist towel.
"
Mingie,"'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!
"
Gary,"Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire!
"
Mingie,"It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!
"
Gary,"And her Gary too.
"
Mingie,"Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!
"
Aide 2,"Oprah, we need to know what we're going to do.
"
Oprah,"What's the big deal? His book helped people. Why does it matter than he made some stuff up? Are people really going to be that mad?
"
Protester 1,"Your book got me to give up alcohol! But I thought you were a person!
"
Protester 2,"Yeah, we want our money back, you dumb towel!
"
Latino Protesters,"¡No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye? ¡No insultar Mexicanos! ¿Oye?
"
Towelie,"Oh God, I'm really in trouble now.  Hello?
"
Oprah,"Steven, it's Oprah. Can you come on my show again tomorrow?
"
Towelie,"Why?
"
Oprah,"We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to ""heighten"" certain things to make the book more relevant to people.
"
Towelie,"Hey yeah.
"
Oprah,"Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?
"
Towelie,"Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.
"
Oprah,"See you tomorrow.
"
Towelie,"All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say.  Maybe I should get a little high.  No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. 
"
Joint,"Aw, come on. You need to come up with ideas of what to say on Oprah.
"
Towelie,"But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble.
"
Joint,"Yeah. That's why you should only get a little high.
"
Towelie,"Well, maybe just a little high. 
"
Oprah,"Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie, whose memoirs many of you purchased after I made it my Book of the Month Selection. 
"
Mingie,"Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'!
"
Gary,"Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!
"
Oprah,"Now, it turns out that your name isn't really Steven. It's Towelie, correct?
"
Towelie,"Yeah.
"
Oprah,"And you are a towel.
"
Towelie,"Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah.
"
Oprah,"Can you explain to the audience why you said you weren't a towel before?
"
Towelie,"Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like...
"
Oprah,"Was it that you thought embellishing the story was okay if it helped people?
"
Towelie,"Yeah. Yeah, that's it!
"
Oprah,"Well you know what I think, Towelie? I think you're a LYING SACK OF SHIT!  You lied to all these people, and for what??!! To make money!! They bought your book thinking it was true!!
"
Man 1,"That's right!
"
Man 2,"Yeah.
"
Towelie,"But I thought you said-
"
Oprah,"How DARE you like to me and make me look foolish?!
"
Mingie,"What's this? What's she doin'?
"
Gary,"I don't understand, Mingie.
"
Oprah,"You think writing is a joke, you stupid towel?!
"
Man 3,"Yeah, you you get him, Oprah!
"
Audience,"Yeah!
"
Oprah,"You will not get away with this!
"
Mingie,"She's getting everyone back on 'er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!
"
Oprah,"You lied to me, Towelie! And therefore you have lied to America!  We are going to rise up against you!  Is this audience ready for a good old-fashioned lynching?!
"
Audience,"Yeah!
"
Towelie,"Huh?
"
Oprah,"Audience, if you look under your seats, you'll find your very own torches! 
"
Audience,"Whoa.
"
Gary,"Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?
"
Mingie,"There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!
"
Gary,"No!
"
Oprah,"We'll give you a five-second headstart.  One. Two. 
"
Towelie,"Hoooo!
"
Oprah,"Let's get him! 
"
Woman,"Burn him! Burn the towel!
"
Man 4,"Burn that which lies to Oprah!
"
Oprah,"Looks like your time is up, Towelie! I've led my adoring fans RIGHT to you!
"
Man 5,"All right Oprah!
"
Oprah,"I've shown my fans that... ugh! Ow! Wha?? 
"
Mingie,"All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! 
"
Oprah,"What the hell is this??!!
"
Mingie,"Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!
"
Gary,"Mingie, what're you doin'?
"
Mingie,"Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another! 
"
Oprah,"What is going on??!!
"
Mingie,"Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out!  I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!
"
Gary,"Mingie, have you lost your mind?
"
Mingie,"Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!
"
Gary,"Not like this, Mingie. Not like this!
"
Officer,"All right, gig is up. Put down the gun!
"
Mingie,"Stay back, mate!
"
Officer,"Drop the gun and step away.
"
Mingie,"I'm warnin' you!
"
Officer,"Put it down, I said-  Augh!  Gawhh 
"
Gary,"Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!
"
Mingie,"No turnin' back now, Gary.
"
Gary,"Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh.
"
Mingie,"Oh keep your head, Gary.
"
Gary,"I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke! 
"
Mingie,"Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up!  Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!
"
Man 6,"Oh my God, what are we goinna do?
"
Man 7,"You got us into this, towel. Think of somethin'!
"
Towelie,"All right, I'm gonna get a little high.  No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!
"
Geraldo,"I'm standing in the business district of central Chicago, where Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer and taken several people hostage. It is yet unconfirmed but believed that Oprah's asshole may be an accomplice in this as well.
"
SWAT Officer 1,"Got the walkie-talkie you asked for.
"
Mingie,"Put it underneath me.  Slowly, mate, slowly!  Now back off.  All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button.  This is Oprah's minge!
"
Lt. Nelson,"Hellow, I'm Lieutenant Nelson. What are your demands?
"
Mingie,"I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away.
"
Lt. Nelson,"All right, how about fresh underwear for one hostage.
"
Mingie,"I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!
"
Lt. Nelson,"All right, we'll work on it. Don't do anything foolish.  We don't have any time; this is the most unstable vagina I've ever talked to.
"
SWAT Officer 2,"O'Reilly, you got a shot?
"
O'Reilly,"I got it. 
"
Lt. Nelson,"Not with those hostages so close! It's too risky!
"
Gary,"Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us.
"
Mingie,"Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life.
"
Gary,"Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared.
"
Mingie,"We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me.
"
SWAT Officer 3,"Oprah's vagina, this is your last warning! Put down the gun!
"
Mingie,"If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!
"
Towelie,"Hey wait a minute.  Pssst! 
"
Mingie,"I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! 
"
SWAT Officer 4,"Hostages are clear!
"
Lt. Nelson,"All right, that's it. Take it out! 
"
Oprah,"AAAAaaah!
"
Mingie,"What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!
"
Gary,"Min...  Mingie.
"
Mingie,"Gary, what's, what's wrong?
"
Gary,"They got me, Mingie.
"
Mingie,"No... Oh no!
"
Gary,"Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood.
"
Mingie,"Try to hang on, Gary!
"
Gary,"Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge.
"
Mingie,"Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?
"
Gary,"I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!
"
Mingie,"I'm 'ere, Gary!
"
Gary,"Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?
"
Mingie,"Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate.
"
Gary,"Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?
"
Mingie,"Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!
"
Gary,"Tell me what you see, Mingie.
"
Mingie,"Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around.
"
Gary,"Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I- 
"
Mingie,"Gary? Gary, say somethin'.  You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary!  I'm comin' to see ya!
"
Oprah,"No! Don't! 
"
Lt. Nelson,"Oprah's going to be okay. Wish I could say the same for her vagina and asshole.
"
Detective,"That's a great idea you had to sneak the hostages inside the bank.
"
Man 7,"Yeah, it sure was. We're sorry we tried to burn you and murder you before.
"
Towelie,"Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. 
"
Joint,"Youuu said it. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?
"
Kyle,"Dick Cheney?
"
Mr. Mackey,"No, the last one.
"
Butters,"Bill Clinton.
"
Mr. Mackey,"No, Clinton's vice-president.  He is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues. Please welcome Al Gore. 
"
Stan,"Who?
"
Al Gore,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about...  ManBearPig. 
"
Kyle,"ManBearPig? 
"
Al Gore,"It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial.  But have no fear, because I am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say ""Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome."" The end.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.
"
Al Gore,"Thank you, class. Excelsior! 
"
Cartman,"Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.
"
Kyle,"Just play the game, fatass!
"
Stan,"Pass it to me, Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Hang on. I'm going to do something killer.  God damnit, stop it, Kyle!
"
Cartman,"All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. 
"
Kyle,"Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
"
Cartman,"Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 
"
Stan,"Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!
"
Beast,"FOOD!  Don't worry, it's not really ManBearPig. It's me, Al Gore.
"
Kyle,"We know. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing?
"
Al Gore,"I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker.   I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the ""real"" ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?
"
Randy,"Uhh, Stan?
"
Stan,"Oh, hey Dad.
"
Al Gore,"Hello.
"
Randy,"It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
"
Kyle,"Okay, Mr. Marsh. 
"
Al Gore,"Be safe. 
"
Randy,"Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
"
Stan,"Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
"
Randy,"ManBearPig?
"
Kyle,"He's half man and half bearpig
"
Cartman,"No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig.
"
Kyle,"That doesn't make any sense.
"
Stan,"He could be half bear, half manpig.
"
Randy,"Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
"
Stan,"But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends.
"
Stan,"Hello?
"
Al Gore,"Hello, this is Al Gore.
"
Stan,"Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.
"
Al Gore,"I was the vice president.
"
Stan,"I know.
"
Al Gore,"Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.
"
Stan,"Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy.
"
Al Gore,"Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either.
"
Stan,"No, no, it's not that.
"
Al Gore,"Yes it is. Nobody believes me!  I'm trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial!  I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once.
"
Stan,"Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.
"
Al Gore,"No you don't.
"
Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him.
"
Al Gore,"Are you serial?
"
Stan,"...Yes, I'm serial.
"
Al Gore,"Don't worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! 
"
Cartman,"Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, I don't get it.)
"
Stan,"Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. 
"
Al Gore,"Hi kids! Come on in!  Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?
"
Stan,"Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
"
Al Gore,"What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??
"
Stan,"NO.
"
Al Gore,"Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.
"
Stan,"Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
"
Al Gore,"Oh my God!  ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind! 
"
Kyle,"Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction.
"
Al Gore,"Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away.
"
Cartman,"Ah I don't think so, dude. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah, we've got school anyway.
"
Al Gore,"I can get you all excused from school. 
"
Cartman,"You... have that kind of power?
"
Al Gore,"Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!
"
Tour Guide,"Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado.  Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore.  Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?
"
Group,"Yeah.
"
Tour Guide,"Let's go cavin'. 
"
Tour Guide,"Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.
"
Al Gore,"Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?
"
Tour Guide,"Ahh, no.  Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's...
"
Al Gore,"All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.
"
Kyle,"What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
"
Al Gore,"Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.
"
Tour Guide,"These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named ""The Hanging Mushroom.""  And over here we have ""Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls.""  And finally, of course, the ""Two Sisters.""  Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.
"
Al Gore,"Groan! Groan! 
"
Tour Guide,"Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?
"
Al Gore,"Not yet.
"
Tour Guide,"All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name. 
"
Al Gore,"Kids! Kids, over here! Look.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Al Gore,"I bet this is where he's hiding.  This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on!  Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I'm serial! 
"
Tour Guide,"In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear. 
"
Group,"Wow...
"
Woman,"Take a picture of the sound, Steven. 
"
Stan,"Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
"
Al Gore,"Wait! Shhh.  Christ! He's here! Take this rope!  Be ready to tie him up!  I've got you now, you son of a bitch! 
"
Kyle,"What are you doing?! 
"
Stan,"Oh no!
"
Al Gore,"No!
"
The Boys,"Aaaah! 
"
Al Gore,"Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!
"
The Boys,"Help!
"
Al Gore,"Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!
"
Tour Guide,"O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now!  Go! Go! Go out, now! 
"
Kyle,"Hello?
"
Stan,"Help!
"
Kyle,"We're trapped in here!
"
Cartman,"Somebody get us some help down hyah!
"
Kyle,"Hello, help!
"
Cartman,"Hello??
"
Kenny,"(Hello!)
"
Stan,"Help!
"
Kyle,"Forget it! They can't hear us!
"
Kenny,"(What are we gonna do??)
"
Cartman,"You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
"
Stan,"Me??
"
Cartman,"You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
"
Stan,"Maybe there's another way out of here.
"
Kenny,"(Oh, no kidding.)
"
Kyle,"A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction.  Oh man, we're in big trouble here.
"
Cartman,"This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 
"
Kyle,"You see anything, Kenny??
"
Kenny,"(No, nothing!) 
"
Kyle,"Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??
"
Cartman,"No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.
"
Kyle,"Cartman, you okay??  You need help??
"
Cartman,"I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 
"
Kyle,"It looks like we're completely sealed in.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, No shit.)
"
Stan,"There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 
"
Kyle,"Maybe we should go for it.
"
Cartman,"You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
"
Kyle,"Why?
"
Cartman,"I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
"
Stan,"Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
"
Cartman,"No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
"
Kyle,"No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon.
"
Cartman,"That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
"
Kyle,"Aw, dude! 
"
Miner 1,"The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area. 
"
Miner 2,"Does anybody know who these kids are?
"
Miner 1,"No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days.
"
Al Gore,"Excuse me, Excuse me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial!
"
Miner 1,"What do you mean? The cave-in is over.
"
Al Gore,"I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.
"
Miner 1,"What's that? 
"
Fireman,"What is that, a pigbearman?
"
Al Gore,"No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!
"
Stan,"I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
"
Kyle,"They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
"
Cartman,"I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
"
Kyle,"Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
"
Stan,"Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
"
Cartman,"All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 
"
Kyle,"C-Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
"
Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?
"
Cartman,"Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
"
Kyle,"Dude, get away from me!
"
Cartman,"Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 
"
Al Gore,"Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial!
"
Miner 3,"Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do?
"
Al Gore,"I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!
"
Miner 3,"Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too.
"
Al Gore,"They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial! 
"
Police Officer,"Do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here?
"
Miner 2,"Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends.
"
Cartman,"All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. 
"
Stan,"Dude, he's really sick. 
"
HBC Reporter,"It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in. Three days without food and time is certainly running out. The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow.
"
Miner 1,"All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den.
"
Ranger,"Smuggler's Den?
"
Tour Guide,"Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see? 
"
Miner 1,"Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put.
"
Kyle,"Stan! Stan, wake up!
"
Stan,"Huh? What? Have they come for us?
"
Kyle,"No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. 
"
Cartman,"Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.
"
Stan,"Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
"
Cartman,"I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.
"
Kyle,"We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die.
"
Stan,"How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
"
Kyle,"Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
"
Cartman,"NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
"
Kyle,"Come on come on! Pull!
"
Stan,"Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!
"
Cartman,"Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. 
"
Kyle,"What the hell is that??
"
Stan,"Cartman?
"
Cartman,"You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 
"
Al Gore,"This is the end of you, ManBearPig.  Excelsior!
"
Kenny,"(We're almost there!)
"
Stan,"I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!
"
Cartman,"Yes you do! 
"
Kyle,"What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 
"
Cartman,"No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
"
Kyle,"Ruuun! 
"
Miner 1,"That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!
"
Fireman 2,"You're calling off the rescue?
"
Miner 1,"We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.
"
Fireman 2,"Well what if the children aren't dead?
"
Miner 1,"Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there. 
"
Al Gore,"Nothing left alive...  I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it.
"
Stan,"Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
"
Cartman,"Grab my hand.
"
Kyle,"Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
"
Cartman,"I can't kick!
"
Kyle,"Yes you can!
"
Cartman,"I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
"
Kyle,"I need your help!
"
Cartman,"No, you just have to save me. 
"
Stan,"Kyle! No!
"
Al Gore,"We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more.
"
Tour Guide,"Oh Jesus, here we go again. 
"
Al Gore,"I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4.  I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play.  And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him.
"
Stan,"Agh.
"
Miner 4,"Oh my God! 
"
Miner 1,"It's the kids! 
"
Miner 4,"They're alive! 
"
Al Gore,"Kids! I saved you!
"
Stan,"Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!
"
Al Gore,"Hyeah right. The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser. 
"
Kyle,"We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
"
Cartman,"No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.
"
Stan,"Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.
"
Cartman,"Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 
"
Kyle,"Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?
"
Cartman,"It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
"
Tour Guide 2,"Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room.
"
Cartman,"That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?
"
Tour Guide 2,"Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars.
"
Cartman,"Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!
"
Kyle,"You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
"
Cartman,"Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!
"
Al Gore,"Well, my work here is done. I've killed MBP, and now I must save the world from something else. Maybe I'll make a movie. A movie starring me. Then people will take me super-serial. 
"
Cartman,"Eh! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!
"
Liane,"Eric, why would you do such a thing?
"
Cartman,"I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
"
Mr. Mackey,"You know that's not the point!
"
Cartman,"Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
"
Liane,"That's very naughty, Eric.
"
Cartman,"Well he called me chubby!
"
Mr. Mackey,"We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!
"
Liane,"I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like.  I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day.  He just never listens.
"
Cartman,"Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
"
Liane,"It's not him, it's you, Eric.  I don't know what to do with you.
"
Cartman,"Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
"
Liane and Eric,"My mom's the best mom, better than your mom.It's singing together in harmony.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?
"
Announcer,"They're every parent's worst nightmare. 
"
Girl,"Shut up! I hate you! I hate you! 
"
Announcer,"Kids completely out of control. 
"
Boy,"Look, I'm skating, I'm skating!
"
Announcer,"It's time to call Nanny 911.  We've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis.  Parents of America, help is on the way!  Tonight...
"
Cartman,"Mom, I need another energy drink! 
"
Announcer,"This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
"
Cartman,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
Announcer,"And Nanny Stella is selected to set him straight. 
"
Stella,"It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! 
"
Cartman,"Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!
"
Liane,"Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins.
"
Cartman,"Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. 
"
Stella,"Hello. I'm Nanny Stella.
"
Liane,"Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. 
"
Stella,"And you must be Eric.
"
Cartman,"Mom, I want a Twinkie.
"
Liane,"All, all right dear. 
"
Stella,"Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done.
"
Cartman,"Ha! Hahahahahaha
"
Stella,"I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
"
Cartman,"No thanks, I'd rather naught.
"
Stella,"Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. 
"
Cartman,"The hell do you think you're doing?
"
Stella,"Come on.  This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed.  Eric, no! This is not acceptable! 
"
Cartman,"Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
"
Stella,"All right, that's it!  You're going to time-out! 
"
Cartman,"Time out?
"
Stella,"Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes.
"
Cartman,"And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
"
Stella,"It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
"
Cartman,"Whoa, how did I do that? 
"
Stella,"Eric, you have to stay in time-out!
"
Cartman,"Ummm, no?
"
Stella,"Come on, you don't have a choice.
"
Cartman,"All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
"
Stella,"Eric, you need to listen to me.  This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level.  Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?
"
Cartman,"I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
"
Stella,"Well then, I'll just have to stand right here!  Oh!  He spit in my mouth!
"
Liane,"Yeah, it's best to avoid his level.
"
Stella,"All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
"
Cartman,"Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
"
Stella,"Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?
"
Cartman,"Because you took my Xbox.
"
Stella,"Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
"
Cartman,"Well, yeah.
"
Stella,"And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
"
Cartman,"Yeah. I guess so.
"
Stella,"See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?
"
Cartman,"Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
"
Stella,"Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you.
"
Cartman,"Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
"
Stella,"Oh, I just never had kids.
"
Cartman,"Why not?
"
Stella,"It... just... didn't happen.
"
Cartman,"You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
"
Stella,"Why you, you...  you little bastard! How dare you?!
"
Liane,"Eric, naughty.
"
Stella,"What kind of  monster would-
"
Cartman,"Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 
"
Stella,"That's it!  I'm not doing this!
"
Liane,"Oh, but we really need some help. 
"
Stella,"Find yourself another nanny... television show!
"
Announcer,"Coming up next, it's Super Nanny! Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through. 
"
Jo,"This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!
"
Jo,"Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman.
"
Doctor,"I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis.
"
Liane,"What do you mean?
"
Doctor,"I mean,  she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. 
"
Jo,"From heeell! It's from heeell!
"
Liane,"Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
"
Doctor,"Well there... is... one more show you could still try.
"
Announcer,"When good dogs go bad, there's one man who's their best friend. Cesar Millan.
"
Cesar,"No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer.
"
Liane,"Please, come in.
"
Cesar,"So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
"
Liane,"Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life.
"
Cesar,"So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
"
Cartman,"You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
"
Cesar,"See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him.
"
Cartman,"Not interested I'm me?
"
Cesar,"See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, well I don't see why-
"
Cesar,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"Hey!
"
Cesar,"Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation.
"
Cartman,"Mom, this guy doesn't-
"
Cesar,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"Ah! Quit it!
"
Liane,"What what is it that you're doing?
"
Cesar,"Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant.
"
Cartman,"Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
"
Cesar,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"KNOCK IT OFF!
"
Cesar,"Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response.
"
Liane,"Oh, that's very interesting.
"
Cesar,"I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
"
Cartman,"I'm not fat!
"
Cesar,"Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
"
Liane,"Well, no, I don't.
"
Cesar,"Go on, take your son for a walk.
"
Cartman,"Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
"
Cesar,"See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along.
"
Cartman,"Mom, this is degrading!
"
Cesar,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! 
"
Cesar,"Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. 
"
Cartman,"Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.
"
Cesar,"Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. 
"
Cartman,"Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!
"
Cesar,"Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you.
"
Cartman,"Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
"
Liane,"Tsst. 
"
Cartman,"Mom!
"
Cesar,"Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!
"
Announcer,"And now, back to the Dog Whisperer.
"
Cesar,"It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
"
Cartman,"God dammit stop ignoring me!
"
Cesar,"You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.
"
Liane,"Ahall right.
"
Cartman,"This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
"
Liane,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"Quit it, mom!
"
Liane,"It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
"
Cesar,"Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
"
Cartman,"Ooo, Colonel?
"
Cesar,"I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. 
"
Cartman,"Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
"
Cesar,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
"
Cesar,"I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. 
"
Cartman,"Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
"
Cesar,"We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
"
Cartman,"Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
"
Cesar,"We need him to become relaxed and submissive.
"
Cartman,"Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
"
Liane,"Oh, very good, sweetie.
"
Cesar,"Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant.
"
Cartman,"Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
"
Cesar,"See?
"
Cartman,"Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!
"
Cesar,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"You can't do that to me, I-
"
Cesar,"Tsst. 
"
Cartman,"Goddamnit, you just can't-
"
Cesar,"Tsst. 
"
Cartman,"Seriously! Ey? Eh... 
"
Cesar,"I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
"
Liane,"Wow, I have a lot to learn.
"
Cartman,"Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken!  That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine!  I hate you! I'm running away!
"
Liane,"Oh dear. 
"
Cesar,"It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle.
"
Liane,"But what if he does run away.
"
Cesar,"Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. 
"
Butters,"Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! 
"
Cartman,"Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
"
Stan,"You can't stay here.
"
Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
"
Kyle,"You'er not staying at my house either.
"
Cartman,"All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
"
Butters,"No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
"
Cartman,"Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?!  His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people!  All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man.
"
Kenny,"(Fuck you.)
"
Cartman,"Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere!  Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! 
"
Butters,"Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
"
Cartman,"Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
"
Jimmy,"Who is your best friend?
"
Cartman,"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
"
Jimmy,"What's my last name?
"
Cartman,"Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
"
Craig,"...But I hate you.
"
Cartman,"...Should that really matter at a time like this?
"
Cartman,"This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
"
Cartman,"All right, I'm back.
"
Liane,"Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home.
"
Cartman,"Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
"
Liane,"Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was.
"
Cartman,"That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
"
Liane,"Cesar...
"
Cesar,"How is the painting going?
"
Cartman,"Aw, Goddammit!
"
Cesar,"Oh look it came back.
"
Liane,"Yup, just like you said he would.
"
Cartman,"What is he still doing here?!
"
Liane,"He said he's hungry. What should I do?
"
Cesar,"Well let's feed it.
"
Cartman,"What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
"
Cesar,"This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 
"
Cesar,"Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?
"
Liane,"Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!
"
Cesar,"Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! 
"
Cartman,"Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
"
Cesar,"You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it.
"
Cartman,"I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
"
Liane,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
"
Liane,"Tsst. 
"
Cartman,"Seriously! Mom-
"
Liane,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
"
Liane,"Tsst. 
"
Cartman,"Mom?!
"
Liane,"Tsst.
"
Cartman,"Mom? Mom...
"
Liane,"I did it! 
"
Cesar,"You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. 
"
Liane,"Oh... Oh my gosh!
"
Cesar,"See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state.
"
Liane,"He's never done this before.
"
Cesar,"Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
"
Liane,"I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. 
"
Cesar,"Now you can give him a snack.  Good, this is really good. Now try a command.
"
Liane,"Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed.  Oh my goodness. I can't believe it.
"
Cesar,"This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now.
"
Liane,"I am the pack leader! 
"
Cesar,"Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
"
Liane,"Sounds divine!
"
Cartman,"Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?
"
Cesar,"So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?
"
Liane,"Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him.
"
Cesar,"That's greeat!
"
Liane,"The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
"
Cesar,"Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend.
"
Liane,"There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child.
"
Cesar,"Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality.
"
Liane,"Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. 
"
Cartman,"Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom.
"
Butters,"Kill your mom?
"
Cartman,"She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
"
Stan,"Dude, have you lost more weight?
"
Cartman,"Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
"
Kyle,"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
"
Cartman,"She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
"
Stan,"Dude, we're not killing your mom.
"
Cartman,"Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
"
Stan,"Where am I supposed to get a gun?
"
Cartman,"Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
"
Stan,"I'm not shooting anybody.
"
Cartman,"Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face.
"
Kyle,"NO, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!
"
Cartman,"You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son.  You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore!  Goodbye, Mother. 
"
Cartman's Conscience,"Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.
"
Cartman,"No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
"
Cartman's Good Side,"She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being.
"
Cartman,"She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
"
Cartman's Bad Side,"No, she's just... out to make you suffer!
"
Cartman,"Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
"
Cartman's Good Side,"The world doesn't revolve around me?
"
Cartman,"Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. 
"
Cartman's Good Side,"The world doesn't revolve around me!
"
Cartman's Bad Side,"Idiot! 
"
Liane,"Why Eric, you made your own breakfast.
"
Cartman,"Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.
"
Liane,"And you're studying before school?
"
Cartman,"Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
"
Liane,"Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you.
"
Cartman,"Tha... thank you?
"
Liane,"I love you, sweetie.
"
Cartman,"'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. 
"
Liane,"Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
"
Cesar,"How is the child doing?
"
Liane,"Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son.
"
Cesar,"That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too.
"
Liane,"You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night.
"
Cesar,"Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles.
"
Liane,"Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
"
Cesar,"No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. 
"
Cartman,"I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 
"
Liane,"Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?
"
Cartman,"No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
"
Liane,"Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward?  And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger.
"
Cartman,"Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
"
Liane,"Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. 
"
Cartman,"Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
"
Kyle,"We're over here, by the cart. 
"
Cartman,"Okay, I'm back.
"
Stan,"Dude! We've been waiting forever!
"
Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!
"
Kyle,"If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
"
Cartman,"Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
"
Kenny,"(I think Kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)
"
Cartman,"Heheh, totally, heheh.
"
Kyle,"Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
"
Randy,"Stan?  Stan?
"
Stan,"H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.
"
Randy,"Stan!
"
Stan,"What?!
"
Randy,"You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
"
Stan,"I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
"
Randy,"...I'm not a r-tard. 
"
Stan,"All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
"
Kyle,"See where I am? It's this way. 
"
Cartman,"Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
"
Kyle,"Wow, look at all these people playing right now.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
"
Stan,"Oh crap! It's that guy again! 
"
Kyle,"Who is this?
"
Stan,"This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
"
Cartman,"Get out of here, asshole!
"
Stan,"He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
"
Kyle,"It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 
"
Stan,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
"
Kyle,"You bastard! 
"
Cartman,"Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 
"
Cartman,"That sonofabitch!
"
Kyle,"Who is that guy?
"
Stan,"Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
"
Rep,"World of Warcraft support line.
"
Stan,"Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!
"
Rep,"O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other.
"
Stan,"Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
"
Cartman,"He's a God damned butthole!
"
Rep,"Really? That's odd.  More people calling in about their characters getting killed. 
"
Co-Worker,"Oh no.
"
Rep,"Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network.  Better tell the guys upstairs.
"
President,"Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players..
"
Member 1,"Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.
"
Member 2,"We've got to delete him from the servers.
"
President,"We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to kill our admins. And he grows stronger every day.
"
Member 3,"Jesus...
"
Jim,"I've gotta get home! My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!
"
President,"Jim, your kids' characters are already dead.
"
Jim,"No...  No...  They just started playing!
"
Member 2,"What kind of person would do this?
"
President,"Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...haw absolutely no life.
"
Member 3,"How do you kill...that which has no life? 
"
Nelson,"Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?
"
Randy,"Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
"
Nelson,"Is that a computer game?
"
Randy,"No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  ""Hello.""  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 
"
Nelson,"Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. 
"
Randy,"What?? Why?? Why?!
"
Cartman,"My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
"
Kyle,"The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!
"
Craig,"He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!
"
Tweek,"Mine too!
"
Cartman,"We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
"
Token,"Hey yeah!
"
Jimmy,"We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
"
Clyde,"Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time.
"
Stan,"Ddue, we have to try.
"
Clyde,"I've got better things to do.
"
Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
"
Clyde,"I'm just gonna stop playing.
"
Cartman,"When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?
"
Clyde,"No.
"
Cartman,"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
"
Clyde,"All right all right, I'll do it!
"
Jimmy,"So what's the p-plan?
"
Cartman,"All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
"
All,"To victory!
"
Butters,"I don't play World of Warcraft.
"
Cartman,"Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!
"
Butters,"Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.
"
Cartman,"Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
"
Butters,"O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.
"
Cartman,"All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff.
"
Token,"Okay.
"
Jason,"Got it.
"
Cartman,"The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
"
Jimmy,"All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.
"
Timmy,"Timmy!
"
Cartman,"This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-
"
Butters,"Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh?
"
Cartman,"Butters? What the hell are you doing?
"
Butters,"I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
"
Cartman,"You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
"
Butters,"Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
"
Cartman,"So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
"
Butters,"I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
"
Stan,"Come on, let's do this!
"
Craig,"Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30.
"
Cartman,"Then let's move out! 
"
Stan,"Look! There he is!
"
Cartman,"Everyone hold! 
"
Kyle,"He's targeting us.
"
Cartman,"Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! 
"
Tweek,"Aaaa!  I'm burning! Oh Jesus I'm burning! 
"
Jimmy,"Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down. 
"
Ike,"I have poop on my pants.
"
Kyle,"Ike, look out! 
"
Cartman,"All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow!  Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde!  Clyde! Clyde, you asshole!  Goddamnit we lost Clyde!
"
Randy,"Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 
"
Stan,"Dad??
"
Randy,"Yeah, I'm playing from the office.
"
Stan,"Dad, get off our teamspeak line!
"
Token,"That's it, I'm dead!
"
Stan,"That's it, screw this game!
"
Cartman,"Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 
"
Member 3,"Oh Jesus...Oh God no...
"
President,"What?
"
Member 3,"He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands.
"
Member 1,"How many people's characters were in there?
"
Member 2,"Over five thousand. 
"
Member 1,"There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them?
"
President,"Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft.
"
Member 5,"No! Nooooooooo!
"
Cartman,"What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
"
Stan,"Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
"
Cartman,"Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft.
"
Kyle,"We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
"
Cartman,"I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
"
Stan,"We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
"
Cartman,"That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
"
Kyle,"Boars?
"
Cartman,"There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
"
Kyle,"Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
"
Cartman,"Yes.  Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around,  or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
"
Paul Stanley,"Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes!Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall!Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winYeah! Live! Yeah!Win! 
"
Member 3,"Sir, you'd better have a look at this! Four of our subscribers...They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks.
"
President,"My God...they must have no lives at all.
"
Member 3,"A hope?
"
President,"A chance.
"
Paul Stanley,"Llive to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyesLive to win, take it all, just keep fighting 'till you fall&lt;p&gt;Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winLive to winLive to winYeah, win 
"
Kyle,"Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.
"
Cartman,"Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
"
President,"The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado.
"
Member 1,"Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?
"
Member 5,"We ran the numbers: even with their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter!
"
Member 1,"There has to be...someway we can help them.
"
Member 6,"What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths?
"
Member 7,"Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to speak of that sword!
"
Thomas,"But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.
"
Member 7,"It is not an option!
"
Thomas,"What is this sword?
"
President,"Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.
"
Member 7,"But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.
"
Thomas,"But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves.
"
Member 1,"Who foretold this prophecy?
"
President,"Soltzman. He's an accountant.
"
President,"Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths.  We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them.
"
Cartman,"All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!
"
Stan,"I'm in.
"
Kyle,"Me too.
"
Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
Cartman,"Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence.
"
Kyle,"Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
"
Cartman,"Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?
"
Stan,"15 agility.
"
Cartman,"Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
"
Stan,"'K.
"
Kyle,"Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
"
Cartman,"Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?
"
Liane,"Yes hon?
"
Cartman,"More Hot Pockets!
"
Liane,"Right away, hon. 
"
Stan,"That's übercool.
"
Cartman,"All right, everyone ready?
"
Kyle/Stan,"Ready.
"
Cartman,"Let's go get him! 
"
Stan,"Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire.
"
Cartman,"Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
"
Kyle,"What's the autolocate macro?
"
Cartman,"Command-0. 
"
Kyle,"Okay, right behind Stan.
"
Cartman,"Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
"
Stan,"Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.
"
Cartman,"Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
"
Cartman,"Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
"
Kyle,"No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage.
"
Cartman,"Christ...
"
Kyle,"Cast on him again.
"
Cartman,"Everyone target scorpions.
"
Randy,"Yes?
"
Member 1,"We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge.
"
Randy,"That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.
"
President,"Where is he?!
"
Randy,"Who are you?
"
President,"Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle!
"
Member 1,"Unless they have this sword,  your son's character is going to die!
"
Randy,"Nn-Oh my God! 
"
Cartman,"Kyle! Fire spell!
"
Kyle,"Aaaa...  AH! Huh?! 
"
Stan,"Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?
"
Kyle,"Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! 
"
Stan,"Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! 
"
Cartman,"Wait, we need Ben-Gay. 
"
Stan,"Hurry dude!
"
Cartman,"I'm going as fast as I can!
"
Stan,"Kyle, you have to keep playing.
"
Kyle,"I can't. Just leave me behind.
"
Stan,"We can't do this without you now! Come on! 
"
Randy,"Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!
"
Sharon,"I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.
"
Member 1,"Stupid?
"
Randy,"Where?!
"
Sharon,"I don't know.
"
Randy,"Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!
"
Sharon,"So what?
"
The three men,"So what?! 
"
President,"We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail.
"
Member 1,"Ih if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online.
"
President,"I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you?
"
Member 1,"No, I have a life. 
"
Randy,"Give me the sword.
"
Member 1,"You?
"
Randy,"I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
"
Member 1,"We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!
"
Randy,"Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword.  Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! 
"
Randy,"Where's your car?
"
Member 1,"We took a cab here!
"
Randy,"Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
"
Cartman,"All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
"
Stan,"You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
"
Cartman,"It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!
"
Liane,"What hon?
"
Cartman,"Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
Liane,"Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? 
"
Cartman,"All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
"
Randy,"World of Warcraft! I need to play!
"
Greeter,"Our demo is set up right over by the- 
"
Randy,"Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! 
"
Stan,"Dude, I'm almost dead.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, cast arcane missile!
"
Kyle,"I'm out of mana, I told you.
"
Stan,"I've gotta heal. 
"
Randy,"Staaan! 
"
Stan,"Dad? Not now!
"
Randy,"Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.
"
Stan,"Dad, how did you get that?!
"
Randy,"No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?
"
Stan,"Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
"
Randy,"Okay. 
"
Cartman,"Stan, what the hell are you doing?! 
"
Stan,"I got it! 
"
Randy,"Augh!
"
Stan,"Dad!
"
Randy,"Stan... 
"
Stan,"Dad, no!  You killed my father. 
"
Cartman,"His shield and armor spells are down!
"
Kyle,"Attack! 
"
Cartman,"Looks like you're about to get pwned.  Heeyeah! 
"
Stan,"Dad? Dad?
"
Randy,"Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.
"
Stan,"I know you do, Dad.
"
Randy,"Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
"
Member 1,"They did it!
"
President,"Our world is saved! 
"
Man 1,"They did it! They killed him! 
"
Man 2,"They did it!
"
Woman,"They killed him! We can come out!
"
Cartman,"Yes!
"
Stan,"We did it!
"
Cartman,"Yeah!
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Kyle,"Yeah yeah.
"
Cartman,"All right, yay.
"
Kenny,"(Woohoo! Oh man!)
"
Cartman,"We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
"
Kyle,"That was such über pwnage
"
Stan,"I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
"
Cartman,"What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
"
Kyle,"Oh yeah.
"
Cartman,"Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
"
Stan,"Got it.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like-  Oh hello, Mr. Mackey.
"
Mr. Mackey,"All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay?  Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! 
"
Butters,"What's a urinal?
"
Stan,"A wall toilet for peeing in.
"
Mr. Mackey,"And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!
"
Jimmy,"Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
"
Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
"
Kyle,"Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
"
Cartman,"Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!
"
Officer 1,"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on.
"
Mr. Mackey,"But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
"
Officer 1,"But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
"
Narrator,"The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in:  The Mystery of the Urinal Turd.
"
Officer 1,"So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime.
"
Frank,"That sure is a mystery.
"
Joe,"Yeah, it sounds super-hard.
"
Frank,"Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.
"
Joe,"F-really?
"
Frank,"Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now.
"
Joe,"Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.
"
Frank,"My clue is kind of pointing this way.
"
Joe,"Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue.
"
Frank,"I've still got a raging clue.
"
Joe,"My clue's pointing over there now!
"
Frank,"Oh, let's follow that clue! 
"
Stan,"Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
"
Kyle,"Not yet.
"
Cartman,"They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
"
Kyle,"Will you shut up about 9/11!
"
Cartman,"Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
"
Kyle,"Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
"
Cartman,"Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
"
Kyle,"Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
"
Stan,"Yeah, at least one-fourth.
"
Kyle,"Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
"
Cartman,"...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! 
"
Butters,"Hey, fellas!
"
Cartman,"Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
"
Butters,"Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
"
Cartman,"Aha! Do you see?
"
Kyle,"Where did you hear that?
"
Butters,"From Eric.
"
Cartman,"I rest my case.
"
Kyle,"Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
"
Butters,"Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
"
Cartman,"That's right, Butters.
"
Kyle,"Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
"
Cartman,"What? People see the truth?
"
Butters,"Can I go now?
"
Cartman,"You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 
"
Kyle,"Oh no...
"
Cartman,"It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
"
Leroy,"This is my frog.  He doesn't have a name. He's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?
"
Cartman,"Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"All right, Eric, you can go next.
"
Cartman,"For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 
"
Kyle,"Oh Christ...
"
Cartman,"We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
"
Clyde,"Whoa...
"
Cartman,"So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Me??!
"
Cartman,"Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
"
Kyle,"Hey Token.  You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? 
"
Butters,"Waaaah! 
"
Kyle,"All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!
"
Sheila,"Hello bubbe, how was school today?
"
Kyle,"Terrible.
"
Sheila,"Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad.
"
Kyle,"But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
"
Sheila,"Whatwhatwhaaat?!
"
Sheila,"We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
"
Principal Victoria,"Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened.
"
Skeeter,"Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth.
"
Other men,"Oh no, oh brother, oh God.
"
Mr. Adler,"That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
"
Other men,"Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!
"
Sheila,"Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!
"
Mr. Mackey,"More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!
"
Jimbo,"He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
"
Mr. Mackey,"No, I'm not saying they're related!
"
Randy,"How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! 
"
Skeeter,"It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!
"
Richard,"Who else could it have been?
"
Det. Yates,"This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh no, not the Goddamned-
"
Narrator,"The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in:  The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy.
"
Det. Yates,"So that's about the long and short of it, Hardly Boys. There were two towers that stood right here,  and they're gone.
"
Frank,"And nobody knows who's responsible?
"
Det. Yates,"There are theories, but, nobody's certain.
"
Joe,"Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?
"
Frank,"Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue.
"
Joe,"Really?
"
Frank,"Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue.
"
Joe,"Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now.
"
Frank,"Mine's pointing to the left.
"
Joe,"Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it.
"
Frank,"Okay, let's follow your raging clue.
"
Joe,"Oofff.
"
Randy,"Godspeed.
"
Stan,"Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Aaaah!
"
Stan,"Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
"
Kyle,"I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
"
Stan,"Well why did you have to involve me??
"
Kyle,"It's not my fault.
"
Stan,"All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
"
Kyle,"Really?
"
Stan,"Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
"
Kyle,"......Dude.
"
Stan,"That's all I needed. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela , the school janitor. Okay?  He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face!  So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Mr. Mackey!  We got him.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Huh?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"We caught the person that did it.
"
Stan,"Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
"
Man,"Aw geez. Come on in, kids.  It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day.
"
Kyle,"They are?
"
Kyle,"What? No no no.
"
Stan,"Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
"
Kyle,"...That's retarded.
"
Kyle,"There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
"
Kyle,"Code 234
"
Kyle,"What is it?
"
Kyle,"Anthrax?!
"
Kyle,"Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?
"
Clyde,"I don't know. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room.  Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at!  Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here.
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, that's good!  Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade!  Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!
"
Mr. Donovan,"Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know...
"
Kyle,"Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.
"
Donald Rumsfeld,"Come on in, Mr. President. 
"
Kyle,"Uh, Mr. President, my name is-
"
Bush,"SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything!  We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging!
"
Kyle,"Really?
"
Bush,"People? You mean sheeple. We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance. Just one more... leak...  to fix... 
"
Bush,"You've been a thorn in our side for too long, I'm afraid.
"
Bush,"Too late. 
"
Stan,"JESUS CHRIST!!
"
Rumsfeld,"Hahaha. He died like a pig.
"
Bush,"Some pigs never learn.
"
Kyle,"No. Way.
"
Stan,"He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
"
Bush,"Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever.
"
Kyle,"...Really??
"
Stan,"Why?!
"
Bush,"Oldest reason in the world. Money. The towers fell and the American sheeple all waved their flags.  Finally we could invade Iraq,  and get the oil which made us all richer than before.
"
Rumsfeld,"Beauutiful money, hahahaha!
"
Kyle,"...Really??
"
Stan,"Is the whole government in on this?
"
Bush,"We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good-bye, boys. 
"
Cheney,"Dangit! I missed again!
"
Bush,"For Christ's sake, Cheney! 
"
Stan,"Kyle! Run! 
"
Bush,"KILL THEM!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?!  Let me assure you, there is nothing funny... about going up to a nice, clean, unsuspectin' urinal,  'kay, droppin' your pants then... turnin' around... squattin' over that urinal, 'kay, maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands, m'kay, and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see.  Oh yeah, that's real funny!  I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing I DO! M'kay?! 
"
Stan,"All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude.  We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw.
"
Kyle,"It just... doesn't seem right.
"
Stan,"Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time.
"
Kyle,"Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 
"
Stan,"Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
"
Kyle,"Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here! 
"
Man 1,"Hey!
"
Man 2,"Ogh!
"
Kyle,"Dude! What the hell is going on?!
"
Stan,"What who said?
"
Kyle,"Dude, we aren't going to kill you. 
"
Stan,"Oh God!
"
Bearded Man,"It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!
"
Kyle,"Who the fuck are you?!
"
Bearded Man,"There's no time! come on! 
"
Kyle,"Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
"
Stan,"Who are you?
"
Bearded Man,"I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed.
"
Kyle,"You f-figured this thing all out?
"
Bearded Man,"Not me. My mystery-solving sons. Come on in, boys.  My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue.
"
Frank,"Gave us both a clue.
"
Mr. Hardly,"That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues.
"
Joe,"I was getting a clue like every two minutes.
"
Frank,"I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.
"
Mr. Hardly,"Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.
"
Frank,"It was huuuge.
"
Mr. Hardly,"That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.
"
Stan,"Aw Jesus...
"
Kyle,"Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
"
Mr. Hardly,"For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?
"
Bush,"That's quite enough, Hardly!  Don't believe what he says, boys; we caused 9/11.  It's all right here in these secret documents,  but you'll never get them. 
"
Kyle,"I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
"
Bush,"Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing.
"
Kyle,"Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
"
Bush,"We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?
"
Mr. Hardly,"Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here? 
"
Stan,"How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
"
Kyle,"Stan! What the fuck?!
"
Stan,"It was all planned out!
"
Kyle,"You knew this whole time? Why?
"
Stan,"Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
"
Kyle,"What??
"
Stan,"The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
"
Kyle,"So you blamed the government?!
"
Mr. Hardly,"And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11!
"
Stan,"Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?
"
Kyle,"So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
"
Stan,"Yuh.
"
Kyle,"So then, who was responsible for 9/11?
"
Stan,"Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
"
Frank,"Yeah. What are you, retarded? 
"
Mr. Hardly,"Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!
"
Mr. Mackey,"When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!
"
Cartman,"And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, ""Do you smell lemon grass?"", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
"
A Hall Monitor,"Eric, I have to take you to the principal's office.
"
Cartman,"What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!
"
Hall Monitor,"I've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office.
"
Cartman,"Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
"
Hall Monitor,"I'm just doin' my job.
"
Cartman,"I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately.
"
Cartman,"Aw Goddamnit!
"
Principal Victoria,"Come on in, Eric. 
"
Cartman,"I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. 
"
Cartman,"The hall monit- me?
"
Mr. Mackey,"You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? 
"
Principal Victoria,"If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me.
"
Cartman,"Auth- authoritah?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power.
"
Cartman,"Ahem. Me?
"
Cartman,"There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
"
Car Salesman,"Hey, kid, get outta there.
"
Cartman,"That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
"
Boy,"What?
"
Cartman,"You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
"
Boy,"It's right here. 
"
Cartman,"All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. 
"
Boy,"What? You can't just push me up against the-
"
Cartman,"Argh!
"
Boy,"Aah!
"
Cartman,"I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!
"
Teacher,"And so this shape with four sides is what, class?
"
Cartman,"Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
"
Teacher,"What are you doing?!
"
Cartman,"I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. 
"
Teacher,"I don't think that's really necessary.
"
Cartman,"Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 
"
Fillmore,"Ike has a crush on teacher!
"
Class,"Ike has a crush on teacher! 
"
Teacher,"That's enough, class!  Okay, well see you tomorrow, everybody. Ike, could you stay just a few minutes, please?  Ike, I'm very flattered, by all of your love notes, but I need to be clear. See, there've been a lot of female teachers on the news lately who have been having relationships with young male students and, people might get the wrong idea, even though... I do admire you. You are so smart and gifted. Soo mature for your age.
"
Ike,"I don't like Mason.
"
Teacher,"You listen, and you really care about what I have to say. You make me feel things I've never...  felt before.   Ike, this is crazy. I'm your teacher. How can we be having these feelings for each other?  You're so mysterious, and I can't... and I can't... 
"
REO Speedwagon,"And I can't fight this feelin' anymore
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashin' through your door
Baby, I cant fight this feelin' anymore
"
Teacher,"That was unbelievable. I've never felt like such a woman before. They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't let anybody know; they'll never understand.  We were meant to be, I know it. How else could sex be that incredible? 
"
Ike,"Ike made a nuno.
"
Butters,"Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
"
Cartman,"Hands?! Let me see those hands!
"
Butters,"Haaaah!
"
Cartman,"Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
"
Butters,"It's, it's... I just had it! 
"
Cartman,"I knew it! 
"
Cartman,"Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Cartman,"Here, you need a smoke, brah?
"
Butters,"Uhh, okay. 
"
Cartman,"You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah.
"
Butters,"I do. 
"
Cartman,"Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 
"
Sheila,"Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house.
"
Kyle,"Huh?
"
Sheila,"Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today.
"
Kyle,"What's he doing at his teacher's house?
"
Sheila,"He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
"
Kyle,"Hello?  Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike?  Uh, hello? Is Ike here?  Hello? 
"
Teacher,"OOOH! 
"
Kyle,"Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??
"
Teacher,"Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught.  Hold on, please, you don't understand.
"
Kyle,"Really?! What's there not to understand?!
"
Teacher,"Your brother and I... are in love.
"
Kyle,"He's a little young, don't you think?!
"
Ike,"Oh. 
"
Teacher,"Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it!
"
Ike,"Ring around the rosey.
"
Teacher,"He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle-
"
Kyle,"All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 
"
Ike,"Nonono, nononono.
"
Kyle,"Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
"
Ike,"No, no.
"
Kyle,"Ike?
"
Teacher,"Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?
"
Kyle,"This is nuts.
"
Kyle,"Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 
"
Sheila,"Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
"
Sheila,"That's great.
"
Kyle,"Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
"
Ike,"Spider-Man! I'm safe, Mom.
"
Sheila,"Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?
"
Kyle,"Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
"
Ike,"Weohhh part ten. Mom-my I love you I love you.
"
Sheila,"Mommy loves you too, sweetie.
"
Kyle,"Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
"
Sheila,"Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. 
"
Det. Yates,"You're so full of crap, Foley.
"
Foley,"What? I did shoot him in the face. Twice.
"
Kyle,"Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
"
Yates,"Oh? What's the crime?
"
Kyle,"Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
"
Yates,"Oh my God! This is terrible!  Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?
"
Kyle,"Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
"
Officer 1,"A woman.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. 
"
Officer 2,"Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?
"
Kyle,"Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
"
Yates,"The blonde?
"
Kyle,"Yeah.
"
Officer 1,"Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson?
"
Kyle,"Yes.
"
Officer 1,"Nisssse.
"
Yates,"Nnice.
"
Kyle,"What?! No, you don't understand-
"
Officer 1,"You sure they've had sex?
"
Kyle,"Yeah.
"
Officer 3,"Has she performed oral sex on him?
"
Kyle,"I think so.
"
Officer 3,"...Nice.
"
Officer 1,"Nisssse.
"
Officer 3,"Nisssse.
"
Yates,"So wait, what, what's the crime?
"
Officer 1,"The crime is, she isn't doing it with me. 
"
Kyle,"Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
"
Yates,"You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his ""Luckiest Boy In America"" medal right away. 
"
Kyles,"Gargh!
"
Kyle,"Guys, can I talk to you?
"
Stan,"Sure dude.
"
Kyle,"I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-
"
Cartman,"Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
"
Kyle,"Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
"
Stan,"Dude, what's the matter?
"
Kyle,"The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
"
Stan,"...Wow.
"
Kenny,"(Reaaly??)
"
Cartman,"Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
"
Kyle,"It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
"
Cartman,"What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
"
Kyle,"""stick it inside her and pee""
"
Cartman,"Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
"
Stan,"Dude, I really don't see a problem.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
"
Kyle,"You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
"
Cartman,"They what??
"
Kyle,"They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
"
Cartman,"Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
"
Kyle,"Well they're doing it!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
"
Miss Stevenson,"Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please?  Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you.
"
Ike,"I like dada better.
"
Miss Stevenson,"I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. 
"
Cartman,"Hall infraction! 
"
Miss Stevenson,"Oh uhh, we were just heading back in.
"
Cartman,"You got a hall pass, brah?!
"
Miss Stevenson,"I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
"
Cartman,"Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
"
Miss Stevenson,"Look, just let us get back in-
"
Cartman,"Get down on the floor!
"
Miss Stevenson,"We're going back inside!
"
Cartman,"You like bear mace, icehead?!
"
Miss Stevenson,"Bear mace??
"
Cartman,"You're goin' with Christ! 
"
Miss Stevenson,"Oooooh!
"
Cartman,"...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
"
Principal Victoria,"""Ike, I long to feel your arms around me""?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?
"
Cartman,"Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
"
Principal Victoria,"This is unbelievable.
"
Cartman,"I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
"
Principal Victoria,"Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police.
"
Miss Stevenson,"Oh God...
"
Cartman,"You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!
"
Yates,"Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. 
"
Randy,"What's goin' on?
"
Jimbo,"The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
"
Randy,"With a student? But... she's a woman.
"
Jimbo,"Yeah. I know.
"
Randy,"But... she's hot.
"
Kyle,"Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 
"
Kyle,"Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
"
Ike,"You are dead to me!
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Ike,"I said, you're dead to me!
"
Kyle,"I'm dead to you?
"
Ike,"You're dead to me, Kyle!
"
Miss Stevenson,"I'm at the police station. They say they found some evidence. I'm so scared.  Listen, I want you to know it's okay. If anybody tries to talk to you, you don't need to say anything. Just leave it to me. I know a way out of this.
"
Reporter,"Tom, an elementary school teacher is under arrest for allegedly having an affair... with one of her young students. The case is shocking, due mostly to the fact that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom. If the accusations are true, then... damn! Uh, looks like the defendant and her lawyer are about to give a statement, Tom.
"
Miss Stevenson,"I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students.
"
Man 1,"Nice.
"
Man 2,"Nissse
"
Miss Stevenson,"I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic.
"
Officer 4,"Ohhhh.
"
Miss Stevenson,"Yes, I'm afraid it's true.
"
Cartman,"Oh no!
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Cartman,"I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
"
Miss Stevenson,"I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do.
"
Yates,"Well, that explains it.
"
Officer 1,"Do we still press charges?
"
Yates,"Who are we gonna convict? Johnny Walker?
"
Man 3,"Poor woman. She's a victim.
"
Randy,"Yeah, she's a hot victim. 
"
Lawyer,"My client has agreed to check herself into rehab immediately. 
"
Print Reporter,"Good luck, ma'am. You can beat your alcoholism. 
"
Therapist,"Alcohol is a crutch which we use to medicate ourselves; to, to cover up emotional baggage from our past. Was there ever a history of sexual abuse in your family?
"
Miss Stevenson,"No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to loss and he'd take pictures.
"
Therapist,"Nissse.  Congratulations, Miss Stevenson.
"
Miss Stevenson,"All better now. 
"
Miss Stevenson,"Ike. 
"
Ike,"Miss Stephenson 
"
Miss Stevenson,"Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about. 
"
Ike,"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay, Mulan!
"
Miss Stevenson,"Get your things together. We don't have much time.
"
Kyle,"Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike! 
"
Yates,"Are you sure you're not lying, Foley?
"
Foley,"No, really! I shot both of them! They weren't even doin' nothin'!
"
Sheila,"Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!
"
Yates,"You're kidding!
"
Sheila,"No, it's true!
"
Yates,"Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!
"
Sheila,"This is serious!
"
Officer 3,"Yeah, boys going to Milan with a beautiful older woman. Quick! Call the FBI! 
"
Sheila,"Are you going to do nothing?!
"
Yates,"All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus...
"
Cartman,"There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
"
Kyle,"Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do.
"
Cartman,"No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
"
Kyle,"How do you know that?
"
Cartman,"I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
"
Kyle,"Who's Beth?
"
Cartman,"Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
"
Cartman,"I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?
"
Butters,"Ehthat was pretty good.
"
Kyle,"Can we get going now, please?!
"
Cartman,"Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! 
"
Miss Stevenson,"Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?
"
Ike,"I love TV. Yaaay!
"
Miss Stevenson,"But what about me? I want to talk. 
"
Cartman,"Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
"
Leeroy,"She ran away; now she got to deal with the Dawg, huh?
"
Cartman,"Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out! 
"
Bellboy,"Hey! You can't leave your car there!
"
Cartman,"It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
"
Receptionist,"Can I help you?
"
Cartman,"You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!
"
Receptionist,"Who are you?
"
Cartman,"I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
"
Head Concierge,"I think you should leave before I call the police!
"
Cartman,"Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
"
Bellboy,"We need police here, right away! 
"
Guest 1,"Yes?
"
Cartman,"I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
"
Guest 2,"Do you mind keepin' it down?
"
Cartman,"Keep your mouth shut, brah!!
"
Miss Stevenson,"Oh no! Ike!  They're on to us!
"
Ike,"Oh no!
"
Miss Stevenson,"Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!
"
Officers,"What have we got? What have we got?!
"
Officer 5,"Who called 911?!
"
Receptionist,"They went that way.  Look out! They have bear mace!
"
Leeroy,"Open up! I'm with the Dawg! 
"
Kyle,"Oh crap! 
"
Officer 6,"You freeze right there! 
"
Miss Stevenson,"Come on, darling! 
"
Earl,"Hey!  Uh I got 'em, Dawg. 10-4!
"
Cartman,"Praise Christ! Let's go! 
"
Miss Stevenson,"Ike, run! 
"
Cartman,"Bear mace that guy! And that guy! 
"
Cartman,"Freeze, bitch!
"
Officer 7,"Freeze!
"
Officer 8,"Hands up! Hands up!
"
Officer 9,"Don't move! Don't move!
"
Cartman,"It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
"
Officer 10,"Hey, that is the teacher we just got the report about. 
"
Officer 7,"All right, Miss Stevenson, you got nowhere to go!
"
Miss Stevenson,"Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
"
Cartman,"Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!
"
Leeroy,"She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh?
"
Miss Stevenson,"It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan. 
"
Officer 7,"Now hold on, don't do anything foolish! We can talk about this!
"
Miss Stevenson,"You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.
"
Kyle,"No! Ike, don't do it!
"
Ike,"I don deser futty bad man.
"
Kyle,"Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. 
"
Miss Stevenson,"You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
"
Kyle,"Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 
"
Miss Stevenson,"I'm afraid you're too late.  Are you ready, my love?  Here we go! One, two, three, aaaahhh!  Ike?? 
"
Ike,"Yaaaay!
"
Kyle,"Ike!
"
Cartman,"Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
"
Officer 8,"Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now.
"
Cartman,"That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. 
"
Satan,"Halloween is a night for evil. It is time for me to take what is mine.
"
Demon 1,"What do you plan, Lord Satan?
"
Satan,"On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!
"
Demon 2,"How big a party are we talking?
"
Satan,"Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties? That big.
"
Demon 2,"Satan, we can't possibly do-
"
Satan,"SILENCE!  Halloween is about me! And I deserve a par-ty! This... shall be MY Super Sweet 16!!  Minions of Hell! The time has come for us to rise! For my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!!  I got Bacardi, and Ghetto One to sponsor the party, and I'm calling it  Hell On Earth 2006!  But now, heed my words: in order to get in to the party, you have to RSVP and get a blue wristband. Everyone is gonna try and get into this party, so if you don't get your wristband in advance, or you're not wearing that wristband at the door, you're NOT GETTING IN!!  And NOW know this: It's a costume party, so you have to wear a costume. BUT... nobody better show up as The Crow! I'm serious. Every costume party there's like fourteen guys come dressed like the Crow 'cause they wanna look hot and hook up. It's lame! If you come dressed as the Crow, you're NOT GETTING IN to the party!!  Go now and prepare!! If you miss my party you are a looozer!! 
"
George Burns,"Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth.
"
Ghandi,"I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel.
"
Princess Diana,"This is going to be the best Halloween ever. 
"
Stan,"Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
"
Kyle,"I am doing it.
"
Tweek,"No! Don't do it!
"
Cartman,"What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
"
Kyle,"Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...
"
Cartman,"See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 
"
Kyle,"Fine!  Then YOU do it, you're so tough!
"
Cartman,"I've done it lots of times.
"
Kyle,"Prove it!
"
Cartman,"Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
"
Kyle,"You're afraid to do it, too.
"
Cartman,"I am not!
"
Butters,"Then do it, if you're not yellow! 
"
Cartman,"Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... 
"
Jimmy,"Hey fellas.  You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza.
"
The other boys,"Let's go. Yeah, let's go!
"
Cartman,"Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
"
Demon 1,"Satan, I must speak with thee.
"
Satan,"What is it?
"
Demon 1,"You've invited so many celebrities on Earth to your party that people in Hell can't get wristbands.
"
Satan,"Well I have to invite celebrities or else my party won't be cool.
"
Demon 1,"Satan, I warn thee, do not throw this party at the cost of alienating your friends.
"
Satan,"I'm not alienating my friends! I know they come first!
"
Demon 1,"I hope for your sake that's true. You've never thrown a party of this magnitude before, Satan. Be wary. 
"
Cardinal Mahoney,"Halloween has always been a time of evil and darkness. But now it appears that Satan will literally be among us. He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles, and from what we understand, the gathering is going to be... completely off the hook.  There's more: None of us... are invited. 
"
Bishop 1,"None?
"
Bishop 2,"Satan mocks us.
"
Bishop 3,"His party must be stopped.
"
Priest 1,"Yes, we cannot let evil take over our city, even for a night. 
"
Priest 2,"What can we do? 
"
Resident Bishop,"Tomorrow night, after all of Satan's guests have arrived, we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there. We'll see how long Satan's party lasts... after the fire marshal shows up.
"
Butters,"That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  
"
Biggie Smalls,"What the fuck is THIS?!
"
Butters,"AAAAH! 
"
Biggie Smalls,"Hey! 
"
Butters,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
Stephen,"Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!
"
Butters,"I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!
"
Stephen,"You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!
"
Butters,"But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
"
Stephen,"Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!
"
Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
Stephen,"...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?
"
Satan,"So I want the DJ to set up over here, and then the main dance floor area can be this whole area right here.
"
Male Staffer,"What about valets? Ha, how will people be arriving from Hell?
"
Satan,"Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy, they won't have cars.
"
Female Staffer,"Buut we're probably gonna want security at the dimensional vortex gate.
"
Satan,"I want all the servers dressed in skimpy outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres.
"
Demon 1,"This is getting really expensive.
"
Satan,"Shut up, it's Halloween! This is my night! Then at midnight, for dessert, I'm thinking over here, we bring out a huuuge chocolate fondue fountain.
"
Male Staffer,"Oh yeah, P Diddy had his birthday party here a couple years back and he had one of those.
"
Satan,"Oh, screw that, then. I don't want a fondue fountain if P Diddy had one.
"
Demon 1,"Does it matter?!
"
Satan,"Yes it matters! I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it!
"
Demon 1,"How about a doughnut machine?
"
Satan,"Did Diddy do it?
"
Male Staffer,"Diddy did do it.
"
Satan,"A full ice cream bar!
"
Male Staffer,"Diddy did it.
"
Satan,"Damnit, what didn't Diddy do?!  Wait. I know.  Yes. It's perfect. At midnight, all the lights go down. The music stops. And then we wheel in... a Ferrari. Only it isn't a Ferrari... It's a cake. And everyone gets a piece.
"
Demon 1,"A Ferrari cake?
"
Male Staffer,"Diddy didn't do it.
"
Demon 1,"Satan, really, the logistics of getting a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time-
"
Satan,"This party has to be the bomb! Don't you get it?!  When everyone sees the Ferrari cake,  they will shudder and know my greatness!
"
Demon 3,"Hear me, demons! Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake! Now I will take charge of Halloween, and call upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls! Ted Bundy!  Jeffrey Dahmer!  And John Wayne Gacy!  You shall rise once again to walk the earth, for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you... to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake, and deliver it to the W Hotel!
"
Bundy,"No problem.
"
Dahmer,"We can handle it.
"
Demon 3,"Heed my words: Satan's entire Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake. Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!
"
Smalls,"You punkass fool!
"
Butters,"Haaaah.
"
Smalls,"Why'd you summon me?
"
Butters,"P-please don't ice me, homie?
"
Smalls,"You'd better have a good reason, sucka!
"
Butters,"I just... w-was seein' if it works.
"

Butters,"Oh hamburgers!

Demon 1,"Yes. Yes, Satan. Your Halloween costume turned out perfect.
"
Satan,"Yeah, it's okay, but everyone thinks Zazul's schoolgirl costume is hotter.
"
Zazul,"Ehhhhhhh.
"
Satan,"Zazul, switch costumes with me.
"
Demon 1,"Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume.
"
Satan,"Nobody can look hotter than me! It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party! Take it off, Zazul.  And what about my Ferrari cake?! Where's the Ferrari cake?!
"
Demon 1,"Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery.
"
Bundy,"All right, this is the place. Now remember, you numbskulls, this Ferrari cake is really important for Satan's party, so don't louse it up!
"
Dahmer,"Who's lousing?
"
Bundy,"Come 'ere.  Shut up! 
"
Head Baker,"Can I help you?
"
Bundy,"We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake.
"
Head Baker,"Ohhh yes, it's just about finished. What kind of truck are we loading it up to?
"
Bundy,"We got that flatbed. 
"
Head Baker,"Okay well, we're just gonna need to- GYAAAH!

"
Dahmer,"He startled me.

Gacy,"I'm a victim of circumstance. 
"
Bundy,"Ahh, who're you hittin'?

Gacy,"Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk.  Oh!
"
Bundy,"Get outta here.  Be quiet.  You idiots! Now who's gonna help us load the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed?!
"
Officer,"Did your son say anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?
"
Linda,"He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... 
"
Cartman,"Dude...
"
Jimmy,"Du... du... dude.
"
Stan,"Dad! Dad!
"
Randy,"What?
"
Stan,"If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
"
Randy,"Biggie Smalls?
"
Cartman,"You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues
"
Randy,"All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror.
"
Cartman,"How do you know??
"
Randy,"I'm a geologist! 
"
Kyle,"He's right. It's just a spook story.
"
Tweek,"Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
"
Kyle,"I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
"
Cartman,"How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
"
Butters,"I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-
"
Smalls,"Yo dawg, keep it down.
"
Butters,"Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
"
Smalls,"Oh no! YOU summoned my spirit, YOU're gettin' me all the way to the party! As long as I get to the party in time to party, everything'll be all right.  Hey! 
"
Kyle,"...Smalls. 
"
Smalls,"Oh, God-damnit! 
"
Stan,"It does work!!
"
Kyle,"Holy crap!!
"
Smalls,"That's it! Now I'm pissed! 
"
George Burns,"Hehey, everybody. Check out Hitler.  He's the ""Can you hear me now?"" guy. 
"
Hitler,"Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? 
"
Satan,"Everyone quiet! Here he is, the man of the night, SATAN!  Get out of the way, Hitler! You're ruining my entrance! Gaau!
"
Cardinal Mahoney,"Yes, hello? It this the fire department?  Wait, shh, shh, shh.  I need to make a complaint to the fire marshal.  He's what? Where?  Damn your evil heart, Satan!!
"
Resident Bishop,"What?
"
Cardinal Mahoney,"The Fire Marshal is at the party! Satan invited him!
Priest:
"" Satan's trickery knows no bounds! ""
Cardinal Mahoney:
"" That's it! One way or another, we're crashing this party! ""
"
Satan,"This is VIP. Don't just let anybody into my VIP area, okay? 
"
Frank Sinatra,"Hey, Satan, you got a little problem.
"
Satan,"What?
"
Frank Sinatra,"Somebody showed up in a Crocodile Hunter costume. It's really offending some of the other guests.
"
Satan,"Oh jeez.  Hey, uh, hi, listen, dude, ya know, the whole Crocodile Hunter thing? It... it's just a little soon, you know? I mean, he just dies a few weeks ago and... it's just not supercool and you gotta leave.
"
Steve Irwin,"But it's me, Satan. Steve Irwin. I am the Crocodile Hunter.
"
Satan,"Oh... oh, but then, dude, no costume. Sorry, you gotta go. 
"
Steve Irwin,"Wait! I thought we were friends!
"
Satan,"Oh hey, Sinatra! 
"
Male Staffer,"Demonius!  Demonius, we have a problem!
"
Demonius,"What is it?
"
Male Staffer,"The Ferrari cake! It isn't here!
"
Demonius,"What?? Don't even tell me that!
"
Male Staffer,"It was never delivered to the hotel.
"
Demonius,"Deva! Fetch my Blackberry! That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight! 
"
Man,"Do you gentlemen need a hand? 
"
Bundy,"Gacy!  Whatcha do that foor?!
"
Gacy,"I did it for Dahmer.
"
Bundy,"For Dahmer?
"
Gacy,"Yeah. He likes havin' sex with dead bodies. 
"
Bundy,"Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!
"
Dahmer,"What good are intestines if you can't have sex with them?
"
Bundy,"We gotta get rid of this body before anyone sees it!  Now get those to the trashcan!  Stop eating that! 
"
Gacy,"Leave him alone!  Unh!
"
Bundy,"Cut it!  Come 'ere, ya. 
"
"Dahmer, Gacy","Oh! 
"
Dahmer,"There.  Oh.  The cake! 
"
Bundy,"Oh no!
"
Gacy,"Mmm, Ferrari.
"
Bundy,"What's the matter with you?! It's ruined!
"
Dahmer,"We're gonna get it now.
"
A guest,"This is a really extravagant party, Satan.
"
Satan,"I know, but just wait till midnight. You are not gonna believe what's coming for desert! 
"
Black Bouncer,"Uh, these aren't the right wristbands.
"
A Bishop,"Uh, yes they are.
"
White Bouncer,"Then how come they say ""Knott's Berry Farm""? 
"
Cardinal Mahoney,"In the name of Christ, just let us in!
"
Stan,"We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.
"
Smalls,"Not as sorry as you're gonna be, if I completely miss the party!
"
Ticket agent,"Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles boarding in 10 minutes.
"
Kyle,"See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
"
Smalls,"Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss-  What the? No! No!
"
Randy,"...Smalls.  No way!
"
Smalls,"Motherfucking God-damnit!
"
Randy,"That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!
"
Smalls,"Cool this, sucka! 
"
Bundy,"All right, listen you mugs! It's now 11:30. That means we only have twenty minutes to bake a new Ferrari cake.
"
Dahmer,"No problem! It just so happens that I went to an Italian cooking school.
"
Bundy,"Yeah? Why'd you quit?
"
Dahmer,"There weren't enough Italians to eat. 
"
Gacy,"Nyak nyak nyak nyak nya-eh  Nyaaa nyaaaa
"
Bundy,"Get over here!  All right, what's the recipe call for first?
"
Dahmer,"Ten thousand eggs.
"
Bundy,"Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs.
"
Gacy,"You get 'em!
"
Bundy,"Shut up!
"
Gacy,"Nyaaaaa! 
"
Bundy,"Oh! Ohh, wise guy, ey? 
"
Gacy,"GAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
Bundy,"How's that?
"
Dahmer,"Hey! Leave him alone! 
"
Bundy,"AAA!
"
Dahmer,"Nehhh!
"
Bundy,"Try that again!
"
Dahmer,"Nehhh! 
"
Gacy,"What happened??
"
Bundy,"Shut up! 
"
Cowboy,"He can't do it, he can't do it.
"
John Elway,"All right, be quiet.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Oh I can't do it! I'm too freaked out. 
"
Male Staffer,"What do we do?? It's midnight. The Ferrari cake never arrived!
"
Zazul,"This is terrible!
"
Demonius,"It's okay! It's okay!  I found a backup! Go ahead and start the ceremony! 
"
Zazul,"Your attention please: It is now midnight! Time for Satan's special surprise. 
"
A Guest,"I wonder what this is going to be.
"
Satan,"Just you wait.  Yes. Here it comes. 
"
Zazul,"Ladies and gentlemen: a fully edible Acura cake! 
"
Satan,"Acura?? But I wanted a Ferrari! 
"
Demonius,"We did the best we could; there was a problem.
"
Zazul,"Acuras are really nice.
"
Satan,"IT'S NOT THE CAR I WANTED! THE WHOLE PARTY'S RUINED! 
"
Demonius,"It doesn't matter. Your guests are having fun. They don't care.
"
Satan,"IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM, IT'S ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEE!!! 
"
Frank Sinatra,"Wow, what a jerk.
"
A Cowboy,"Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell. I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake.
"
Satan,"Oh God, what's happened to me? I've never been this terrible before. By trying to have a party like those spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV, I've become like one of them.
"
Zazul,"Satan, don't be so hard on yourself. You're not as bad as they are.
"
Satan,"But I am. Throwing people out, making a big entrance, having these stupid pictures of me all over. Halloween is supposed to be for everyone. Everybody, I'm sorry. This party is for you. It's for all of you who make my life so special. If I don't realize that, then I'm no better than a rich American teenage girl.  Open the doors! Let everyone in, wristband or no! 
"
Butters,"Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 
"
Smalls,"What the-?
"
Butters,"Thanks. 
"
Smalls,"I am soo sick of this! Wait, I'm at the party.
"
Butters,"Sure, homie. I got your back, yo.
"
Smalls,"And it's not too late. Hey, why don't you come in with me?
"
Butters,"Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. 
"
Cartman,"Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 
"
Liane,"There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?
"
Cartman,"I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
"
Liane,"When does it come out?
"
Cartman,"Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
"
Liane,"It's time for school
"
Cartman,"No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand.
"
Liane,"Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. 
"
Cartman,"Noo!! Nooo!!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Principal Victoria, it is wrong!  It is wrong and I simply will not do it!  I care about my students, and I will not fill their heads with lies!  I am NOT teaching evolution in my class!! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!
"
Mr. Mackey,"M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff!
"
Principal Victoria,"Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything.
"
Cartman,"How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
"
Stan,"It's still three weeks.
"
Cartman,"Oh God...  Okay, how long now?
"
Kyle,"Will you shut up already?! 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution.
"
Butters,"Oh boy!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP. But I've been told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this:  In the beginning we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its  mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this.  retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you!  So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!
"
Cartman,"HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.
"
Cartman,"Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! 
"
Clerk,"Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. 
"
Liane,"Eric, you're coming home right now!
"
Cartman,"Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
"
Liane,"It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
"
Cartman,"Oh God!
"
Cartman,"Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
"
Cartman,"You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
"
Stan,"Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
"
Kyle,"Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
"
Cartman,"No. There is something I can do.
"
Kenny,"(What?)
"
Cartman,"All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.
"
Stan,"Do what?
"
Cartman,"Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
"
Kyle,"No.
"
Cartman,"It's simple science, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"You'll die, retard!
"
Cartman,"I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
"
Stan,"Dude, no way.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you.
"
Cartman,"I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! 
"
Father,"Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!
"
Mrs. Garrsion,"I told you this would happen, didn't I?!
"
Principal Victoria,"Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-
"
Mr. Triscotti,"We have worked years to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter, and in one fell swoop, you try to destroy everything we did!
"
Mrs. Garrsion,"I hear ya.
"
Principal Victoria,"Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class.
"
Mr. Triscotti,"You most certainly will!
"
Daughter,"But Dad, I want to learn everything.
"
Mr. Triscotti,"No you don't! Shut up! 
"
Mrs. Garrsion,"Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms.
"
Principal Victoria,"It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! 
"
Mrs. Garrsion,"Re-replaced??
"
Principal Victoria,"Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Charmed to meet you. Ms...
"
Mrs. Garrsion,"Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class!
"
Principal Victoria,"You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Whatever.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Retarded fish-frogs.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Well, you're a faggot!  Continue.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Well yes, basically, we are.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"I never covered it up.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well act like a monkey, huh?! 
"
Mr. Dawkins,"What on earth are you doing?? 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!! 
"
Mr. Dawkins,"AAAH!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements.
"
Principal Victoria,"Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What??
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students.
"
Principal Victoria,"Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What?!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"You d-you do?
"
Mr. Dawkins,"I've never met a woman with so much... fire
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Well I...  I do bring down a woman's wrath now and again. 
"
Mr. Dawkins,"So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful.  I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-
"
Mrs. Garrison,"No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Well,  well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation!  Oh boy, what'll I wear?!  Hey everybody!
"
Cartman,"Ey!
"
Liane,"Whoa!
"
Cartman,"Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!
"
Liane,"Eric, get out of there. 
"
Cartman,"No! No, it's too soon!
"
Liane,"Now Eric, this has gone far enough!  You need to learn to be patient!
"
Cartman,"Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
"
Butters,"Go where?
"
Cartman,"You're gonna help me freeze myself.
"
Butters,"Okay. 
"
Butters,"Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
"
Cartman,"Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
"
Butters,"Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?
"
Cartman,"No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea
"
Butters,"Yeah...I guess it is...
"
Cartman,"All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?
"
Butters,"I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.
"
Cartman,"All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
"
Butters,"Oh jeez! 
"
Cartman,"Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"So I told my gynecologist, ""you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!"" 
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Hehyeah, almost.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"You're riiight. It's so simple! God is a spaghetti monster. Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened!  Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Really?? Oh that's wonderful!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"You're so welcome!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Would you like tuh...  head over to my place for dessert?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Oh Ms. Garrison!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!
"
Cartman,"Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
"
Medic,"We have a pulse. 
"
Alien 1,"Can you... understand me?
"
Cartman,"Where am I?
"
Shvek,"My name is Shvek. You are safe.
"
Cartman,"Safe where, butthole?!
"
Shvek,"My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546.
"
Cartman,"What??
"
Shvek,"You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years.  Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! 
"
Medic,"Please be careful. You are frail.
"
Cartman,"Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
"
Analyst,"Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time.
"
Cartman,"Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
"
Medic,"Young man, you don't seem to understand.  Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years.
"
Cartman,"I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
"
Shvek,"We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
"
Cartman,"No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"That's my man.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-
"
Stan,"Well there could still be a god.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What?!
"
Stan,"Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Uh oh, retard alert! Retard alert, class!  Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!
"
Stan,"I wasn't talking about spaghetti. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair! 
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Yes, but to be so bold about it...  I've just never seen a woman with such... balls.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Oh, all right. 
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!! 
"
Butters,"Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!
"
Dougie,"Pehpew Pehpew! 
"
Butters,"Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
"
Linda,"Butters?  Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?
"
Butters,"Who, me?
"
Linda,"It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?
"
Butters,"No ma'am.
"
Linda,"Okay. 
"
Dougie,"Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! 
"
Butters,"Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?
"
Dougie,"Okay.
"
Butters,"Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
"
Dougie,"...Yeah.
"
Butters,"Well, like what?
"
Dougie,"...Like, you die.
"
Butters,"...Die??
"
Dougie,"Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead.
"
Butters,"Oh hamburgers!! 
"
Butters,"Eric! Erihic!
"
Dougie,"You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
"
Butters,"He told me to!
"
Dougie,"He's dead for sure.
"
Butters,"Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
"
Dougie,"Oh my God...
"
Butters,"Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!
"
Dougie,"Butters ButterButterBUTTERS!  We have to get out of here!
"
Butters,"What??
"
Dougie,"Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! 
"
Butters,"But I just did what he told me!
"
Dougie,"Come on, we have to leave!!
"
Butters,"Oh jumping Jesus! 
"
Cartman,"This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. 
"
Shvek,"Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii.
"
Cartman,"What??  Really??  YES!! YES!!
"
Medic,"It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.
"
Cartman,"So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
"
Shvek,"Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first.
"
Shvek,"You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason.
"
Medic,"Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.
"
Cartman,"I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
"
Shvek,"You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist.
"
Cartman,"And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
"
Medic,"We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.
"
Cartman,"Who? 
"
Shvek,"What in Science's name was that?! 
"
Medic,"Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!
"
Shvek,"Oh Science, help us! 
"
UAA Member 1,"Science damn you, Unified Atheist League!
"
Cartman,"Who are they??
"
Shvek,"The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them. 
"
UAL Member 1,"No! 
"
Cartman,"Jesus Christ!
"
Shvek,"Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being.  Oh my Science. 
"
Cartman,"I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
"
UAA Member 1,"Put me through to the Allied Atheist Allegiance!
"
UAA Member 2,"Onscreen.
"
UAA Member 1,"Look, Allied Atheist Allegiance! We have the time child!
"
AAA Leader,"Science damn you, United Atheist Alliance!
"
UAA Member 1,"Now you see, foolish sea otters, that we are the atheists in control!
"
AAA Leader,"It won't make a difference! This is the dawning of the sea otter! Know this, time child! I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!
"
Cartman,"What??
"
AAA Leader,"Otters! The time has come! Sound the nafferty!
"
Sea Otters,"The nafferty! 
"
AAA Leader,"So, it begins!
"
Narrator,"The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years.
"
Otter Leader,"Whoa, steady!  This way, otters! 
"
Otter 1,"This is it. New New Hampshire. We have risked much bringing you here, Time Child. 
"
Cartman,"Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
"
Otter 1,"Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run.
"
Cartman,"We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot. 
"
Otter Leader,"Something is spooking the ostriches.
"
Cartman,"Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
"
Otter Leader,"Here it is! We have arrived.
"
Blavius,"Hold!  This is it, Time Child.  The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here.
"
Cartman,"Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 
"
Blavius,"All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay.
"
Cartman,"Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. 
"
Blavius,"NOOOO!
"
Otter Leader,"It was a trick!
"
Blavius,"SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!
"
Cartman,"I got it! I got the Wii!
"
UAA Leader,"Time Child! You've returned!
"
UAA 1,"We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant.
"
Cartman,"Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 
"
UAA Leader,"TC, wait!
"
Cartman,"Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!
"
UAA Leader,"You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?!
"
Cartman,"Here. 
"
UAA 1,"Science be praised. This could end the war!
"
UAA Leader,"You've done a great thing, TC.  How can we repay you?
"
Cartman,"Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 
"
Cartman,"Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
"
Maintenance Guy,"Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your flaot screen.
"
Cartman,"There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
"
Maintenance Guy,"It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output.
"
Cartman,"You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 
"
UAA Woman,"TC? What's wrong?
"
Cartman,"I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!
"
UAA Woman,"Well, we're all glad you're back. I know somebody who's missed you very much. Come on in, K-10. 
"
K-10,"Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you.
"
Cartman,"Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
"
UAA Leader,"Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply!
"
UAA 2,"But, those are civilian otters.
"
UAA Leader,"We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours.
"
UAA 3,"Yes, but... sending out all our ships at the same time... it would leave our city exposed!
"
UAA Leader,"...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.
"
UAL 1,"The United Atheist Alliance is about to send out all its defense ships to take down the Allied Atheist Allieance's clam fields.
"
UAL 2,"Praise Science. This is your chance, young Shvek, to avenge your father's death.
"
UAL 3,"Careful, son. Just because their Science leads them to a different answer to the Great Question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all.
"
Shvek,"No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great.  Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago.  Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future.  But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough. You have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you.  Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!
"
Announcer,"With new Glade monvert cleaner, you can make your monvert sparkle like never before.
"
Woman,"My monvert's never looked so clean. 
"
Cartman,"God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! 
"
Boy 1,"Agh! I'm so bored.
"
Boy 2,"There's nothing to do.
"
Cartman,"Tell me about it.
"
Boy 3,"Hey, I know! Let's crank call people in the past!
"
Boy 1,"Huh?
"
Boy 3,"I just got...  the Crank Prank Time Phone! 
"
Singers,"Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
"
Announcer,"New, from Blasbro, it's Crank Prank Time Phone!
"
Boy Announcer,"I just dial a random number on the keypad, enter a date and year on the debilibrator, and...
"
Boy 1,"Wow! Someone from the past is on the line!  Hello? Is there a refrigierator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it! 
"
Singers,"Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone.
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Boy 2,"Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right? Could I speak to Al Coholic, please? 
"
Announcer,"Crank Prank Time Phone comes with debilibrator , antimatter fusion cone, andn 30 plain HF watt triggers. Warning: Crank Prank Time Phone is for entertainment purposes only. Makng anything OTHER than crank calls to the past could affect the present and end your existence. Crank Prank Time Phone is not intended for the use by otters.
"
Cartman,"Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
"
K-10,"Why does it matter? Bark bark
"
Cartman,"Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
"
K-10,"Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal.
"
Cartman,"I care! Where's the closest toy store??
"
K-10,"Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping comples. But it is not open yet.
"
Cartman,"Come on! Come on!
"
Voice,"Store is now... open.  Welcome
"
Cartman,"Ugh, finally!
"
Clerk,"Welcome to Zeebod's Toys
"
Cartman,"I want one of those time-phone things.
"
Clerk,"Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?
"
Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
"
Clerk,"All right, that'll be 6000 credits. 
"
Cartman,"Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
"
Clerk,"This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
"
Cartman,"Look, I have to have one of those phones!
"
Clerk,"Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. 
"
K-10,"Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark.
"
Cartman,"How about a robot? How much for the robot?
"
K-10,"Awww.
"
Clerk,"Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present.
"
Cartman,"Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
"
K-10,"Working, bark bark. Access.
"
Cartman,"I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
"
K-10,"Working, bark bark.
"
Blavius,"The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail!
"
Otters,"Hail Science! Hail Science! Hail Science!
"
Blavius,"And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!
"
Man,"I'll get it, darling.  Hello? Hello?
"
Boy 4,"Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall?
"
Man,"I;m sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here.
"
Boy 4,"Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there?
"
Man,"Nno, there are no Walls here.
"
Boy 4,"Then how does your roof stay up? 
"
Man,"Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson boys from down the street?!
"
Boy 4,"No, we're from the future. 
"
Man,"Very funny!
"
Boy 5,"Hi, uh, I'm a Pepper, and I'm wondering if you'd like to be a Pepper too?
"
Man,"God darn ya! 
"
Boy 4,"Yeah.
"
Boy 5,"That was a great one! 
"
Cartman,"Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
"
Boy 4,"Oh. Okay, I guess.
"
Cartman,"Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... 
"
Boy 5,"Hey!
"
Cartman,"Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 
"
Boy 4,"Science H. Logic! What a jerk!
"
The Wise One,"Silence, otters!
"
Otter 1,"It's the Wise One
"
Otter 2,"The Wise One speaks.
"
The Wise One,"This is not the path we should be taking. Will more bloodshed end anything?
"
Blavius,"Wise One, our answer to the Great Question is the only one based on good science.
"
The Wise One,"Science, reason, is that really all there is?
"
Blavius,"They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!
"
Otter Leader,"Yes!  The great Dawkins said we cannot tolerate those who don't use reason! How reasonable is it to eat off wood instead of your tummy?
"
The Wise One,"Well perhaps the great Dawkins wasn't so wise. Oh, he was intelligent, but, some of the most intelligent otters I've ever known were completely lacking in common sense. Maybe, some otters do need to believe in something. Who knows? Maybe, just believing in God makes God exist.
"
Otter Soldier,"Kill the Wise One!
"
Otter 3,"Kill the Wise One! 
"
The Wise One,"Whoa, wait wait! 
"
Cartman,"Oh God!  Hello? 
"
Time Child,"Hello?  Are you there?
"
Cartman,"Who is this?
"
Time Child,"No, no, I have me.  All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient!
"
Cartman,"What?? Who the hell is this?!
"
Time Child,"It's me.
"
Cartman,"Me who?!
"
Time Child,"Me you!
"
Cartman,"What?!
"
Time Child,"I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!
"
Cartman,"Oh very funny, Kyle!
"
Time Child,"It's not Kyle, it's you!
"
Cartman,"Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
"
Time Child,"I'm trying to do you a favor, dumbass!! Just listen to me!
"
Cartman,"Listen to this!  Dickhead. 
"
Time Child,"What an asshole!
"
Butters,"Hello? 
"
Time Child,"Butters? Butters!
"
Butters,"Eric? Iiis that you?
"
Time Child,"Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!
"
Butters,"Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
"
Time Child,"No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!
"
Butters,"But...  but you're here right now. 
"
Cartman,"Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
"
Time Child,"No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself!
"
Butters,"Huh??
"
Cartman,"Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!
"
Butters,"But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
"
Cartman,"What??  Who the fuck is this?!
"
Time Child,"Aw damnit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!
"
Cartman,"Suck my balls!
"
Time Child,"No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!
"
Cartman,"...Okay, you have one minute.
"
Time Child,"Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?
"
Cartman,"Are you spying on me?!
"
Time Child,"No, I am you, you stupid asshole!
"
Cartman,"Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!
"
Butters,"Oh, all right then.
"
Time Child,"God I hate that guy!!
"
UAA Leader,"My friends, the time has come! May Science give us the courage to do what we must! Launch all defensive ships to sector J7! Take out the otters' clam fields! 
"
UAL Aide,"Sir! The United Atheist Alliance has sent out all their ships. Their capital is now unprotected.
"
UAL Leader,"Then begin the attack! Science be praised.
"
Otter Leader,"Kill the table-eaters! In the name of Almighty Science! 
"
Kyle,"Hello? 
"
Time Child,"Hello? Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Hello?
"
Time Child,"Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?
"
Kyle,"What do you want?!
"
Time Child,"Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?
"
Kyle,"I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
"
Time Child,"No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It it backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future.
"
Kyle,"... Uh huh.
"
Time Child,"No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog. 
"
K-10,"Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark.
"
Kyle,"... I'm hanging up now.
"
Time Child,"No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer.
"
Kyle,"Suck my balls, fatass.
"
Time Child,"... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle. 
"
Kyle,"Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 
"
Time Child,"Kyle?  Kyle!
"
KIT-9,"Eric, I really think you should stop calling the past. You could change the present.
"
Time Child,"Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?
"
KIT-9,"I guess not, meow meow.
"
Time Child,"Hm, I see...  Hey!
"
KIT-9,"Meow meow. 
"
Time Child,"Heeeeey!
"
KIT-9,"Meow meow.
"
UAA Woman,"TC! We're under attack!
"
Time Child,"By who?!
"
UAA Woman,"We have to get to the War Room! It's the only safe place!
"
UAA Leader,"The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless!
"
Cartman,"This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
"
Tactical Officer,"Sir! The sea otters are advancing! They've broken through the east portal!
"
UAA Leader,"What?! Three-way phone channel onscreen! 
"
Shvek,"What are you otters doing?! This is our attack!
"
Blavius,"Yes. And we're attacking both of you!
"
UAA Leader,"You fools! This will be the end of us all!
"
Blavius,"Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw.
"
UAA Leader,"Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!
"
Cartman,"What is the Great Question?
"
KIT-9,"What atheists should call themselves.
"
Shvek,"Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.
"
UAA Leader,"&gt;Unified Atheist Allianace makes more sense.
"
Blavius,"No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!
"
Shvek,"So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.
"
Tactical Officer,"Forward missiles launched, sir!
"
Cartman,"I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
"
KIT-9,"But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in history.
"
Cartman,"Who?
"
KIT-9,"Your teacher, the one called Garrison.
"
Cartman,"Garrison? But he's an asshole.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Oh Ms. Garrison!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Damnit, who the hell is calling?!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"I'll thell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah...  Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?
"
Cartman,"It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"An emergency?
"
Cartman,"I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment.
"
Cartman,"Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Sex-change operation??
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Uh oh.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Uuuuugh! You're a man?!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Not anymore. I've been fixed.  Richard, hold on. I can explain.
"
Mr. Dawkins,"Explain?? How can I be so stupid?? 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Richard, come back, please!  Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!
"
Cartman,"Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! 
"
Shvek,"All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?
"
Cartman,"Go... Right... Where am I going? 
"
UAA Leader,"W-we told you: we're sending you home. With the Crank and Wank Time Machine.
"
Blavius,"Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen.
"
Cartman,"Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
"
Shvek,"Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.
"
Medic,"Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence.
"
Cartman,"So there is no war now in the future.
"
Blavius,"Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.
"
All,"Yeah!
"
UAA Leader,"But now the moment has come to send you back to your time. 
"
Shvek,"We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled.
"
Cartman,"And what was that purpose again?
"
Shvek,"We explained that to you already.
"
Cartman,"Right... 
"
COCKA-3,"Goodbye, Eric. I will mess you. Squawk squawk
"
Cartman,"I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
"
UAA Leader,"So long, Eric. And tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer. 
"
Cartman,"Noooo!  I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
"
Liane,"There you are, Eric.
"
Cartman,"Mom! Mom, they did it!
"
Liane,"Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out.
"
Cartman,"No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
"
Liane,"But, honey, it's only September. That...  Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months.
"
Cartman,"What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
"
Liane,"Who are you talking to, muffin?
"
Cartman,"I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!
"
Clerk,"Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you.
"
Cartman,"Hello?
"
Time Child,"Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!
"
Cartman,"...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! 
"
Editor,"Being a delivery boy for the South Park Gazette is a noble privilege.
"
Stan,"I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
"
Mr. Jarvis,"Oh waaa waaa waaa! We've all got problems, pussy! Get used to it!  You aren't delivering the papers on time!
"
Stan,"My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 
"
Mr. Jarvis,"Is that your bike out there? 
"
Stan,"Yeah. Why?
"
Mr. Jarvis,"'Cause it's being towed.
"
Stan,"What?? 
"
Stan,"Hey, hey! What are you doing?!
"
Driver,"This your bike?
"
Stan,"Yes!
"
Driver,"It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. 
"
Stan,"No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
"
Driver,"Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. 
"
Stan,"No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 
"
Judge,"Yes? Come in.
"
Stan,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
"
Judge,"Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job.
"
Stan,"I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
"
Judge,"Stan Marsh is a bright young man. He's got a great family, a promising paper route; only problem is,  his bike's been impounded!  But now, he's about to find out that getting his bike back isn't so easy. 
"
Stan,"Look, I really need my bike.
"
Judge,"Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you, because then you wouldn't learn anything..
"
Stan,"What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
"
Judge,"Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
"
Stan,"...Yeah?
"
Judge,"Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.
"
Stan,"Me?
"
Judge,"Stan Marsh is a washed-up fourth grader. He's got no job, no bicycle. And his only way out is to coach...  a pee wee hockey team!  And now, he's about to find out that to coach, you've got to grow.
"
Stan,"Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
"
Stan,"My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
"
Stan,"All right, fine, go ahead.
"
Stan,"S- hold it a while, okay?
"
Stan,"When you shoot the puck to another player.
"
Stan,"All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
"
Stan,"Why not?!
"
Stan,"What, you got asthma or something?
"
Stan,"What?
"
Stan,"Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.
"
Stan,"Oh Jesus, can we just practice?
"
Stan,"NO! 
"
Coach,"Well well well! If it isn't the Park County Losers! 
"
Coach,"We just thought we'd come check out the ice for the game tomorrow.  Gavin Throttle, coach of the Adams County team.
"
Stan,"Hey. 
"
Gavin,"Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?
"
Park County,"Yeah!!
"
Gavin,"Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!
"
Adams County,"Right! Follow! 
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ. 
"
Sharon,"Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!
"
Randy,"Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
"
Stan,"I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
"
Randy,"Oh, well that's good.
"
Sharon,"What kind of job?
"
Stan,"I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
"
Randy,"...What? With the-?  What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago.
"
Stan,"I'm not playing, I'm coaching.
"
Randy,"Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
"
Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
Randy,"Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
"
Stan,"I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.
"
Randy,"Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!
"
Stan,"I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. 
"
Randy,"What are we goin' to do, Sharon??
"
Sharon,"What?
"
Randy,"Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
"
Sharon,"Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
"
Randy,"Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
"
Announcer,"And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game.  And that's # 7, Stan Marsh, skating towards the goal, sort of, but h doesn't have the puck. 
"
Denver Goalie,"I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em! 
"
Announcer,"Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants.  Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal!
"
Crowd,"Ohhhh!
"
Randy,"Stan?? Shoot it! 
"
Announcer,"Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!
"
Kyle,"You got it, Stan!
"
Randy,"Take the shot!! Take the shot!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!
"
Announcer,"Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing. 
"
Sharon,"Randy, what's wrong??
"
Randy,"OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
"
Stan,"All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
"
A Man,"Coach? Hey coach.  Could we talk to you, please? 
"
Woman,"We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?
"
Stan,"Oh
"
Mr. Brown,"Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad. 
"
Stan,"Ohhh.
"
Mr. Brown,"Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live?  You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!
"
Mrs. Brown,"Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach.
"
Mr. Brown,"No, I don't mean to take it out on you, coach. It's just...  I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh?
"
Stan,"... I don't know.
"
Mr. Brown,"Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you.
"
Stan,"No, I think you oughta.
"
Mr. Brown,"Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him.
"
Mrs. Brown,"Please, coach, he's...  he's counting on you!
"
Mr. Brown,"Please, coach, he's counting on you!
"
Stan,"Oh uh, hey Nelson.
"
Nelson,"Oh.  Hi, coach.
"
Stan,"Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
"
Nelson,"Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying.  Coach, what's it like when you die?
"
Stan,"Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
"
Nelson,"How come I have to die now?
"
Stan,"Ogh.
"
Nelson,"I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?
"
Stan,"Goddammit, dude, I don't know.
"
Nelson,"I'm sorry.
"
Stan,"No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
"
Nelson,"I think so.
"
Stan,"Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 
"
Nelson,"Thanks, coach.  Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?
"
Stan,"No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
"
Nelson,"Well then, will you just... win for me?
"
Stan,"Okay. 
"
Judge,"Stan Marsh has always lived a carefree life. But in the blink of an eye, what seemed important before can all be put in perspective. Stan Marsh is... ""Bummin' on Cancer."" 
"
Announcer,"Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County. 
"
Adams County,"Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!
"
Stan,"Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
"
Gavin,"Come to surrender, coach?
"
Stan,"Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
"
Gavin,"HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no!  Win! Win! Win! Win!
"
Adams County,"Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ...
"
Stan,"All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 
"
Stan,"Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
"
Gavin,"Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it!  Yeah! Let's go Adams!
"
Stan,"Let's go, Park! Come on!
"
Gavin,"That's it, Brian! Kill him! 
"
Stan,"Get near the puck! 
"
Announcer,"And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie.
"
Stan,"Tie? Well, what does that mean?
"
Judge,"Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all. The big game. A dying boy's hope. Only problem is,  he tied!  And now, he's about to find out that tying isn't the same as winning. 
"
Stan,"Hello?
"
Nelson,"Coach.
"
Stan,"How are you feeling?
"
Nelson,"I feel pretty good, except for the cancer.  Coach? Does God hate me?
"
Dr. Doctor,"Oh, hello Coach.
"
Stan,"Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?
"
Dr. Doctor,"Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied.
"
Stan,"Oh boy.
"
Nelson,"Oh. My cancer hurts.
"
Dr. Doctor,"He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo.
"
Stan,"But what can I do?
"
Judge,"Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news! Our hockey team has just been invited to play against Denver County during a Colorado Avalanche game!
"
Nelson,"Wow.  At the Pepsi Center?
"
Dr. Doctor,"Look! He's coming around again.
"
Nelson,"That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?
"
Stan,"Well, ah, I mean...
"
Judge,"Imagine. If there was one game, one chance, to make everything right. Stan Marsh is being given that chance. But to win, he's gonna have to pull out all the stops in... ""Stanley's Cup""! Rated R. 
"
Stan,"Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em.
"
Nelson,"All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
"
Dr. Doctor,"Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays.
"
Stan,"Well, sure we can.
"
Stan,"Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
"
Stan,"They're not gonna kill us.
"
Stan,"Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
"
Stan,"Hey that's right. We need a ringer. 
"
Park County,"Yeah!
"
Kyle,"Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
"
Stan,"It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 
"
Park County,"Yeah!
"
Kyle,"All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
"
Randy,"Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
"
Stan,"Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
"
Randy,"Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying ""That's my son!""  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 
"
Announcer,"His shot is blocked! What a great save!  And that's the end of the second period. The score is tied 2-all.  And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players.
"
Stan,"All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!
"
Official,"Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight.
"
Stan,"Huh?
"
Official,"The other Pee Wee hockey team didn't show up. There's nobody for you to play. Thanks for makin' the trip though.
"
Park County,"We came to play.
"
Stan,"Sso then we win?
"
Official,"No. Nobody wins.
"
Stan,"Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
"
Official,"Well, you've got nobody to play, there's nothing we can do.
"
Stan,"But it isn't supposed to end like this!
"
Av 1,"Hey, hold on a second. If these kids have been through a lot of emotional changes, then they have to play.
"
Av 2,"Yeah.
"
Official,"Well, who are they gonna play?
"
Av 1,"They can take our place.
"
Av 3,"Yeah. Let 'em play the Red Wings.
"
Stan,"Play the Red Wings?
"
Judge,"Stan Marsh coaches a Pee Wee hockey team. But now  they're going to play in the big leagues.  They've got small bodies but big hearts. Stan Marsh is... going professional. 
"
Av 1,"All right! Give 'em hell, boys!
"
The Avs,"All right! Yeah!
"
Announcer,"It's a tie game here in Colorado as we get set to start the final period. Your attention, please: for this third and final period, the Detroit Red Wings will be playing... the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team.
"
Denver Fans,"OHHHHHHHHH!
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this!
"
Man,"Let them play!
"
Fans,"Let them play! Let them play! 
"
Stan,"Hey, can they do that??
"
Ike,"Ow, no. Oh! 
"
A Red Wing,"Yeah! We did it! We did it! 
"
Randy,"NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO! 
"
Red Wings Coach,"Thank you, Dad.
"
Former Coach,"I'm proud of you, boy. 
"
Fans,"Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings!
"
Nelson,"No hope. No... hope... 
"
Fans,"Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! Red Wings! 
"
Character,Line
Announcer,"And now back to Wheel of Fortune!
"
Pat Sajak,"All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!
"
Randy,"Thanks, Pat!
"
Pat Sajak,"You've got some family here watching tonight. 
"
Randy,"Yeah, they're all rooting for me.
"
Pat Sajak,"And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
"
Randy,"Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!
"
Jimbo,"That's us!
"
Stephen,"Hehey! 
"
Man 1,"Hey Randy!
"
Jimbo,"Good luck!
"
Pat Sajak,"Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is  People Who Annoy You.
"
Randy,"Okay. 
"
Pat Sajak,"As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E.  We just need three more consonants, and a vowel.
"
Randy,"Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
"
Pat Sajak,"And a vowel?
"
Randy,"An O please.
"
Pat Sajak,"Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here.  The category is People Who Annoy You.  Audience, keep quiet, please. 
"
Randy,"Uh... Well, uh...
"
Pat Sajak,"Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh.
"
Randy,"I know it but I don't think I should say it.
"
Pat Sajak,"Five seconds, Mr. Marsh.
"
Randy,"Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...
"
Stan,"Oooo. 
"
Randy,"Oh naggers. Of course, naggers.  Right.
"
Pat Sajak,"Uhh, can we cut to a... Can we cut to a- 
"
Randy,"Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
"
Sharon,"I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
"
Randy,"What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
"
Kyle,"Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
"
Cartman,"Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
"
Stan,"Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
"
Cartman,"Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
"
Stan,"No he's not.  Is he?
"
Kyle,"I don't know.
"
Stan,"I just need to explain things.  Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-
"
Token,"Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning in the news.
"
Stan,"Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
"
Token,"Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan.
"
Cartman,"Ohhhhhhhh?
"
Token,"It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal.
"
Cartman,"Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 
"
Stan,"Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
"
Token,"That's easy for you to say, Stan.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, come on! Here we go!
"
Stan,"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
"
Token,"That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
"
Cartman,"Race war! Come on! Race war!
"
Token,"If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not ""fighting"" anybody. 
"
Cartman,"Token forfeits!  Whites win!  Whites win!  Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!
"
Randy,"I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 
"
Jesse Jackson,"The puzzle you were solving was ""people who annoy you"".
"
Randy,"Uh well, like anybody else thought it was ""naggers"". I mean, right?
"
Jesse Jackson,"Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists.
"
Randy,"Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with  African-Americans.
"
Jesse Jackson,"Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?
"
Randy,"Y-Yes, absolutely.
"
Jesse Jackson,"Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept. 
"
Randy,"Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.
"
Jesse Jackson,"Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing. 
"
Brian,"Ready to go, sir.
"
Jesse Jackson,"Kiss it.
"
Randy,"Huh?
"
Jesse Jackson,"Apologize. Kiss it.
"
Randy,"You want me to kiss your-
"
Jesse Jackson,"That's right.  Apologize.
"
Randy,"Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...
"
Jesse Jackson,"Apologize. 
"
Stan,"Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
"
Token,"Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now.
"
Stan,"Well, yeah.
"
Token,"You just don't get it, Stan!
"
Stan,"Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!
"
Token,"Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! 
"
Stan,"He told my dad he was...
"
Woman,"Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words.  In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself a little person. Who knows what a little person is?  Yes? Over here?
"
Butters,"A midget?
"
Woman,"Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!
"
Mr. Nelson,"Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today?  I would like to share with you all my-
"
Cartman,"No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 
"
Mr. Nelson,"That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-
"
Cartman,"Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric, be quiet!
"
Mr. Nelson,"No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon. 
"
Cartman,"Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 
"
Comedian,"So I said to my wife, ""You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!""  We've got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how many people are actually from Colorado?  Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh?  Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?  Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said ""nigger"" on Wheel of Fortune.  Look! Everybody! It's the ""nigger"" guy. 
"
Man 2,"Hey, it is him.
"
Comedian,"Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the ""nigger"" guy.  Say, ""Hi, 'nigger' guy!""
"
Randy,"Hi, ""nigger"" guy! 
"
Comedian,"That's all right, ""nigger"" guy. You know we're just playin'. 
"
Randy,"Yeah... No problem...
"
Comedian,"Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're straight out of ""Far Out Space Nuts"". Maybe ""nigger"" guy has one. You got one, ""nigger"" guy? 
"
Man 3,"Hey look, Betty. It's that ""nigger"" guy. 
"
Three kids,"Nigger guy. Nigger guy. 
"
Clerk,"Hey. What do you think you're doing? 
"
Randy,"I just... need some aspirin.
"
Clerk,"You aren't welcome in this store, ""nigger"" guy.
"
Randy,"Fine! 
"
Mr. Nelson,"Principal Victoria, I'm very concerned about the behavior of one of your students.
"
Principal Victoria,"Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible.
"
Mr. Nelson,"Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all.  Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me.  I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?
"
Mr. Nelson,"You don't understand.  You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-
"
Mr. Mackey,"Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.
"
Principal Victoria,"Very well, Mr. Nelson.  Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman.  Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people.
"
Cartman,"Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 
"
Mr. Nelson,"You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless.
"
Cartman,"Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 
"
Mr. Nelson,"You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing.
"
Cartman,"Barely! 
"
Mr. Nelson,"No matter how you act, I can rise above it!
"
Cartman,"""Rise above it!"" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 
"
Mr. Nelson,"Shut your fucking mouth!
"
Principal Victoria,"Mr. Nelson! 
"
Mr. Nelson,"He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking
"
Cartman,"Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
"
Mr. Nelson,"Aaaaaaa!
"
Randy,"Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say ""Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy.""  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! ""Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!"" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just ""Nigger Guy"".  Respect. 
"
Stan,"Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that ""little person"" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
"
Token,"Sooo black people are midgets. 
"
Stan,"God dammit!
"
Mr. Nelson,"Excuse me: over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here. 
"
Mr. Nelson,"I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, ""Hello, fatso!""
"
Craig,"...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir.
"
Mr. Nelson,"He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets.  All right all right, here he comes. 
"
Kids,"""Hello, fatso!""
"
Cartman,"Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
"
Mr. Nelson,"Now you know how it feels.  You didn't like it when the tables were turned, did ya?
"
Cartman,"Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
"
Mr. Nelson,"You can't get to me! Words are like bullets!
"
Randy,"And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the ""nigger"" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on ""Wheel of Fortune"", you know and... and when people call me... ""nigger guy""... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 
"
Black Man,"Is this ""nigger"" guy serious?
"
Randy,"Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 
"
Driver,"Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
"
Skeeter,"Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! 
"
Randy,"Awww! Awwww! 
"
Skeeter,"Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
"
Passenger,"Wooo! 
"
Randy,"Whoa! 
"
Skeeter,"Where you goin' ""nigger"" guy?
"
Randy,"Please I, I don't want any trouble.
"
Skeeter,"Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on ""Wheel of Fortune""!
"
Driver,"Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, ""nigger"" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance.
"
Passenger,"You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!
"
Randy,"What do you want?
"
Skeeter,"What do we want?  We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!
"
Man 4,"Leave him alone.
"
Passenger,"Hey... That's that other ""nigger"" guy.
"
Skeeter,"Huh?
"
Passenger,"That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times.
"
Driver,"Michael Richards? Huh well, son of a bitch!
"
Skeeter,"Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two ""nigger"" guys!
"
Man 5,"Make that three.
"
Passenger,"Mark Fuhrman?
"
Skeeter,"Who?
"
Passenger,"He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.
"
Driver,"Well what is this? A ""nigger"" guy convention? 
"
Richards,"We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.
"
Driver,"Come on, Skeeter.  These ""nigger"" guys ain't worth our trouble.
"
Skeeter,"Damn ""nigger"" guys!  We'll be back! 
"
Richards,"You'd better come with us.
"
Richards,"Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee.
"
Randy,"What's going on here?
"
Fuhrman,"We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence.
"
Scott,"They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.
"
Richards,"We're all just like you.
"
Randy,"No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
"
Richards,"I made a mistake too.  I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.
"
Randy,"You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
"
Richards,"You really think that matters?!  You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damned ""nigger"" guy!  Oh, you don't like that, do ya?
"
Randy,"No.
"
Fuhrman,"Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all.
"
Stan,"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
"
Token,"I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
"
Stan,"I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
"
Token,"No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!
"
Stan,"What the hell do you want from me?! 
"
Token,"Nothing!
"
Stan,"Then stop being mad!
"
Token,"No!
"
Butters,"Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
"
Butters,"All right, Eric, come on, Eric.
"
Kyle,"Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.
"
Cartman,"It's a midget, dude.
"
Mr. Nelson,"Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.
"
Cartman,"Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
"
Randy,"Senators, I know it is not normally considered ""American"" to ban words.  But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term ""nigger guy"".
"
Senator 1,"""Nigger guy""?
"
Randy,"Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
"
Richards,"Yeah! That's right!
"
Randy,"Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
"
Skeeter,"Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
"
Randy,"Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called ""nigger guys""? 
"
Senator 2,"Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that ""nigger guy"" could become a slur that refers to all white people?
"
Senator 3,"I'm certainly not a nigger guy. I've never thought a racist thought.
"
Senator 4,"Aw, come on, you're the biggest nigger guy in Washington.
"
Senator 1,"Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill.  All those in favor to ban the term ""nigger guy""?
"
Most Senators,"Aye!
"
Senator 1,"Opposed?
"
Senator 4,"Nay?
"
Senator 1,"The motion is passed! 
"
Randy,"We did it!
"
Field Reporter,"For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use.
"
Senator 3,"From now on, if a person uses the word ""nigger,"" it must be at least seven words away from the word ""guy."" 
"
Field Reporter,"Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is ove-  Oh dammit I said it, didn't I?
"
Mr. Nelson,"AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay!  Okay, you win!
"
Cartman,"Say ""Uncle!""
"
Mr. Nelson,"Ung-cle!
"
Cartman,"Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!""
"
Mr. Nelson,"Caroline, don't go into the light!
"
Cartman,"Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!
"
Mr. Nelson,"There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size.  I have proven my point! My work here is done! 
"
Stan,"What was his point?
"
Kyle,"I have no idea.
"
Stan,"Dude, I don't get it.
"
Kyle,"I don't get it either.
"
Stan,"Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
"
Kyle,"...Huh?
"
Stan,"Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
"
Token,"Now you get it, Stan. 
"
Stan,"Yeah. I totally don't get it.
"
Token,"Thanks, dude.
"
Cartman,"This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"".  This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
"
Kyle,"Is this all you brought us here to see?
"
Cartman,"Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
"
Kyle,"Butters is staying over tonight?
"
Cartman,"Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
"
Butters,"Hey, fellas! 
"
Cartman,"Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
"
Butters,"Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
"
Cartman,"No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?
"
Stan,"Come on, let's go. 
"
Kyle,"Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
"
Butters,"Yeah Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
"
Cartman,"Kyyyle!
"
Butters,"Uh what do you mean?
"
Kyle,"I mean, that if-
"
Cartman,"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
"
Butters,"Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Hrrugh! 
"
Butters,"So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
"
Cartman,"Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
"
Butters,"But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
"
Cartman,"You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
"
Stan,"What'cha do to Butters this time?
"
Cartman,"It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! 
"
Kyle,"Dude!
"
Cartman,"I know I know, check it out, look.  I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!
"
Stan,"Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?
"
Cartman,"Because that makes Butters gay now!
"
Kyle,"No dude, that makes you gay!
"
Cartman,"Eh- ...what?
"
Kyle,"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
"
Cartman,"Nuh uh.
"
Kyle,"Yeah huh!
"
Cartman,"Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?
"
Kenny,"(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)
"
Cartman,"But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
"
Stan,"You are now.
"
Cartman,"No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
"
Kyle,"Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
"
Cartman,"No, it was just for a second!  What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?
"
Stan,"You can't!
"
Kyle,"Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"How?
"
Kyle,"The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
"
Cartman,"Really?
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
"
Cartman,"...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 
"
Kyle,"...Idiot.
"
Butters,"Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
"
Cartman,"Butters.
"
Butters,"Whoa, hey Eric.
"
Cartman,"Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
"
Butters,"A surprise? What is it?
"
Cartman,"It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
"
Butters,"Oh boy!
"
Cartman,"You ready?
"
Butters,"Y-yeah!
"
Cartman,"Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!
"
Butters,"Oh, okay! 
"
Cartman,"Hang on a second here. 
"
Butters,"How come uh, I can't see?
"
Cartman,"'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? 
"
Butters,"Oh uh, ho yeah.
"
Cartman,"All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
"
Butters,"Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?
"
Cartman,"...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
"
Butters,"Well okay!
"
Cartman,"All right, you ready?  All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. 
"
Stephen,"Butters!
"
Cartman,"Uh! 
"
Butters,"Whoa! Hey Dad! 
"
Stephen,"Butters! What are you doing?!
"
Butters,"I'm getting a surprise! 
"
Stephen,"Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! 
"
Butters,"Hey. Where'd Eric go?
"
Stephen,"Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?
"
Butters,"Like what?
"
Stephen,"Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious.
"
Butters,"What's... bi-curious?
"
Stephen,"You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. 
"
Linda,"What's going on, you two?
"
Butters,"Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. 
"
Stephen,"Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious.
"
Father Maxi,"Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?
"
Butters,"...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
"
Stephen,"You see?
"
Father Maxi,"Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you.
"
Butters,"Really?
"
Stephen,"What can I do, Father?
"
Father Maxi,"There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured.
"
Stephen,"A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
"
Butters,"Whoa boy! Camp!
"
Cartman,"Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
"
Kyle,"What are you talking about, fatass?
"
Cartman,"I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
"
Kyle,"You figured that out, huh?
"
Cartman,"That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. 
"
Kyle,"Except for us.
"
Cartman,"Right, except for you.
"
Kyle,"And all the people we tell.
"
Cartman,"Why would you tell anybody?
"
Stan,"Because it's really, really funny.
"
Cartman,"...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier.
"
Kyle,"Like what?
"
Cartman,"Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch.  Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! 
"
Stan,"That isn't funny.
"
Cartman,"Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
"
Kyle,"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
"
Cartman,"Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
"
Kyle,"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
"
Cartman,"Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 
"
Leader,"Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters.
"
Campers,"Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.
"
Stephen,"Thank you so much for taking him in.
"
Director,"Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.
"
Director,"Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?
"
Butters,"Because I'm bi-curious?
"
Director,"That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy.  Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy.  Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life.  Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there.  Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?
"
Bradley,"Humble yourselves therefore under God's might hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6
"
Director,"Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
"
Butters,"I'm bi-curious.
"
Bradley,"Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.
"
Director,"That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed.  We've got another one: Room 22.
"
Staffer,"Aw, darnit!
"
Stan,"Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
"
Kyle,"Okay, my turn. 
"
Cartman,"Where is it, you filthy Jew?!
"
Kyle,"Where's what?
"
Cartman,"You know God damned well what!
"
Kyle,"Let go of me.
"
Stan,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
Cartman,"I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone!  What did you do with my picture?!
"
Kyle,"Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture!
"
Cartman,"Give it back, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"I don't have it!
"
Cartman,"I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
"
Kyle,"Shut up!
"
Cartman,"You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
"
Campers,"The Lord is love this forWith Jesus I can just say noAnd not be confused anymore.
"
Director,"We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you.
"
Butters,"He's bi-curious too?
"
Director,"Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!
"
Pastor Phillips,"Helloooo campers!  Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man!  So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what?  It worrrrked! 
"
Director,"That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip.  And just like a paper clip,  God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight. 
"
Det. Yates,"So you say you were robbed. 
"
Cartman,"Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
"
Det. Yates,"If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?
"
Cartman,"It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
"
Det. Yates,"Okay, what is the picture of?
"
Cartman,"Why... why does that matter?
"
Det. Yates,"Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?
"
Cartman,"All right. It's a picture ...of me.
"
Det. Yates,"Yes?
"
Cartman,"It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
"
Det. Yates,"You were sucking somebody's penis. 
"
Cartman,"No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
"
Det. Yates,"...I see.
"
Cartman,"Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and s-and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep!
"
Det. Yates,"Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury.
"
Cartman,"I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
"
Det. Yates,"Well then, you're screwed.
"
Director,"You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
"
Butters,"Well sure, I guess.
"
Bradley,"Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.
"
Director,"And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
"
Butters,"Well yeah, sure.
"
Bradley,"So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7.
"
Director,"Then do you mind telling us why we found this  1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?
"
Bradley,"That's... that's mine.
"
Director,"You know this is strictly forbidden!
"
Butters,"Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
"
Director,"What's wrong?!  This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!
"
Butters,"Yes, it's all very confusing!
"
Director,"This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids!  Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!
"
Cartman,"That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
"
Liane,"Eric? What's the, what's the matter? 
"
Cartman,"I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
"
Liane,"Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee.
"
Liane,"Oh, now why would he do that?
"
Cartman,"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
"
Liane,"What is the picture of, Eric? 
"
Cartman,"Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
"
Liane,"Ohh, that's nice.
"
Cartman,"But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. 
"
Liane,"Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen.
"
Cartman,"But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 
"
Liane,"It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.
"
Cartman,"You, you will?
"
Butters,"...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
"
Bradley,"Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.
"
Butters,"Awww, that's okay, Bradley.
"
Bradley,"I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused.
"
Butters,"Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!
"
Bradley,"You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great.  Oh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!
"
Butters,"Wuh-what's the matter?
"
Bradley,"I think, I, I th-, I think I like you.
"
Butters,"Well I like you too, Bradley.
"
Bradley,"You do?
"
Butters,"Well yeah!
"
Bradley,"You like like me?
"
Butters,"Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
"
Bradley,"Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! 
"
Butters,"No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
"
Sheila,"Hello?
"
Liane,"Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother.
"
Sheila,"Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman.
"
Liane,"Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth.
"
Sheila,"Excuse me?
"
Liane,"Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine.
"
Cartman,"It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 
"
Liane,"You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Liane,"She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
"
Cartman,"Mom, she's lying!
"
Liane,"She said she was sure, Eric.
"
Cartman,"Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
"
Liane,"Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it.
"
Cartman,"Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final lie
"
Director,"Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
"
Butters,"I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
"
Director,"You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk.
"
Butters,"Oh no, my Dad?
"
Director,"Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?
"
Butters,"Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
"
Director,"We're fixing your confusion!
"
Stephen,"There you are, Butters!
"
Director,"Oheh- hey Dad.
"
Stephen,"What's he done now?!
"
Director,"Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!
"
A counselor,"They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick! 
"
Director,"Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!
"
Bradley,"Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!
"
Director,"Nono, we're fixing you!
"
Cartman,"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell.  Who'd like to go first? 
"
Kyle,"Ow! Quit it, dude!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first.
"
Cartman,"HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
"
Kyle,"He isn't actually going to show everyone...
"
Cartman,"And now this next picture 
"
Director,"Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!
"
Bradley,"It's too late.
"
Butters,"Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
"
Director,"You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.
"
Bradley,"I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
"
Butters,"You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
"
Director,"Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
"
Butters,"All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
"
Bradley,"Yeah.
"
Butters,"I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
"
Bradley,"I think. I think I'd like to come down now.
"
Director,"He's coming down!  We did it!  Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!
"
Stephen,"Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change.
"
Butters,"No. I like bein' bi-curious.
"
Stephen,"Well you know somethin'? So do I. 
"
Butters,"Wait. Now I am confused.
"
Cartman,"And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
"
Bebe,"Eww!
"
Clyde,"Dude.
"
Cartman,"Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Eric, what the hell is this?!
"
Cartman,"What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  ""Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk."" She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? 
"
Cartman,"...Lame.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about.
"
Cartman,"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"No, I mean the problem of head lice.  There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here.
"
Bebe,"Somebody might have lice?
"
Class,"Ewww!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
"
Cartman,"Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
"
Kenny,"(What? Fuck you!)
"
Mrs. Garrison,"I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice, we can stop it before it spreads.  Lice can live in anybody's hair. 
"
Male Louse,"Hello, Kelly. How's my babih?
"
Kelly,"You mean me or the little one?
"
Male Louse,"I mean both.
"
Kelly,"Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay.
"
Male Louse,"How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?
"
Kelly,"Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis.  You okay?
"
Travis,"Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in.  I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer. 
"
Lead Screener,"All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked. 
"
Butters,"Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
"
Stan,"What do you think happens if you do have it?
"
Cartman,"They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 
"
Craig,"I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! 
"
Cartman,"This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
"
Kenny,"(Hey! Fuck off!) 
"
Lead Screener,"Have a seat on the stool. 
"
Lead Screener,"Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em.
"
Clyde,"What?
"
Lead Screener,"You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?
"
Clyde,"Oh my God. Oh Christ no!
"
Lead Screener,"Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor.
"
Clyde,"Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!
"
Lead Screener,"I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.
"
Clyde,"Yes they are!
"
Travis,"Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem!  The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it.
"
President,"And what do you base this on?
"
Travis,"Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being.  If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it.
"
Older Louse,"Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense.  Hello. Anybody? 
"
Travis,"If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!
"
Older Louse,"Poodiggery and poppycock!
"
Travis,"I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation.
"
Older Louse,"Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.
"
Travis,"Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!
"
Clyde,"This is so... embarrassing.
"
Girl,"I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?
"
Clyde,"I have... I have AIDS. 
"
Nurse,"Clyde Harris? 
"
Doctor,"Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school.
"
Clyde,"But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!
"
Doctor,"Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there.
"
Clyde,"...Sick!
"
Doctor,"This shampoo should take care of it.  Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them.
"
Kelly,"Travis? Everything okay?
"
Travis,"Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope.
"
Kelly,"Hope?
"
Travis,"Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? 
"
Louse 1,"It's raining? Now? 
"
Louse 2,"Woohoo! I love the rain! 
"
Travis,"Oh my God.  We have to get out of here!
"
Kelly,"What it, it's just rain.
"
Travis,"We have to get out of here now, Kellih! 
"
Louse 3,"What is that? 
"
Lice,"Whoa!  Ruuun! 
"
Travis,"Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! 
"
Kelly,"My God, Travis, they're all dying!
"
Travis,"Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!
"
Louse 4,"What the hell is it?!
"
Louse 5,"Well it's okay, we're safe up here! 
"
Travis,"I don't think so! 
"
Louse 4,"OoOhOOOoooh!
"
Kelly,"Travis!
"
Travis,"Kellih! Hang on!
"
Kelly,"I can't... hang on!
"
Travis,"You have to! For the babih! 
"
Kelly,"Nooooooooooo!
"
Travis,"Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo! 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?
"
Cartman,"Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"With what?
"
Craig,"With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken.
"
Stan,"Somebody in this class?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Uh, yes.
"
Class,"Ohhhhh.
"
Cartman,"Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"That doesn't matter, it's over.
"
Cartman,"Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?
"
Red,"I wanna know who it was, too.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!
"
Cartman,"That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
"
Class,"Yeah!
"
Bebe,"And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
"
Craig,"How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
"
Butters,"Yeah! Dumb girls!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history.  Ulysses S. Grant-
"
Travis,"Hope. Hope, you're alive.  My God...  Heh?!
"
Louse 6,"Help me... Help meeee... 
"
Louse 7,"Travis.  Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead.
"
Travis,"How many survivors?
"
Louse 7,"Just the six of us. And the Vice President.
"
Travis,"You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!
"
Louse 8,"What do we do now?
"
Travis,"We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here. 
"
Vice President,"Who put you in charge?!
"
Travis,"God did! When he killed my wife! 
"
Cartman,"All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
"
Craig,"Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later.
"
Cartman,"Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!
"
Kyle,"You know what? I'll bet it was you!
"
Cartman,"Me?!
"
Kyle,"This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
"
Cartman,"I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
"
Stan,"You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
"
Cartman,"That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
"
Cartman,"And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! 
"
Butters,"Heh hey guys, what would I do?
"
Bebe,"Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
"
Kyle,"It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
"
Clyde,"Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
"
Cartman,"There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
"
Kyle,"It was him. It had to have been him!
"
Stan,"Yeah... Or you. 
"
Louse 9,"Mark? Mark, you have to hang on.
"
Travis,"This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet.
"
Louse 8,"How?
"
Travis,"First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!
"
Louse 9,"The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.
"
Travis,"We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!
"
Louse 10,"Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?
"
Travis,"Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!
"
Louse 9,"I'm not leaving my husband.
"
Louse 11,"Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.
"
Travis,"You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih. 
"
Louse 12,"I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here.
"
Vice President,"I wanna go too.
"
Travis,"Not a chance.
"
Vice President,"Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live.
"
Travis,"If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you.  Let's go.  Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! 
"
Vice President,"Yeah. Right behind you. 
"
Cartman,"All right, lock that door, Craig! 
"
Kyle,"What's this about, Cartman? 
"
Cartman,"I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
"
Jimmy,"Ur ur re- ur really?
"
Kyle,"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!
"
Cartman,"This is a scientific test, designed to-
"
Kyle,"You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
"
Cartman,"I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
"
Kyle,"Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
"
Cartman,"If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
"
Craig,"Yeah. That's true.
"
Jimmy,"I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
"
Token,"Yeah. Me neither.
"
Kyle,"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
"
Cartman,"Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
"
Cartman,"All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 
"
Butters,"Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
"
Kyle,"It doesn't prove anything!
"
Cartman,"Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 
"
Clyde,"Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over.
"
Cartman,"It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 
"
Token,"What the hell?! 
"
Cartman,"Kenny!
"
Kyle,"No way.
"
Craig,"You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny.
"
Cartman,"Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 
"
Louse 12,"We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone.  I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real.
"
Travis,"It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.
"
Vice President,"So what exactly is your plan, Travis?
"
Travis,"Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.
"
Louse 12,"Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you.
"
Travis,"Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name  Kelly.
"
Louse 12,"She was a lucky woman to have you.
"
Travis,"Luck had nothin' to do with it. 
"
Vice President,"Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!
"
Travis,"Why you murdering bastard!
"
Vice President,"Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!
"
Travis,"What the hell do you want, Vice President?!
"
Vice President,"Walk! 
"
Craig,"Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! 
"
Clyde,"What? What are you gonna do to him?
"
Cartman,"He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 
"
Clyde,"You guys, wait. 
"
Cartman,"What, Clyde?
"
Clyde,"I... nothing.
"
Cartman,"All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
"
"Token, Craig","Yeah!
"
Jimmy,"Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Yello?
"
Clyde,"Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!
"
Clyde,"Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
"
Vice President,"That's good! That's far enough! 
"
Travis,"What are you going to do?
"
Vice President,"I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!
"
Travis,"Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!
"
Vice President,"It was a disaster! Disasters happen!
"
Travis,"Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!
"
Vice President,"Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis! 
"
Travis,"Damn you! Why?!
"
Vice President,"Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not ""conscious,"" we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this! 
"
Clyde,"Ow. 
"
Vice President,"You die he- 
"
Cartman,"Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
"
Kenny,"(Not guilty!)
"
Cartman,"Guilty! I thought so! 
"
Craig,"All right, let's do this!
"
Clyde,"You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?
"
Cartman,"All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 
"
Kenny,"Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!
"
Clyde,"Wait, wait!
"
Kyle,"Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
"
Craig,"He had cooties and he lied about it!
"
Kyle,"Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
"
Clyde,"What?
"
Kyle,"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
"
Stan,"Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice.  Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!
"
Clyde,"Wait a-wait a minute, what?
"
Cartman,"Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
"
Stan,"You had head lice?
"
Cartman,"Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"You all had head lice!  Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!
"
Craig,"I thought I was the only one.
"
Butters,"Me too.
"
Cartman,"But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
"
Kenny,"Dudes!
"
Travis,"Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe.  Keh... k-Kellih? 
"
Louse 13,"You are welcome here.  You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed.
"
Travis,"Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kellih! 
"
Agent,"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie! 
"
Angelina Jolie,"Hello everyone!  Hello!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem.
"
Cartman,"Uh oh! 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Welcome to our class, Baahir.
"
Baahir,"Thank you.
"
Cartman,"Duhude, dude,  not cool!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?
"
Baahir,"Okay. 
"
Cartman,"Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!
"
Cartman,"What's wrong?  Has he been checked for bombs?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!
"
Cartman,"No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
"
Butters,"Now you go, Baahir. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah?
"
Cartman,"Kyle, are you on your computer?
"
Kyle,"What? No, I'm sick. 
"
Cartman,"Get online. I need you to check something for me.
"
Kyle,"Dude, leave me alone.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
"
Kyle,"What? Why?
"
Cartman,"Get online now!
"
Kyle,"All right, all right. 
"
Cartman,"Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
"
Kyle,"Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
"
Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
"
Kyle,"Over a hundred.
"
Cartman,"Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
"
Kyle,"White Stripes
"
Cartman,"That's funny.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Cartman,"He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
"
Cartman,"The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
"
Barbrady,"Hello?
"
Cartman,"Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
"
Barbrady,"From what? Who is this?
"
Cartman,"I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
"
Barbrady,"Are you serious?
"
Cartman,"If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
"
Barbrady,"Like what?
"
Cartman,"Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
"
Barbrady,"Oh jeez.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What the hell?
"
Principal Victoria,"All students are to evacuate the school immediately! 
"
Butters,"Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?
"
Baahir,"Sure, okay. 
"
Butters,"Well all right! 
"
Kyle,"Dude. 
"
Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
Kyle,"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school.
"
Cartman,"Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
"
Kyle,"I guess so.
"
Cartman,"Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
"
Kyle,"Wuh what doesn't follow?
"
Cartman,"Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
"
Kyle,"Okay.
"
Cartman,"Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Actually, there is.
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Kyle,"There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
"
Agent,"Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.
"
Head Agent,"What?  This is CIA head, Alan Thompson.
"
Cartman,"Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
"
Mr. Thompson,"What do you know?
"
Cartman,"He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
"
Mr. Thompson,"I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
"
Cartman,"I said I will only talk to the President!
"
Mr. Thompson,"Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-
"
Cartman,"LALALALALALALALA!
"
Mr. Thompson,"I will have you arrested for-!
"
Cartman,"LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
"
Aide,"Call is coming through now, Mr. President.
"
Bush,"Hello?
"
Cartman,"President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
"
Bush,"Huh? Who.
"
Cartman,"Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
"
Bush,"Hildog?
"
Aide,"Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know.
"
Hillary,"What is it, Brian?
"
Brian,"Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today.
"
Hillary,"Is the thread credible?
"
Brian,"We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. 
"
Hillary,"No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly.
"
Driver,"We've reached the rally site, Hildog.
"
Aide 2,"Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine.
"
Hillary,"Thank you, Chris. 
"
Chris,"They know about the bomb!
"
Blond Russian,"That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.
"
Chris,"Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened.
"
Blond Russian,"That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!
"
Chris,"The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!
"
Blonde Russian,"Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.
"
Chris,"I understand, comrade.
"
Blonde Russian,"Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
"
Kyle,"So then maybe you're wrong.
"
Cartman,"Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
"
Kyle,"Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
"
Cartman,"Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
"
Kyle,"Yeah.  What is that?
"
Cartman,"It's my balls! 
"
Kyle,"God damn it Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
"
Mayor McDaniels,"People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! 
"
Hillary,"It is so nice to be back in a small town like the one I came from. 
"
Hildog Fan,"Here we go! 
"
Brian,"Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat? 
"
Otis,"We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it. 
"
Hillary,"This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is in towns like South Park that you find the true America! 
"
Aide 3,"Oh my God, she got a scent! 
"
Brian,"What?!
"
Aide 3,"The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!
"
Brian,"Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!
"
Aide 3,"Come on, find it. Find! 
"
Brian,"My God, they hid it under the stage?!
"
Female Aide,"No wait, look. 
"
Hillary,"How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh...  on the education of all- Woo haha, whoa there, girl. Haha,  uh, uh, on the education of all children.  Oh, I declare!
"
Otis,"Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...
"
Agent,"Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her...
"
Mr. Thompson,"In her what?
"
Agent,"In her snatch, sir.
"
Mr. Thompson,"What?!
"
Hillary,"What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.
"
Brian,"Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing.  Yes.
"
Mr. Thompson,"Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch.
"
Brian,"A what?!
"
Mr. Thompson,"A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.
"
Brian,"No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!
"
Mr. Waters,"Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke.
"
Hillary,"What is goin' on, Brian?
"
Brian,"Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz.
"
Hillary,"Oh my.
"
Brian,"What do we do? Can we disable the timer?
"
Mr. Thompson,"It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.
"
Brian,"But then that means...
"
Mr. Thompson,"Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever.
"
Mr. Thompson,"Do we have that phone trace?
"
CIA Vice Head,"The call is going through now, sir.
"
Cartman,"Yeah? 
"
Mr. Thompson,"This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the- 
"
Cartman,"Yes, Mr. Thompson?
"
Mr. Thompson,"Well, we've just arrived in your town.
"
Cartman,"Why? Did you find something?
"
Mr. Thompson,"Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.
"
Cartman,"A snuke?
"
Mr. Thompson,"That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
"
Cartman,"I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
"
Mr. Thompson,"We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop.
"
Cartman,"Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
"
Mr. Thompson,"Oh, hey.
"
Stan,"Dude, we totally got let out of school.
"
Kyle,"I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.
"
Stan,"Russian?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
"
Stan,"So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
"
Kyle,"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
"
Stan,"Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
"
Kyle,"Oh that's a good idea. 
"
Mr. Hakeem,"What is going on? What have we done?
"
Mr. Thompson,"They claim they don't know anything about an attack.
"
Cartman,"Big surprise!
"
Police Officer,"Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere.
"
Mr. Thompson,"Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?
"
Mr. Hakeem,"We thought he was at school. He's not at school?
"
Brian,"You're doing great, Ms. Clinton.
"
Hillary,"Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?
"
Brian,"They'll find the detonator, Hildog.
"
Aide 3,"We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?
"
EOD Leader,"I'm not sending any of my men in there.
"
Chris,"Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
"
Vladimir,"Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running. 
"
Agent 2,"Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!
"
Mr. Hakeem,"I tell you, I do not know.
"
Agent 2,"This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying.
"
Cartman,"Let me have time with him.
"
Female Agent,"What are you going to do?
"
Cartman,"We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!
"
Mr. Hakeem,"He should be at school!  Hey!
"
Cartman,"Where is the detonator?!
"
Mr. Hakeem,"Wuh-what detonator are you ta-
"
Cartman,"I can do this aaall day.
"
Mr. Hakeem,"I don't know anything about a-  Aawwwwgh  Stop it! Really!
"
Cartman,"You can make it stop!
"
Mr. Hakeem,"I don't have the- 
"
Female Agent,"Are we just gonna let this go on? 
"
Kyle,"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
"
Stan,"You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 
"
CIA Vice Head,"Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area. 
"
Kyle,"Hey.
"
CIA Vice Head,"Donner, take over that station. 
"
Kyle,"What's going on?
"
CIA Vice Head,"This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!
"
Kyle,"...Homeland Security?
"
CIA Vice Head,"Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!
"
FBI Leader,"'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!
"
CIA Vice Head,"I am!
"
FBI Leader,"Yeah well not anymore you're not. This apartment has just been assigned to the FBI.
"
CIA Vice Head,"That's outrageous! On whose orders?!
"
FBI Leader,"On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!
"
ATF Leader,"Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!
"
Secret Service Leader,"Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.
"
Nelson,"Not anymore I'm not! 
"
Mr. Hakeem,"What are you going to do to my wife?!
"
Cartman,"Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
"
Mrs. Hakeem,"We told you: we don't know.
"
Cartman,"Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 
"
Female Agent,"Did he just inject himself with apple juice?
"
Cartman,"Where is your son?!
"
Mr. Hakeem,"She doesn't know either. 
"
Mrs. Hakeem,"Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!
"
Mr. Hakeem,"I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?! 
"
Cartman,"Answer it! 
"
Mrs. Hakeem,"Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?
"
Cartman,"Butters.
"
Mrs. Hakeem,"Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage.  Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! 
"
Mr. Hakeem,"Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!
"
Cartman,"We got him! I know where he is!
"
Female Agent,"All right, where? We'll send our people in.
"
Cartman,"No no, he's my lead. 
"
Mr. Thompson,"You're not going alone.
"
Cartman,"You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
"
CIA Leader 2,"All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com.
"
Kyle,"Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
"
CIA Leader 2,"Are you tellin' me how to do my job?
"
Kyle,"Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
"
CIA Leader 2,"Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!
"
Chase,"Checking.
"
Stan,"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
"
Female Agent 2,"Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat.
"
CIA Leader 2,"Where's the intel from?
"
Female Agent 2,"We just read it on Drudge Report.
"
Kyle,"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
"
CIA Leader 2,"We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!
"
Kyle,"...Not anymore you're not.
"
CIA Leader 2,"Oh, snap. 
"
Butters,"Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
"
Cartman,"Uuugh! 
"
Butters,"Oh hey Eric.
"
Cartman,"Where is the detonator!
"
Baahir,"The what?
"
Cartman,"You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
"
Baahir,"Leave me alone!  Upta!
"
Butters,"Hey, I was about to win!
"
Cartman,"Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 
"
Terrorist #1,"Get in the van! 
"
Cartman,"Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
"
Terrorist #1,"Get in the van!
"
Aide 3,"That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!
"
EOD Leader,"No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!
"
Brian,"I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.
"
Cartman,"Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
"
Vladimir,"You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!
"
Cartman,"That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
"
Vladimir,"Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
"
Cartman,"Uhh yes, of course?
"
Vladimir,"America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?
"
Cartman,"The Russians?
"
Vladimir,"Before that.
"
Cartman,"The Germans?
"
Vladimir,"Before that.
"
Cartman,"The Germans again?
"
Vladimir,"Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
"
Cartman,"You can't possible mean...?
"
Captain,"Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown!  Yes, Your Majesty?
"
Queen Elizabeth II,"The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.
"
Captain,"Full sail, Your Majesty?
"
Aide 3,"All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch.
"
Brian,"All right. I'm nearing her snizz now.
"
EOD Leader,"God help him.
"
Aide 3,"What do you see, Brian?
"
Brian,"It's dark... cold...
"
Aide 3,"You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz.
"
Brian,"Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! 
"
Aide 3,"You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there.
"
Brian,"There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... 
"
Aide 3,"Say again, Brian.
"
Brian,"There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!
"
EOD Leader,"Brian, get out of there!
"
Brian,"Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!
"
EOD Leader,"Brian? Brian, what's happening?
"
Brian,"It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! 
"
Hillary,"Hoh my!
"
Kyle,"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
"
Female Agent 2,"The British?
"
Agent 4,"Loyalist Red Coats!
"
Chase,"Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!
"
Kyle,"All right! MapQuest the address!
"
Chase,"I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.
"
Kyle,"Good thinking
"
CIA Leader 2,"Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now.
"
Vladimir,"It was good knowing you, comrade.
"
Baahir,"Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.
"
Vladimir,"Yes, but we will be rich.
"
Agent,"Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go! 
"
Mr. Thompson,"The game is over! Get down on the ground!
"
Vladimir,"How did they find us?
"
Mr. Thompson,"We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!
"
Vladimir,"It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes!  What the hell?!
"
Agent,"The power went out!
"
Mr. Thompson,"Well so then what time is it? 
"
Vladimir,"Oh crap.
"
Mr. Thompson,"Take 'em down! 
"
Vladimir,"No! I don't want to die without being paid! 
"
Mr. Thompson,"The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed.
"
Captain,"The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!
"
Soldier,"How?
"
Captain,"Fire at will! 
"
Queen Elizabeth II,"Yes?
"
Captain,"Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution.
"
Queen Elizabeth II,"I see. 
"
Mr. Thompson,"Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
"
Cartman,"Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
"
Baahir,"Really?
"
Cartman,"Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
"
Kyle,"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
"
Cartman,"But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
"
Kyle,"...Maybe. 
"
Cartman,"Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
"
Kyle,"...That is so missing the point.
"
Cartman,"Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!
"
Kyle,"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
"
Cartman,"Yes or no, Kyle?!
"
Kyle,"No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
"
Cartman,"But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? 
"
Mr. Hakeem,"Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country! 
"
Butters,"Awwwww.
"
Cartman,"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
"
Randy,"...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
"
Randy,"Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 
"
Stan,"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
"
Randy,"Wha... what do you mean, ""Why do we do this?"" It's Easter!
"
Stan,"Right, so, why do we color eggs? 
"
Randy,"Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
"
Stan,"Yeah, but why?
"
Randy,"Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins.
"
Stan,"So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
"
Randy,"That's right.
"
Stan,"You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
"
Randy,"Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!
"
Stan,"I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
"
Randy,"What is wrong with him?!
"
Sharon,"Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. 
"
Randy,"You know so little! 
"
Cartman,"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
"
Mall Bunny,"Ahh, don't you think that's-
"
Cartman,"Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
"
Aide,"Smile! 
"
Cartman,"Bye, Easter bunny! 
"
Mall Bunny,"Oh my God. 
"
Stan,"All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
"
Mall Bunny,"Huh?
"
Stan,"What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
"
Mall Bunny,"Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume.
"
Stan,"I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
"
Mall Bunny,"Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid.
"
Stan,"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 
"
Mall Bunny,"I need a break. Can I have a break?  We have a problem. Somebody's onto us. Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions. Only a matter of time before he finds out what Easter's really about. Yes, I understand what must be done. Call the others. 
"
Stan,"Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?
"
Randy,"Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! 
"
Stan,"Dad! You've gotta help me! 
"
Randy,"Hang on, I'm taking a crap.
"
Stan,"Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
"
Randy,"What?
"
Stan,"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
"
Randy,"We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.
"
Gray Hare,"Randy?
"
Randy,"Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
"
Purple Hare,"Ohhh.
"
Randy,"Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
"
Randy,"I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
"
Stan,"Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
"
Randy,"We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
"
Stan,"Does Mom know about this?
"
Randy,"Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
"
Stan,"I don't understand!
"
Randy,"I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
"
Stan,"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
"
Randy,"Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
"
Stan,"So what is the secret of Easter?
"
Randy,"I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
"
Randy,"I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
"
Stan,"Grandpa's in it too?
"
Randy,"Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
"
Stan,"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
"
Randy,"You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
"
Stan,"You mean the old Galveston Lodge? 
"
Randy,"Dammit.
"
Hare 1,"Hey Bill.
"
Hare 2,"Evenin' Marcus.
"
Hare 3,"Heh heh hey, look at you!
"
Hare 4,"Hey everybody.
"
Hare 5,"Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited.
"
Stan,"Must I?
"
Marvin,"There he is! There's my grandson!
"
Stan,"Hi Grandpa.
"
Marvin,"I'm proud of ya, Billy.
"
Stan,"...Stan.
"
Pink Hare,"Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit.
"
Hares,"Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.
"
Pink Hare,"All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!
"
Hares,"Hail Snowball. 
"
Pink Hare,"Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Randy,"Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
"
Stan,"Yeah, I wanna know already.
"
Pink Hare,"Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that- 
"
Gray Hare,"They found us! 
"
White Hare,"Protect Snowball! 
"
Brown Hare,"They're everywhere! 
"
Randy,"Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
"
Stan,"Where am I supposed to go?
"
Randy,"Just get out of here! 
"
Layman,"Where is the rabbit?!
"
Hare 6,"Where are you taking us?
"
Hare 7,"No! I'm not goin' anywhere! 
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ! 
"
Layman,"Who did you give the rabbit to?!  Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far!
"
Stan,"Oh no... 
"
Stan,"Help.
"
Kyle,"What happened?
"
Stan,"My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
"
Kyle,"...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
"
Stan,"Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
"
Kyle,"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
"
Randy,"Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.
"
Nelson,"My legs. I... I think they're broken.
"
Randy,"Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
"
Nelson,"Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... 
"
Randy,"You...
"
Kyle,"Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
"
Butler,"What is it in regard to? 
"
Kyle,"The history of Easter.
"
Teabag,"Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures. 
"
Stan,"Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? 
"
Teabag,"The Keepers?  The Guardians of the Secret?
"
Stan,"My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
"
Teabag,"Come on in. 
"
Teabag,"The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci.  Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table?
"
Stan,"Just bread...
"
Teabag,"Really? Look to Jesus's right.  The food which is a little different color than the others.
"
Kyle,"It kind of looks like... an egg.
"
Teabag,"Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of...  Saint Peter.
"
Kyle,"Who is Saint Peter?
"
Stan,"He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
"
Teabag,"Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. 
"
Kyle,"Peter Rabbit.
"
Teabag,"Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely.
"
Kyle,"I don't see it.
"
Teabag,"Look closelier. 
"
Stan,"He looks like a guy.
"
Teabag,"Look more closelier.  With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it.  That... is Saint Peter.  The original Pope of Christianity.
"
Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
Teabag,"Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat.  It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed...  for a rabbit.
"
Stan,"But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
"
Teabag,"Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive.
"
Kyle,"So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
"
Pope Benedict,"You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
"
Randy,"You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
"
Pope Benedict,"Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
"
Randy,"It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
"
Layman,"I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!
"
Pope Benedict,"The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
"
Randy,"I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
"
Layman,"Take him to be tortured!
"
Pope Benedict,"Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian.
"
Bill,"You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! 
"
Randy,"No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!
"
Stan,"I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
"
Teabag,"I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne. 
"
Butler,"Mr. Teabag! Get out! 
"
Stan,"They found me!
"
Teabag,"Boys, get out of here!  Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time. 
"
Bill,"Check upstairs!  Upstairs clear! Try the office! 
"
Ninja 1,"In here! 
"
Ninja 2,"What's that? 
"
Ninja 1,"PEEEEPS! 
"
Kyle,"So what now?
"
Stan,"If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
"
Kyle,"You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
"
Stan,"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
"
Kyle,"I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
"
Announcer,"Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage.
"
Reporter,"As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection.  For this Easter vigil the Pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor, with a massive rabbit stew. 
"
Violet Hare,"NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m-  AAAAAAAAAAH!
"
Pope Benedict,"Bill, this seems extreme.
"
Bill,"The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.
"
Italian Cardinal,"Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!
"
Bill,"Ya see? 
"
Randy,"Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
"
Pope Benedict,"Yes, hand it over!
"
Stan,"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
"
Pope Benedict,"We promise.
"
Bill,"We swear it, on the cross.
"
Randy,"Just hand over the bunny, Stan!
"
Stan,"Okay, fine. 
"
Randy,"Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
"
Stan,"You said ""hand over the bunny.""
"
Randy,"No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
"
Bill,"Take them into custody! 
"
Stan,"Hey, what the hell!
"
Pope Benedict,"Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need.
"
Bill,"Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These ""whores"" must be punished in front of everyone!
"
Kyle,"You swore on the cross, fatso!
"
Bill,"Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! 
"
Randy,"Oh, we should've seen that coming!
"
Pope Benedict,"Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian.
"
Bill,"It is what Christ would've wanted!
"
Jesus,"Who are you to say that?! 
"
Pope Benedict,"It... can't be.
"
"Stan, Kyle","Jesus! 
"
Singer,"He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
"
Cardinal,"Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq.
"
Jesus,"I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
"
Stan,"Jesus, you did answer my prayer! 
"
Jesus,"Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan.
"
Purple Hare 2,"Ohh, that's me Neato!
"
Jesus,"This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope.
"
Bill,"Kill him!
"
Pope Benedict,"What?!
"
Bill,"He goes against the Church. He must die!
"
Pope Benedict,"All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian.
"
Bill,"You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! 
"
Jesus,"What are you doing?! 
"
Pope Benedict,"I am the Pope!
"
Bill,"You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord!  The Easter vigil will go on as planned!  Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!
"
Jesus,"What is your problem, guy?!
"
Bill,"Lock up those two Jews!  We'll deal with them later.
"
Stan,"No! No! 
"
Reporter,"A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue
"
Bill,"My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! 
"
Randy,"No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.
"
Pope Benedict,"Forgive me, Jesus.
"
Jesus,"We'll never get out in time to stop him!
"
Kyle,"Don't you have any superpowers?
"
Jesus,"Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Jesus,"Stab me with this.  If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
"
Kyle,"N-no way! Do it yourself.
"
Jesus,"Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
"
Jesus,"Just make it quick.  Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
"
Kyle,"Don't make me do this.
"
Jesus,"My son, there is no time! Do it!
"
Kyle,"Eric Cartman can never know about this.
"
Jesus,"I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter.
"
Kyle,"Happy Easter, Jesus. 
"
Jesus,"Awgh! 
"
Kyle,"...Jesus?
"
Bill,"Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! 
"
Cardinal,"Sorry, little bunny.
"
Stan,"Snowball! 
"
Tourist,"Jesus?
"
Jesus,"Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!
"
Bill,"Why won't you go away?!
"
Jesus,"One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
"
Bill,"Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
"
Jesus,"Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. 
"
Crowd,"YAAAY!
"
Stan,"All right Jesus!
"
Crowd,"Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
"
Cardinal,"Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives?  It isn't saying anything.
"
Italian Cardinal,"Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it.
"
Randy,"Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
"
Stan,"Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
"
Randy,"That's my boy.
"
Crowd,"In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it!  Stupid ass man! They're all the same! 
"
Kyle,"Oh God, here we go again.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, ""Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?"" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!
"
Stan,"Uh oh, this isn't good.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Did I say something to you, sugartits?!
"
Stan,"No ma'am.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, ""The Old Man and the Sea""!
"
Cartman,"Have you lost your mind?
"
Stan,"Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!
"
Butters,"But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!
"
Stan,"Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?
"
Kyle,"Our whole weekend is shot.
"
Kenny,"(What the hell are we going to do?!)
"
Cartman,"You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
"
Stan,"We don't?
"
Cartman,"No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
"
Cartman,"¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
"
Laborer 1,"Yeis.
"
Laborer 2,"We looking work, sí.
"
Cartman,"Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for us. Comprende? ""The Old Mand Y La Mer"".
"
Laborer 2,"Okay.
"
Laborer 1,"Sure.
"
Laborer 3,"Okay.
"
Laborer 4,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
"
Laborer 2,"Okay no problem. That's no problem.
"
Laborer 1,"Yeah, we can do that.
"
Laborer 5,"Sí, la samuraisia.
"
Cartman,"Okay, gracias.
"
Stan and Kyle,"Gracias.
"
Stan,"Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are! 
"
Woman,"Are you okay, hon?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how hot you look!
"
Woman,"Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.
"
Woman,"I'm Allyson.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off.
"
Allyson,"No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman.
"
Janet,"Yeah, I've been told that.
"
Allyson,"How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?
"
Janet,"Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.
"
Allyson,"Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called ""Lebow"".
"
Allyson,"Hi Linda, hi Kate.
"
Woman 2,"Hey Allyson.
"
Woman 3,"Who's the new girl?
"
Woman 2,"Allyson always goes for the butch ones.
"
Allyson,"Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?
"
Janet,"Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
"
Allyson,"Yeah. Well, most of the girls here have done each other. 
"
Janet,"He-yeah. Done what?
"
Allyson,"You know.  Had sex. 
"
Janet,"Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?
"
Allyson,"Yeah. I... thought you understood that.
"
Janet,"Oh jeez. 
"
Allyson,"I'm sorry. I thought you knew what ""girl bar"" meant.
"
Janet,"But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. 
"
Allyson,"Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a-
"
Janet,"I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
"
Allyson,"Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?
"
Janet,"Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda  scissor or something.
"
Allyson,"There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet.
"
Janet,"I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.
"
Allyson,"Could I... maybe kiss you? 
"
Janet,"Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!
"
Allyson,"Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go. Let's just have fun tonight.  No commitments.  Just fun. 
"
Janet,"Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!
"
Allyson,"Janet, you're crazy!
"
Janet,"Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!
"
Kyle,"They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
"
Cartman,"They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
"
Laborers,"Sí, sí.
"
Kyle,"What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
"
Laborer 1,"Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh.
"
Laborer 2,"Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh.
"
Laborer 5,"So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.
"
Kyle,"He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
"
Laborer 1,"No, because on the way home, the sharks come and eat the feesh. And so, he no make money. 
"
Stan,"That's it, that's the whole story?
"
Laborer 1,"Sí.
"
Cartman,"All right, did you write the four essays?
"
Laborer 1,"Sí, we all wrote essays for you. 
"
The Boys,"All right!
"
Cartman,"Okay, let's have 'em.
"
Laborer 4,"Have what?
"
Kyle,"You said you all wrote essays.
"
Laborer 1,"Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet.
"
Laborer 2,"I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.
"
Laborer 5,"I wrote three eses: my ese back home, my ese in Denver, and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back. ""Thanks for writing me, ese."" 
"
Kenny,"(Uh oh...)
"
Kyle,"Dude, we're totally fucked now!
"
Cartman,"Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
"
Laborer 1,"We thought it was kind of strange.
"
Kyle,"This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
"
Stan,"You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
"
Kyle,"Son of a bitch! 
"
Stan,"Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde!  You didn't finish your essay either, right?
"
Clyde,"No, I got it done. 
"
Kyle,"Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
"
Jimmy,"Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. 
"
Cartman,"Crap! 
"
Kyle,"We're dead.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Hello, class. Here's my little desk , my nice lil chalkboard. 
"
Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so.
"
Kyle,"Really?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking.  I'm gay. 
"
Stan,"Again?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called ""Les Bos"" where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we...  scissored all night long.
"
Butters,"You have to be careful with scissors.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right?  Oh I'm so happy.
"
Cartman,"That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
"
Class,"Yay!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Teeheeheehee.
"
Janet,"Hey Tracy, hey Kate.
"
Tracy,"Hi Janet.
"
Janet,"Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? 
"
Linda,"Huh?
"
Janet,"Hey Patty.
"
Patty,"What's up, Janet.
"
Janet,"Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes.
"
Big Woman,"Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl? 
"
Janet,"Oh yeah, dyke fight!  You kicked me right in the pussy!  Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! 
"
Lesbian 4,"You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news.
"
Lesbian 5,"What is it, Katie?
"
Katie,"They're closing down the bar. For good!
"
Linda,"Closing it down? They can't do that.
"
Lesbian 6,"This is our home.
"
Janet,"Yeah, this is our home.
"
Katie,"Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians.
"
Janet,"Persians?!
"
Tracy,"So where are we supposed to go?
"
Janet,"We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!
"
Janet,"Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"You're a lesbian now?
"
Janet,"That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
"
Janet,"Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!
"
Lesbians,"Yeah, that's right!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then.
"
Janet,"Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"Mrs. Garrison, get out of here.
"
Tracy,"Well, here's to some great times at this place.
"
Lesbian 7,"Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.
"
Janet,"Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!
"
Allyson,"Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?
"
Janet,"We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them ""We aren't leaving Les Bos.""
"
Katie,"Actually, it's ""Lebow"".
"
Janet,"No, it's Les Bos!  We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!
"
Linda,"The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
"
Emir,"Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar.
"
Lesbian 6,"Yes, we are.
"
Emir,"Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods.
"
Janet,"I knew it! I knew it!
"
Emir,"But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.
"
Janet,"Would you allow straight people in? Men?
"
Emir,"Well... we would allow whoev-
"
Janet,"Choose your next words wisely, Persian! 
"
Emir,"Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy.
"
Janet,"No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! 
"
Emir,"Ohhhhh!
"
Persian,"How dare you! 
"
Narrator,"And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. . All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff.
"
Anchor,"As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.
"
Lesbian 8,"Good for them!
"
Lesbian 9,"You go girls! 
"
Narrator,"The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.
"
Persian 2,"Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help. 
"
Narrator,"The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering.
"
Lesbian 6,"Here they come. 
"
Big Woman,"There's so many of them.
"
Janet,"Lesbos! Positions! 
"
Persian 2,"Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!
"
Janet,"The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
"
Persian 2,"All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!
"
Persians,"Huuu! 
"
Janet,"Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight!  Don't give them an inch!  Ow! Iranian faggot!
"
Persian 2,"Come on, seriously, let us in!
"
Janet,"Never!
"
Narrator,"For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating.  Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated.  The Lesbos... had held.
"
Janet,"Lesbohhhs!
"
Lesbians,"Huok! Huok!
"
Narrator,"The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.
"
Persian 2,"Here he comes. 
"
Narrator,"Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool. 
"
Persian 2,"Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate.
"
Xerxes,"Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle.
"
Narrator,"And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.
"
Xerxes,"I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.
"
Janet,"Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic.
"
Allyson,"Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives.
"
Janet,"We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
"
Linda,"We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
"
Lesbian 10,"Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner.
"
Janet,"Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside.
"
Allyson,"Whattaya mean?
"
Janet,"If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!
"
Allyson,"But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.
"
Janet,"It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
"
Janet,"¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
"
Laborer 1,"Yeis.
"
Laborer 2,"We looking work, sí.
"
Janet,"All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
"
Laborer 2,"Okay.
"
Laborer 1,"Sure.
"
Laborer 3,"Okay.
"
Laborer 4,"Yeah.
"
Allyson,"Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian.
"
Janet,"Sure they do.  Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne.  Persian.
"
Laborer 1,"Sí. 
"
Lesbian 6,"Wow!
"
Janet,"All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too.
"
Laborer 1,"Okay.
"
Laborer 5,"No problem.
"
Laborer 2,"Yes.
"
Laborer 4,"Sí. 
"
Janet,"And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time.
"
Narrator,"A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee.  With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?
"
Lesbian 6,"The Persians are attacking again!
"
Janet,"Take positions, Lesbos!
"
Lesbian 11,"Get outside! 
"
Janet,"No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans.
"
Linda,"Really?
"
Allyson,"How can you tell?
"
Janet,"Let them through. It's okay.
"
Laborer 3,"Hola, ¿como estas?
"
Laborer 4,"Hola.
"
Janet,"Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
"
Laborer 4,"Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal.
"
Janet,"A-are you sure?
"
Laborer 1,"No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge.
"
Janet,"What secret?!  Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?
"
Laborers,"Sí.
"
Allyson,"Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone.
"
Janet,"It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.
"
Xerxes,"Why are you lesbians being so difficult?
"
Janet,"Because we're protecting the only home we have.
"
Xerxes,"I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.
"
Janet,"You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am.
"
Xerxes,"Okay, how about this?  I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money.
"
Janet,"That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you.  I know you're actually a woman.
"
Xerxes,"How..? How did you find that out?
"
Janet,"I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
"
Xerxes,"You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.
"
Janet,"Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking.  But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!
"
Xerxes,"You do? Seriously?
"
Janet,"Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?
"
Xerxes,"No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of  scissor or something.
"
Janet,"Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!
"
Xerxes,"Ohh, that feels so supercool!
"
Janet,"Yeah, scissor!
"
Xerxes,"Ohh, I'm a new woman!
"
Narrator,"And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails.
"
Janet,"Thanks for everything, Xerxes.
"
Xerxes,"No. Thank you, friend.
"
Allyson,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?
"
Janet,"The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
"
Laborer 1,"Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator. 
"
Laborer 2,"Sí.
"
Laborers,"Sí. Sí. Yes. Yes. That's right.
"
Laborer 4,"Sí.
"
Stan,"These guys are pretty good.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 
"
Cartman,"All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
"
Kyle,"Fine.
"
Stan,"Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?
"
Bum,"Spare some change?
"
Cartman,"Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
"
Kyle,"You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
"
Stan,"Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)
"
Cartman,"No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
"
Kyle,"Really?
"
Cartman,"Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
"
Butters,"Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
"
Cartman,"Thank you, thank you.  The ramp ready?
"
Stan,"Yeah, it's all set.
"
Clyde,"He won't make it.
"
Kyle,"Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
"
Cartman,"All right, here we go! Jimmy? 
"
Bum,"Oh! Aww.
"
Cartman,"Yes! I did it!  I jumped over the homeless!  Yes!
"
Kenny,"(Yehes!)
"
Stan,"That was a sweet idea, Kyle. 
"
Kyle,"God damn it, that wasn't my idea!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? 
"
Fire Chief,"Well, I, I short of had an idea.
"
Mayor McDaniels,"Please, Mr. Valmer.
"
Mr. Valmer,"We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at.
"
Other Members,"Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it.
"
Randy,"Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
"
Mr. Valmer,"Ohh, that's a good one.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Nice one, Randy.
"
Gerald,"Like it.
"
Aide,"That's like recycling.
"
Mrs. Testaburger,"All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!
"
Randy,"You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.
"
Homeless Advisor,"Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more.
"
Kyle,"Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
"
Bum,"Got any more?
"
Kyle,"No, that... I thought that was a lot.
"
Bum,"Spare any change?
"
Kyle,"You're welcome. 
"
Kyle,"Oh crap. 
"
Stan,"Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?
"
Kyle,"I don't know.
"
Cartman,"There's a bunch outside my house too.
"
Bum,"Spare any change, sir?
"
Cartman,"No! Fuck off! 
"
Stan,"I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
"
Kyle,"He did?
"
Cartman,"Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
"
Kyle,"Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night.
"
Cartman,"You what?!
"
Kyle,"Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason.
"
Stan,"Kyle, what were you thinking?
"
Cartman,"Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"I don't want you to jump them, retard!
"
Bum 1,"Spare some change?
"
Randy,"No, sorry, I don't have any change.
"
Bum 2,"Got any change?
"
Randy,"No, sorry. 
"
Bum 3,"Can you spare some change? 
"
Bum 4,"Chaaange?
"
Randy,"Huh! I don't have any change. 
"
Bum 5,"Change?
"
Randy,"No!
"
Bum 6,"Change? 
"
Bum 7,"Spare some change?
"
Randy,"Leave me alone I don't have any change!
"
Bum 7,"All right, God bless you, sir.
"
Randy,"Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.
"
Bum 7,"Spare some change?
"
Randy,"I just gave you change!
"
Bum 8,"Change? 
"
Randy,"Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 
"
Gerald,"Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend.
"
Randy,"Waaah!  Awwww!  Stay away!  Stay awayhay!
"
Jimbo,"Randy? Randy, what happened?
"
Randy,"Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!
"
Announcer,"This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs.
"
Chris Swollenballs,"South Park has become overrun with the homeless.  Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible.  Many people are trapped throughout the town. 
"
Randy,"Help! Help us!
"
Stan,"Dude, it's our dads.
"
Kyle,"Oh my God.
"
Chris Swollenballs,"In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change.
"
Bum 9,"Spare some change?
"
Chris Swollenballs,"What the? You can't be in here.
"
Bum 9,"Ya got any change, sir?
"
Chris Swollenballs,"No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?
"
Bum 10,"Chaaaaange?
"
Chris Swollenballs,"No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any- 
"
Cartman,"You see what you did, Kyle?!
"
Stan,"Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
"
Cartman,"They're everywhere!
"
Aide,"What are you boys doing? Get in.
"
Bum 11,"Spare any change, sir?
"
Aide,"Ahhhh!  Come on, let's go!  What the hell were you doing outside?!
"
Stan,"Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
"
Aide,"You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... things. 
"
The Boys,"Ahh! 
"
Aide,"No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit!  Look, our only hope is to talk to the homeless researcher out on Travis Street. He understands what's goin' on better than anybody. Just stick with me, kids. 
"
The Boys,"Aaahhh! 
"
Kyle,"Holy shit, dude! 
"
Stan,"Over here!  Jump down! Go! 
"
Cartman,"Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
"
Kenny,"(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
"
Cartman,"Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
"
Stan,"Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
"
Randy,"No sign of anybody else.
"
Gerald,"That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
"
Randy,"Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
"
Stephen,"And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere.
"
Gerald,"If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try.
"
Randy,"You won't make it through, Gerald! 
"
Gerald,"Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.
"
Bums,"Change? Change sir? You got some change?
"
Gerald,"Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here.   There! There's some change. All right, a little bit.  There you go. Take the change.  Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?
"
Bum 12,"Change, sir?
"
Gerald,"Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change?  Change. Change? 
"
Stephen,"What happened?
"
Randy,"He's become one of them.
"
Homeless Advisor,"Go away, I I don't have any change.
"
Stan,"Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
"
Homeless Advisor,"Yes. Who are you?
"
Stan,"We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
"
Homeless Advisor,"Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on? 
"
Stan,"There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
"
Cartman,"All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
"
Homeless Advisor,"Jump them?
"
Cartman,"I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
"
Kyle,"Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy.
"
Cartman,"I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
"
Kyle,"You barely made it over one, fatass!
"
Stan,"Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
"
Kyle,"God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
"
Homeless Advisor,"Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory. 
"
Randy,"We don't have any change! Go away!
"
Linda,"Anything, Stephen?
"
Stephen,"No. All the phone lines are completely down. 
"
A Man,"Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.
"
Randy,"Find another place to hide, Steve!
"
Steve,"I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
"
Stephen,"We can't just leave them out there.
"
Steve,"Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change.
"
Linda,"You have to let them in, Randy.
"
Randy,"There isn't enough food for more people up here!
"
Steve,"Oh God. One of them is a war veteran.  We're gonna have to give him some change.
"
Stephen,"This isn't happening!
"
Randy,"All right all right, fine! 
"
Bum 13,"Could you spare some change, sir?
"
Randy,"Harrrh!
"
Homeless Advisor,"I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one.  The homeless... can survive solely... on change. 
"
Bum 14,"Change?
"
Homeless Advisor,"They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving
"
Bum 14,"Is that... is that some spare change?
"
Homeless Advisor,"Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance.
"
Bum 14,"Spare some of that change, sir?
"
Homeless Advisor,"But now watch. 
"
Bum 14,"Spare some change?
"
Homeless Advisor,"It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here.  This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days.
"
Bum 15,"Chaaaaange?
"
Kyle,"What's it doing?
"
Homeless Advisor,"It's dying.
"
Cartman,"Cool.
"
Homeless Advisor,"I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.
"
Gerald,"Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? 
"
Homeless Advisor,"Oh my God, they're coming in!  Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!
"
Kyle,"What about you?
"
Homeless Advisor,"Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
"
Cartman,"Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
"
Gerald,"Hello?  I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?
"
Bum 16,"Change?
"
Bum 17,"Spare some change?
"
Bum 18,"Change?
"
Gerald,"Stop it! I really do need change!
"
Bum 16,"Me too. Change?
"
Gerald,"Change?  Hello? Do you have any change?
"
Bum,"Chaaange?
"
Homeless Advisor,"Sorry to take the easy way out.  OW! OH, FUCK! OWW!  OHHH! AH! GOD! 
"
Randy,"No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
"
Jimbo,"No. We can't be.
"
Randy,"Face it, we're gonna starve!
"
Linda,"No, no wait, there's still a box over here.
"
Randy,"Those are cherry! Ich!
"
Head of Public Safety,"Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal. 
"
Gerald,"What? You do?
"
Randy,"How? Call the fire department.
"
Head of Public Safety,"I'm calling my wife!  Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?
"
Linda,"Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay.
"
Stephen,"Ask her what's happening.
"
Head of Public Safety,"Mary, what's goin' on out there? Nobody's coming for us. They what? No! That's impossible. But how can that be? We didn't even-  Hello? Mary.  Mary!
"
Jimbo,"What happened, Glen?
"
Glen,"There's no help coming! She said... because of all the homeless... because of all the homeless in South Park property values have plummeted. I had two liens against my house and so the bank is foreclosing! I don't have a home anymore. 
"
Linda,"Randy, what are you doing?
"
Randy,"He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
"
Glen,"I'm not like them.
"
Randy,"Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
"
Linda,"And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?
"
Randy,"If we have to! Siddown Glen!
"
Glen,"Randy, you can't just-
"
Randy,"SIT... doowwwnnnn!
"
Glen,"This is crazy. How can they just take away my house? Where am I supposed to put all my things? I don't have a place for all my stuff; where am I supposed to put all my stuff? I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow some- money to put my stuff in storage? Come on guys. If you all just help me out a little bit. Each one of you just put in a little... change? Change? 
"
Stan,"What the hell happened here? 
"
Man 1,"That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
"
Stan,"We, just came to ask a question.
"
Man 2,"You homeless or homeowners?
"
Kyle,"We're nine.
"
Man 1,"Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!
"
Stan,"Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
"
Cartman,"Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
"
Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
Man 1,"Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
"
Cartman,"Youu heard about that?
"
Man 2,"Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
"
Cartman,"Thirty was hard enough.
"
Kyle,"Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
"
Stan,"Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
"
Cartman,"Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town.
"
Man 2,"Well, that was easy. 
"
Man 1,"The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know!  Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War!  That's when I started suspecting that  my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept.  After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. 
"
Kyle,"You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
"
Man 1,"That's right, yes.
"
Stan,"What?
"
Kyle,"I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
"
Man 1,"And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
"
Stan,"But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!
"
Man 1,"Right. But we survived.
"
Woman,"Dehhhnyihhhs! 
"
Dennis,"Christine!
"
Christine,"You sonothatitch! You tried to kinn me!
"
Dennis,"I had to, Christine, you were homeless.
"
Christine,"No, I wasn't honeless yeh stukid asshole!
"
Dennis,"Christine, I can't understand you.
"
Christine,"Yeah! Gecause you durned my yits oth!
"
Dennis,"I nurned your rip sauce?
"
Christine,"No! You durned my yits oth!
"
Dennis,"I have no idea what you're saying!  Ow! 
"
Stan,"Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
"
Kyle,"No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea.
"
Stan,"No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
"
Kenny,"(What are you gonna do?)
"
Kyle,"We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
"
Randy,"A bus! A bus is coming!
"
Jimbo,"It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
"
Stephen,"I knew they'd come back for us!
"
Linda,"All right!
"
A Woman,"Yeah.
"
Randy,"Look, Glen. We're saved. 
"
Stan,"All right, I'm turning around
"
Stephen,"Why are they turning?
"
Randy,"What are they doing?  Don't leave us!
"
Kyle,"All right, hit it.
"
Cartman,"Let's hope to Christ this works.

"
Cartman,"Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip.  That's pretty kewl. Let's see...
"
Boy,"Cock! 
"
Cartman,"The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
"
Boy,"Asshole! Cock! Asshole, shit, shit cock! 
"
Clerk,"Ma'am, is that your son over there?
"
Mom,"Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome.
"
Clerk,"Tourette's Syndrome?
"
Mom,"It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.
"
Clerk,"Oh...
"
Boy,"Shiit!  Dumb shiiit!
"
Mom,"A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go?
"
Thomas,"All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!
"
Mom,"Here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, that mom is kewl. 
"
Thomas,"Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!
"
Cartman,"Are you talkin' to me?!
"
Thomas,"No. Cocknose!
"
Cartman,"What's your problem, kid?!
"
Mom,"Oh, a-I'm sorry.  My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome. 
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Thomas,"Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!
"
Mom,"People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.
"
Thomas,"Asshole ASSHOLE.
"
Cartman,"Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
"
Thomas,"Mom, can we just go home, please?
"
Mom,"It's okay, Thomas. They understand.
"
Thomas,"I want tuh go!  Shitfag!
"
Man 1,"Poor kid.
"
Clerk,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
"
Clerk,"It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
"
Man 1,"Yeah! 
"
Cartman,"Twinkle in my eye.  haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. 
"
Clerk,"Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
"
Cartman,"I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
"
Liane,"It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse.
"
Cartman,"Puh- pussy!
"
Liane,"Oh...
"
Cartman,"Pussy! Cock! Shit! 
"
Liane,"Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called ""Tour, Tourette's Syndrome""?
"
Cartman,"Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! 
"
Doctor,"That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
"
Cartman,"...Cocksucker!
"
Doctor,"...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse.
"
Cartman,"Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
"
Liane,"Oh Doctor, can you help him?
"
Doctor,"We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can.
"
Cartman,"But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say.
"
Doctor,"Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve.
"
Cartman,"Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 
"
Cartman,"Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
"
Kyle,"Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. 
"
Cartman,"Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!
"
Principal Victoria,"Good morning, Eric. 
"
Kyle,"Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal?
"
Butters,"Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Craig,"He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say ""shitballs"" to the principal I'd be sooo happy.
"
Cartman,"Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole!  Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it.
"
Principal Victoria,"It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave.
"
Kyle,"He's faking.
"
Cartman,"Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
"
Kyle,"You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
"
Cartman,"...Oh, okay, you figured me out.  Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble.
"
Kyle,"Who cares about saying whatever you-?
"
Cartman,"Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Grrhh, whatever. 
"
Cartman,"Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 
"
Craig,"If I could say ""asspussy"" to the counselor I would be sooo happy.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?
"
Cartman,"Dicktits!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"-when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?
"
Cartman,"Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-
"
Cartman,"Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay?  Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers
"
Cartman,"Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
"
Kyle,"Will you knock it off already?!
"
Cartman,"Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
"
Kyle,"Don't push me, asshole!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Kyle, watch your language! 
"
Craig,"If I could yell ""tampon dickshit"" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore.
"
Principal Victoria,"I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. 
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Hello Mrs. Garrison-  Ass. ASS.  I want to help your class better understand this illness.  Piss!
"
Kyle,"No! Up yours, fatboy!
"
Cartman,"Kyle please! I'm sorry!
"
Kyle,"Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Faking?  You think people with Tourette's are faking?!
"
Kyle,"N-no, I'm just saying that I think-
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say?  Ass! ASS!  We aren't ""faking"", young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass.  PISS! PIIISS!
"
Cartman,"That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!
"
Mr. Donaldson,"This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!
"
Principal Victoria,"No.
"
Mr. Donaldson,"This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this ""bully"" to see that Tourette's is very real.  Piiiss.
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor.  ASS!  I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's
"
Teen Boy,"Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze.  Brrrrr!  It isn't contagious like some people think.  Brrrrrrrrr!
"
Blonde Girl,"A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic  is that I have to bend my neck and snap her fingers. But a lot of people don't even notice it. 
"
Thomas,"Aw shit! COCK!
"
Brunette,"Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I  Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself.
"
Mr. Donaldson,"You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
"
Kyle,"L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
"
Teen Boy,"Fun?  Brrrrr!  This really isn't all that fun.  Brrr, brrrrrr!
"
Thomas,"Aw shit!
"
Brunette,"Boop. 
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Piiiss, coming from my aaass!
"
Thomas,"Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents  Aw shit!  My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead.
"
Kyle,"Dude...
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so.
"
Kyle,"Aw, come on!
"
Mr. Donaldson,"So then you apologize for what you said before?
"
Kyle,"Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities.  Piss! PISS!
"
Sheila,"Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate. 
"
Gerald,"Well Kyle?
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry.
"
Cartman,"Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry.
"
Cartman,"You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
"
Kyle,"I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
"
Cartman,"Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
"
Sheila,"Oh, thank you Eric.
"
Cartman,"Thank you. Big-nosed kike! 
"
Mr. Donaldson,"Well I think we can all put this behind us now.  Piiiss out my aaass!
"
Cartman,"Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face!  Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one.  Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works.  Isn't having Tourette's awesome? 
"
Announcer,"Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report.
"
Hansen,"I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from To Catch A Predator, where we bust men looking for sex with children.
"
Hansen,"Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.
"
Predator,"Oh God, Whoa no.
"
Hansen,"What are you doin' here?
"
Predator,"I'm just' bein' stupid, I guess.
"
Hansen,"But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
"
Cartman,"Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman
"
Hansen,"This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado.
"
Announcer,"Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC.
"
Cartman,"Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
"
Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
"
Kyle,"What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
"
Cartman,"Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
"
Kyle,"Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
"
Cartman,"Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
"
Kyle,"...Scotch?
"
Cartman,"Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
"
Kyle,"You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Then the game is on, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
"
Cartman,"Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" 
"
Kyle,"What did you say?
"
Cartman,"Uhh nuh-nothing...
"
Kyle,"You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
"
Cartman,"Hm. That was... weird.
"
Mr. Donaldson,"We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome.  Piiiss out my aaass! 
"
Thomas,"The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no...  Cock!
"
Cartman,"Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 
"
Craig,"If I could say ""titty sprinkles"" on national television I would be sooo happy.
"
Cartman,"And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up!  Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad.  What the hell is going on?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?
"
Cartman,"No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
"
Patty,"Eewwww!
"
Cartman,"Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
Butters,"Uh hey Eric!
"
Cartman,"Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
"
Butters,"Wuh who are you talking about?
"
Cartman,"Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
"
Butters,"You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
"
Cartman,"I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 
"
Cartman,"Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!
"
Liane,"Is there a problem, sweetie?
"
Cartman,"No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
"
Cartman,"Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 
"
Hansen,"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen.
"
Cartman,"Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
"
Hansen,"Why not?
"
Cartman,"My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine.
"
Hansen,"Why don't you have a seat?
"
Cartman,"No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
"
Hansen,"Go ahead and take a seat.
"
Cartman,"But I'm not gonna do the-
"
Hansen,"Take a seat, right over there.  What are you doing here?
"
Cartman,"I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
"
Hansen,"But you are doing the show.
"
Cartman,"You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
"
Hansen,"Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.
"
Cartman,"No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 
"
Hansen,"Why don't you take a seat?
"
Cartman,"Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
"
Hansen,"Have a seat.
"
Cartman,"No, I'm just gonna go- 
"
Hansen,"Take a seat, right over there.
"
Cartman,"How does he do that?
"
Hansen,"You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called ""To Catch A Predator"". We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline. Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself.  It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you ""shot yourself"". 
"
Announcer,"Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado. This! ...is Dateline.
"
Hansen,"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm  Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction.
"
A Page,"Five minutes, kid.
"
Cartman,"Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
"
Kyle,"Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
"
Thomas,"Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!
"
Kyle,"You sure you don't wanna back out?
"
Thomas,"Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!
"
Kyle,"All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
"
HotForBoys219,"Hi, are you CuteBilly182?
"
Thomas,"Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!
"
HotForBoys219,"Oh God, I'm so turned on right now. This is your house? Your, your parents aren't home, are they?
"
Thomas,"N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!
"
HotForBoys219,"Okay. Cock! Don't take too long. 
"
Hansen,"So now let's meet a child who haaas Tourette's Syndrooome, and who must fi- 
"
HotForBoys219,"Ho, whoa, wait a minute. This ain't no house.
"
Hansen,"What are you doing?!
"
HotForBoys219,"Chris Hansen?! Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it!
"
Hansen,"Sir, why don't you take a seat, right over there.
"
HotForBoys219,"Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv! Whoa! 
"
Hansen,"Aw, not again.
"
Cartman,"Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Surprise, fatass!
"
Cartman,"Kyle, what are you doing?
"
Kyle,"I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
"
Pedo 2,"Hey, I brought you some Wendy's.
"
Thomas,"Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!
"
Pedo 2,"Score! 
"
Pedo 2,"Oh no, it's Chris Hansen! 
"
Audience Members,"Whoa! Who is that? What's going on?
"
Hansen,"What the hell is going on?!
"
Pedo 3,"Wait a minute. Oh God, it's Chris Hansen! 
"
Pedo 4,"Chris Hansen! 
"
Pedo 5,"Dateline?! 
"
Pedo 6,"I knew it! 
"
Pedo 7,"There aren't really brownies! 
"
Hansen,"Hey! Do you have something to do with this? Answer meee!
"
Thomas,"Stupid shit! Cock! 
"
Hansen,"What?! Nobody talks to me like that! Why don't you take a seat? Take a seat, right over there.
"
Thomas,"Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!
"
Hansen,"Fine, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you! 
"
Craig,"Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy.
"
Thomas,"You would?
"
Craig,"Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?
"
Kyle,"Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! 
"
Cartman,"Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Cartman,"I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
"
Kyle,"No, I- I beat you!
"
Cartman,"You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
"
"Thomas, Kyle","Aww shit!
"
Dr. Doctor,"Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. 
"
Randy,"Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
"
Dr. Doctor,"Well, what food have you been eating?
"
Randy,"P.F. Chang's, mostly.  Good stuff.
"
Dr. Doctor,"I'm going to prescribe a laxative.  But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful.
"
Randy,"How painful is ""painful""?
"
Randy,"Oh God. Oh, here it comes.  Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot!  Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot!  Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo.  Ohhh, it's over. It's over.  Oh God.  I feel so much better. Oh.  Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?
"
Sharon,"What is it, Randy? Do you have any-  OH!  Randy!
"
Randy,"Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
"
Sharon,"Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!
"
Randy,"Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 
"
Sharon,"Randy!
"
Randy,"Look what your old man made.
"
Stan,"No way!
"
Randy,"Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
"
Stan,"No, never.
"
Shelly,"Gross, Dad, sick! 
"
Sharon,"All right, will you flush the toilet now?! 
"
Randy,"I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
"
Sharon,"Why?!
"
Randy,"Well he's gotta see this.
"
Sharon,"No, we are flushing the toilet right now-
"
Randy,"No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!
"
Sharon,"Oh, for the love of God, Randy! 
"
Randy,"Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 
"
Randy,"Hey guys!
"
Gerald,"Hey Randy.
"
Stephen,"Oh, hey Randy.
"
Stuart,"Are you feelin' better?
"
Randy,"Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.
"
Jimbo,"You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever.
"
Randy,"Well I don't know about ever...
"
Randy,"I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
"
Randy,"I guess it was pretty big.
"
Stuart,"A football? That's amazing.
"
Stephen,"I've never heard of one that big.
"
Gerald,"Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. 
"
Randy,"It wasn't bigger than mine was.
"
Gerald,"Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! 
"
Randy,"Mine... mine was bigger.
"
Gerald,"I doubt it. 
"
Randy,"You wanna see it?
"
Stuart,"Oh my freaking Lord.
"
Skeeter,"That did not seriously come out of your ass.
"
Randy,"Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
"
Gerald,"Jesus...
"
Stan,"That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
"
Gerald,"It's... other-worldly.
"
Stephen,"Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!
"
Randy,"That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 
"
Sharon,"Randy Marsh!
"
Randy,"Aw crap!
"
Sharon,"What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
"
Randy,"The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
"
Sharon,"Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
"
Secretary,"Guinness World Records America. How can I help you?  The biggest crap? We actually don't keep track of that record, sir.  Because we don't want to.  Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap, and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification.  You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich.  You're welcome.  Jeez, another one.  Guinness World Records America.
"
Randy,"Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 
"
Secretary,"You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their Web site.
"
Chubby Official,"Herr President, take a look at this.  It is a crap sent to us from the United States.
"
EFSM President,"Very niiice.  Has it been checked for accuracy?
"
Chubby Official,"It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo. We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics!
"
EFSM President,"We'd better get on a plane. Right away. 
"
EFSM President,"Hm, enshnusen?
"
Chubby Official,"Verron snusunarich.
"
EFSM President,"What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?
"
Randy,"Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
"
Chubby Official,"I believe I detect some cabbage as well?
"
Randy,"Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee.
"
Sharon,"You have got to be kidding me.
"
Randy,"These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 
"
EFSM President,"It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh.
"
Sharon,"For the love of God!
"
EFSM President,"Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics
"
Randy,"Courics...
"
Chubby Official,"The standard measuring unit for human feces. One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement.
"
EFSM President,"The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.
"
Randy,"But that means...
"
Third Official,"That's right. You are the new world's champion!
"
Randy,"Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 
"
EFSM President,"Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken.
"
M. C.,"He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards, and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono! 
"
Bono,"Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much.  Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award.  Yes?
"
EFSM President,"Yes, Bono, sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken.
"
Bono,"What?! That's impossible! How big was it?
"
Senator,"We are here to honor the first American to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken. 
"
Randy,"Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
"
Senator,"To present the award I give you the dean of the EFSM, Sir Orloff Broloff. 
"
Broloff,"Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-
"
Chubby Official,"Herr Broloff! Herr Broloff! 
"
Broloff,"Das shpoitenhoff?  Ahhh ladies and gentlemen, I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono!
"
People in Crowd,"Oh! Bono? Cool!
"
Broloff,"Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?
"
Bono,"Hello everyone! I, am Bono.  For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics.
"
Crowd,"Whoa!
"
Sharon,"Bono?! 
"
Bono,"As you can see, it is one solid piece.  It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless. 
"
Broloff,"You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono! 
"
Man,"Bo-no! Woo-ooo!
"
Stan,"Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
"
Randy,"I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
"
Stan,"Gee, thanks a lot, Dad.
"
Randy,"You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
"
Sharon,"Come on guys, lasagna's ready.
"
Randy,"Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
"
Sharon,"What are you talking about?
"
Randy,"You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
"
Sharon,"Randy, this is ridiculous!
"
Randy,"Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
"
Sharon,"Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!
"
Stan,"You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 
"
Sharon,"Wha? Wha?
"
Jimbo,"How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
"
Stuart,"'Cause he's Bono, that's why.
"
Stephen,"But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!
"
Randy,"Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
"
Gerald,"Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
"
Randy,"What?
"
Gerald,"Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
"
Stephen,"Hey. Hey that's right.
"
Randy,"Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
"
Skeeter,"Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!
"
Stuart,"With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?
"
Randy,"Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!
"
Stephen,"Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!
"
Randy,"I would need a lot of help.
"
Gerald,"That's what we're here for.
"
Jimbo,"Come on, Randy, what do you say?!
"
Randy,"I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
"
Anchorman,"Tonight, a possible attack on Iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East.
"
Sharon,"Oh no.
"
Anchorman,"But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken?
"
Sharon,"Agh!
"
Anchorman,"Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap, spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's. .
"
Female Anchor,"Is this really newsworthy?
"
Anchorman,"You just don't understand.
"
Female Anchor,"You're right. I don't.
"
Anchorman,"At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry, saying nobody has ever seen it in person. Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy.
"
Bono,"Hello, hello.
"
Broloff,"Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.
"
Bono,"He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
"
Broloff,"Well he's going to try.
"
Bono,"Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich.
"
Broloff,"Bono, we've never had that rule before.
"
Bono,"I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!
"
Assistant,"Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first. 
"
Randy,"Oooooo.
"
Assistant,"Okay, take a deep breath.  I see the crap now. I can't say for sure, but I, I'd say is about... 14 Courics.
"
Jimbo,"Fourteen?! 
"
Stephen,"That's great, Randy!
"
Randy,"Can I, can I see it?
"
Assistant,"Sure. This is your colon, a-and here...  is the feces growing inside your belly. 
"
Randy,"Ahhh...
"
Gerald,"Guys, we have a problem!  I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich.
"
Randy,"In Zurich?
"
Gerald,"They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
"
Assistant,"I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester.
"
Stan,"Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?
"
Butler,"Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller! 
"
Bono,"Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going. 
"
Stan,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
"
Bono,"Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?
"
Stan,"That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
"
Bono,"Let him have it? Why would I do that?!
"
Stan,"Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
"
Bono,"I have the first-place trophy for that.
"
Stan,"Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
"
Bono,"I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
"
Stan,"All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
"
Bono,"Number two?! NUMBER TWO?! 
"
Stan,"Agh!
"
Bono,"Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
"
Stan,"I take it back!
"
Bono,"Say I'm not number two!
"
Stan,"You're not number two!
"
Bono,"That's right! I'm not! 
"
Stan,"What is wrong with that guy?
"
Butler,"Your father is in grave danger. Come with me! 
"
Chubby Official,"It must be quite a crap.
"
Jimbo,"Come on, Randy. You have to push! 
"
Stan,"What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
"
Butler,"Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!
"
Stan,"So Bono's newest record is a lie!
"
Butler,"Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960.
"
Stan,"So?
"
Butler,"So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder...
"
Stan,"He's the record.
"
Butler,"Yes.
"
Randy,"I can't do it! I can't do it!
"
Assistant,"The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!
"
Randy,"But then, does it still count?
"
Bono,"Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
"
Broloff,"I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap.
"
Randy,"No... Nooo...
"
Jimbo,"There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot.
"
Randy,"I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? 
"
Sharon,"What?!
"
Randy,"I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
"
Broloff,"Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact.
"
Bono,"I had a feeling it would be.
"
Stan,"Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
"
Bono,"Get him out of here!
"
Third Official,"What are you talking about, young man?
"
Stan,"Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
"
Bono,"It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
"
Broloff,"It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth.
"
Chubby Official,"Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?
"
Broloff,"It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken.
"
Bono,"Poppa no! Say nothing more!
"
Broloff,"Come to me my... darling precious child.  After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child.
"
Bono,"No Poppa... No Poppa...
"
Broloff,"There there, my little crap.  Don't cry.  Here, do you want the biddy? Hm?  Does Bono want the biddy?  Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?
"
Stan,"Dude.
"
Broloff,"I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time.  Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy.
"
Bono,"Biddy. 
"
Broloff,"My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything.
"
Stan,"That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
"
Chubby Official,"You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff.
"
Broloff,"Have I?!  Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!
"
Randy,"Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 
"
Third Official,"My God...
"
Chubby Official,"It must be over a hundred Courics!
"
Stan,"Dad, are you all right?
"
Randy,"Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.
"
Chubby Official,"Mr. Marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy. 
"
Cartman,"All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
"
Kyle,"This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
"
Cartman,"It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
"
Clyde,"This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. 
"
Cartman,"Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
"
Kyle,"Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
"
Cartman,"O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
"
Token,"... I don't want the code name Blackie.
"
Cartman,"Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
"
Kyle,"This is fucking retarded!
"
Cartman,"Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
"
Cartman,"Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet?  Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!
"
Butters,"This is faggot. Go ahead.
"
Cartman,"Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
"
Butters,"Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.
"
Kyle,"Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
"
Cartman,"It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
"
Kyle,"You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
"
Butters,"Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
"
Cartman,"Set off diversion track C! 
"
Stan,"Dude...
"
Jimmy,"Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
"
Cartman,"Get it!  Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! 
"
Butters,"Wow.
"
Stan,"Cool.
"
Craig,"No way.
"
Token,"Whoa.
"
Jason,"Wow.
"
Cartman,"Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
"
Leprechaun,"You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
"
Cartman,"Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
"
Stan,"Where'd he go? 
"
Leprechaun,"I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! 
"
Craig,"Dude.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, suck my balls. 
"
Kyle,"Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
"
Gerald,"From Ireland.
"
Kyle,"So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
"
Sheila,"Kyle, leprechauns aren't real. You're almost nine now; you need to understand the difference beween real and imaginary.
"
Kyle,"I thought I did. 
"
Cartman,"Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
"
Sheila,"Oh,hello Eric.  Kyle, your friend is here.
"
Cartman,"Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
"
Kyle,"Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
"
Cartman,"Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
"
Kyle,"I'm not doing it, fatass!
"
Gerald,"Doing what?
"
Cartman,"We had a deal, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Just get out of here!
"
Cartman,"You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
"
Kyle,"I don't care if I signed an agreement!
"
Gerald,"Ah hey now Kyle, if you made a deal with somebody, you have to stick by it.
"
Cartman,"Thank you, Mr. Broflovski.
"
Gerald,"What was the agreement?
"
Kyle,"That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
"
Sheila,"Whatwhatwhat?!
"
Cartman,"And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
"
Kyle,"Hey dudes. 
"
Jimmy,"Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?
"
Kyle,"How was what?
"
Jimmy,"Sucking Cartman's b-balls.
"
Kyle,"I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
"
Stan,"Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
"
Kyle,"Uch, I didn't think there would actually be a leprechaun! And I still don't! Why would a leprechaun be warning us of a terrorist attack?! There's another explanation for all this.
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Excuse me. Have you boys seen a leprechaun anywhere lately?
"
Stan,"...What do you know about the leprechaun?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Ooooo, then you did see him.  That's splendiferous! I want you to tell me everything he said. Where was he? What was he doing?
"
Kyle,"All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Well of course they are. But just because they're imaginary doesn't mean they're not real. Haven't you boys ever used your imagination?  You young man! How would you like to be a cowboy? Or a- swashbuckling pirate?  And you! How would you like to be an astronaut, faaar out in space? All it takes is a little...  imagination.
"
Stan,"Who the hell are you?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Still not convinced, eh? I tell you what, boys. What say we all take a ride on my... Imagination Flying Machine? 
"
Kyle,"Dude.
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Hop aboard, kids. I have something to show you.
"
Butters,"Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Ubeuh... uh... n... no?
"
Butters,"Ah, all right then.
"
Stan,"Come on, guys. 
"
Butters,"Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
"
Fanciful Mayor,"All aboard the Imagination Balloon! 
Some people feel imagination isn't real, but I tell them that they're wrong,
'cause whenever I want to play and pretend, I just sing the Imagination Sooong
.
"
Kyle,"Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Oh- Ohhh. But my boy, we're already here.
"
The Boys,"Whoa...
"
Stan,"What is this place?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"This... is Imaginationland.  It's where all the wonderful and goofy things that humans have made up over the years live together.  Citizens of Imaginationland! We have distinguished guests from the world beyond! 
"
Cheetara,"Hello. 
"
Lollipop King,"Welcome to Imaginationland. I am the Lollipop King.
"
Mr. Tumnus,"We are honored to have Creators in our kingdom.
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Now, good news, everyone! These boys did see the leprechaun! 
"
Pat the Hammer,"What did he tell you? Did he have any news?
"
Stan,"Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
"
A Terrorist,"ALLAH!!! 
"
Fanciful Mayor,"OH FUCK NO! 
"
Charlie Brown,"Awwwgh! 
"
Cheetara,"AAAAAH!
"
Kyle,"STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
"
Draco,"Quickly boys! Get on my back! 
"
Butters,"Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!
"
Stan,"Butters.
"
Butters,"Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 
"
Kyle,"Dude! 
"
Butters,"Hey guys!
"
The Boys,"Goodbye Butters.
"
Kyle,"A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
"
Stan,"Hello?
"
Kyle,"Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
"
Stan,"No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
"
Kyle,"...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
"
Stan,"Yeah! How'd you know?
"
Kyle,"Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
"
Sharon,"Stan? Stanley? You haven't seen your little friend Butters, have you? 
"
Stan,"Why?
"
Linda,"Our darling Butters never came home last night.
"
Kyle,"What did they say??
"
Steven,"We don't wanna jump to conclusions, but... we're worried that maybe somebody kidnapped Butters, sodomized him over and over again, and then fed his genitals to wild animals.  There there, darling.
"
Kyle,"...Dude...
"
General,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have dire news. Yesterday, at approximately 18:00 hours, terrorists successfully attacked... our imagination. 
"
Man 1,"Our imagination?
"
Woman 1,"How?
"
Specialist,"The imaginary attack appears to have been in the works for years. The effects of the attack are so far... unimaginable.
"
General,"We've intercepted this videotape the terrorists made for broadcast. Luckily we've kept it from being broadcast to the public. 
"
Fanciful Mayor,"No! It's just a Care Bear! 
"
Man 2,"Oh my God.
"
General,"Later in the video we can see another imaginary hostage; this one reading a forced statement.
"
Butters,"Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
"
General,"Gentlemen, the terrorists appear to have complete control of our imagination. It's only a matter of time before... our imaginations start running wild.
"
Cartman,"I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
"
Judge,"Mr. Broflovski, did you agree to orally imbibe Mr. Cartman's scrotum and testicles?
"
Kyle,"I...
"
Judge,"Is this not your signature on the contract?
"
Kyle,"Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
"
Judge,"From what I've been presented and the evidence put forth, the court has no choice but to order you to place Mr. Cartman's pubicle sac in your mouth, and draw upon it succulently for no less than 30 seconds.
"
Cartman,"Yesss!
"
Judge,"You have twenty four hours to suck aforementioned balls. If after that time you still refuse, the court will be forced to arrest you for contempt. Next case! 
"
Cartman,"Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
"
General,"What I am about to tell you is highly classified. Two days ago, Muslim terrorists hijacked our imagination.  Frankly we don't know what their next move is or how to stop them.
"
Specialist,"In times like these the government often turns to Hollywood for help. You creative filmmakers can think of idea we just can't.
"
General,"That's why we've asked you here, M. Night Shyal-amalam.  The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Village, all very clever films. But can you use your amazing idea brain now to help us stop the terrorists?
"
M. Night Shyalaman,"What if...  What if it turns out they aren't terrorists? But they're actually werewolves? From the future?
"
General,"N, no. No, they're terrorists. They've been linked to Al Qaeda.
"
M. Night Shyalaman,"But what if Al Qaeda, it turns out, is the group being terrorized? By aliens?
"
General,"No- No. That's not an idea, that's a twist. We need ideas.
"
M. Night Shyalaman,"How about we make everyone think that terrorists attacked us? But really, we were all already dead.
"
General,"Get him out of here.  Mr. Bay, can you think of any idea how to outwit these terrorists?
"
Michael Bay,"I believe I can.  We start... by making a big CG building and then we have a meteor go CROSSHH!  and it, and it's all like CRAAWWWLL  a-and motorcycles burst into flame while they jump over these helicopters, right? 
"
General,"No no! We need ideas how to stop the terrorists!
"
Michael Bay,"An eighteen-wheeler spins out of control and it's all like BROSSHH  And then this huuuge tanker full of dyna- 
"
General,"Those aren't ideas, those are special effects!
"
Michael Bay,"I... don't understand the difference.
"
General,"I know you don't. Get him out of here!  Aaand being that we are all big Mel Gibson film fans, we thought maybe you could help us.
"
Mel Gibson,"Ah, my nipples, they hurt! They hurt when I twist them!
"
General,"Yes, uh, I don't suppose you have any creative ideas how to fight these terrorists?
"
Mel Gibson,"How about this? You have that tape that the terrorists made, right? Well, maybe if you did a background check on that videotape, you might find somebody who doesn't belong. Somebody who doesn't fit in Imaginationland! Ohhh!
"
Specialist,"Heyy... that's not a bad idea.
"
General,"Yeah. Say what you will about Mel Gibson, but the son of a bitch knows story structure. Get the videotape and do a background check on everyone in it!
"
Mel Gibson,"Oogh! Yess! 
"
Specialist,"All the imaginary characters in the tape were identified, sir. Count Chocula, Cinderella, Snarf from Thundercats... But here.  Nothing in American folklore or storytelling match this kid. He appears to be... just some kid. 
"
General,"I want digital imaging and resource magnification done stat!  If that kid isn't imaginary, I want to know who he is, where he's from, and who his friends are!
"
Specialist,"Yes sir! 
"
General,"Who are you?...
"
Butters,"Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
"
Pat the Hammer,"Can you tell what the terrorists are doing?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"They're going something to Rockety Rocket.
"
Rockety Rocket,"No! Leave me alone! Haaa!
"
Cinderella,"It doesn't make sense. What do they want with Rockety?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"The only reason they would-  Oh my God. They're gonna blow up the Barrier!
"
Butters,"Uh what's the Barrier?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"The wall! The wall which separates the evil side of Imaginationland from the good side! 
"
Rockety Rocket,"No! No you can't blow up the barrier! Are you insane?! 
"
Cinderella,"We can't let this happen.
"
Suitcase,"It will be the end of Imaginationland.
"
Pat the Hammer,"Yeah. You have to stop them, kid.
"
Butters,"Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Don't you get it?! If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out and take over Imaginationland for good! YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!!
"
Butters,"Waaahaa!
"
Cartman,"Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
"
Craig,"He's not gonna show up to suck your balls dude.
"
Cartman,"He has to. He's been ordered by the court.
"
Clyde,"Hey, he's here. 
"
Cartman,"What? Move aside, move aside! 
"
Stan,"Dude, do you really have to do it?
"
Kyle,"Let's just get this over with!
"
Cartman,"Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
"
Kyle,"God damnit!
"
Cartman,"Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 
"
Specialist,"That's them, sir. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski.
"
General,"You boys need to come with us on a matter of national security.
"
Kyle,"Who are you?
"
General,"There's no time! You need to come with us right now! 
"
Cartman,"Hey, let go of him! 
"
General,"We aren't going to hurt your little friends. We just need information.
"
Cartman,"No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
"
Rockety Rocket,"No! Noooo! 
"
Butters,"Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
"
Terrorists,"ALLAH!! 
"
Rockety Rocket,"AAAAAAAH! Jesus Christ, no!! 
"
Fanciful Mayor,"That was your plan to stop them??
"
Butters,"Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"That's fucking stupid!  They are coming... 
"
Driver,"Glad I picked you up, kid. It's dangerous for someone your age to be hitchhikin'
"
Cartman,"Yeah well, when a man has been wronged... he no longer cares about danger.
"
Driver,"You goin' to Washington to visit family?
"
Cartman,"I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
"
Cartman,"Previously on Battlestar Galactica 
"
Stan,"What is this place?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"This... is Imaginationland.
"
A Terrorist,"ALLAH!!! 
"
Kyle,"WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
"
Butters,"Hold on, fellas!
"
The Boys,"Butters.
"
General,"Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.
"
Fanciful Mayor,"If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out!
"
Terrorists,"ALLAH!! 
"
Rockety Rocket,"No!! 
"
Steven,"Butters, time for breakfast.
"
Butters,"Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream.
"
Steven,"Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you.
"
Butters,"Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
"
Steven,"You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Hey, wake up, stupid!  Come on, wake up, kid!
"
Butters,"No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
"
Fanciful Mayor,"NO! You passed out and peed your pants!
"
Cinderella,"Look! The evil of Imaginationland is coming out! 
"
Butters,"Oh hamburgers! 
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest!  Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home! 
"
Butters,"WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
"
Stan,"Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
"
General,"What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!
"
Kyle,"We just... went on a balloon ride.
"
Specialist,"There must have been some kind of portal or doorway.
"
Stan,"Dude, we don't remember.
"
General,"Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild!  You'd better start remembering!
"
Specialist,"It was the Chinese, wasn't it?
"
Kyle,"...What?
"
Specialist,"We've suspected that the Chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination.  Is that where you were?!
"
Stan,"No.
"
General,"That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?
"
Specialist,"It is better than ours?
"
Stan,"Your what?
"
Specialist,"Our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-
"
General,"Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.
"
Tom,"Ohh, I'm sorry sir.
"
Kyle,"Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
"
General,"Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!
"
Tom,"Yes sir.  We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-
"
General,"THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!
"
Tom,"Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir.
"
Stan,"If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
"
General,"All right, we might as well show it to them.  God-dammit, Tom.
"
Cartman,"Every night, the dream is the same.  I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls.  And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle.""  But then...  ""NO! NOOO!""  It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. 
"
Elderly woman,"You okay, kid?
"
Cartman,"NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
"
General,"Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called ""Project Imagination Doorway.""
"
Stan,"That's not very imaginative.
"
General,"According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has.
"
Lead tech,"But we're close, sir. We're real close.
"
General,"They've been saying that for over forty years.
"
Lead tech,"You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination.
"
Kyle,"Ah I guess.
"
Lead tech,"What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out.
"
Kyle,"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
"
General,"Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.
"
Lead tech,"What song?
"
Stan,"The Imagination song?
"
Lead tech,"That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!
"
General,"Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?
"
"Stan, Kyle","Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation
"
Operator,"Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something.
"
Lead tech,"Was there more to the Imagination Song? Ha, how does the rest of it go?
"
"Stan, Kyle","Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-
"
Kyle,"No, no dude, it went up there.
"
Stan,"Imagina-he-hey-
"
Kyle,"Imagina-eh
"
Stan,"Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
"
General,"I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! 
"
Lollipop King,"Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?
"
Butters,"Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times.
"
Butters,"Really?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke! 
"
Snarf,"Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
"
Lollipop King,"Castle Sunshine?
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain! 
"
Orc,"We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours!
"
The Minotaur,"Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control.
"
Freddy Krueger,"Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot!
"
The Minotaur,"Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here!
"
ManBearPig,"Nonsense!  Your evil is stale!
"
Headless Horseman,"I am the most evil imaginary character! 
"
Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fightin', we're supposed to all be on the same side. 
"
Critter,"Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel.
"
Woodland Critters,"Yaaaay!
"
The Minotaur,"What evil imaginary characters are they?
"
Creature from the Black Lagoon,"They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story..
"
Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them.
"
Rabbity Rabbit,"And eat their flesh!
"
Beavery Beaver,"B'hut first we should rape them!
"
Beary Bear,"How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant?
"
Squirrelly Squirrel,"Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear. 
"
Jason Voorhees,"Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up.
"
Cartman,"Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
"
Secretary,"I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified.
"
Cartman,"Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!
"
Secretary,"There's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on.
"
Tom,"Let me handle this!  I'm sorry, but there is no such thing as Project Imagination Doorway!  Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right.
"
"Stan, Kyle","Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-
"
Stan,"Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
"
Kyle,"Right, then it was ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"" 
"
Lead tech,"It's open! It's open!
"
Operator,"Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir! 
"
General,"All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!
"
Butters,"How much further to Castle Sunshine?
"
Snarf,"Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been. 
"
Butters,"What was that?
"
Lollipop King,"Over here.  Oh Christ. Its Strawberry Shortcake. 
"
Strawberry Shortcake,"Please, let me go.  Wuh.  Wuh!  Dugh! 
"
Snarf,"Oh my God! Snarf. 
"
Strawberry Shortcake,"Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!
"
The Minotaur,"Now kill her!
"
Squirrelly Squirrel,"Whoa whoa, hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her. That's not evil enough.
"
Freddy Krueger,"What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.
"
Jason Voorhees,"Yeah, that's super hardcore.
"
Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now come on y'all. We can do better than that.
"
Beavery Beaver,"Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!
"
Deery Deer,"Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket.
"
Beary Bear,"How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike? 
"
The Minotaur,"Nobody here has AIDS!
"
Woodland Critters,"Awwww!!
"
Beary Bear,"But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket!
"
Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS out in the forest. 
"
Lollipop King,"Dude, run, run, ruuun! 
"
General,"All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?
"
Soldiers,"Yes sir!
"
General,"Are you ready, Kurt Russell?
"
Kurt Russell,"I... I don't understand why I'm here. I I'm just an actor.
"
General,"Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!
"
Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!
"
General,"What?!
"
Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
"
General,"Sector Two?? 
"
Kyle,"Cartman??
"
Cartman,"Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
"
General,"Who the hell are you?!
"
Cartman,"That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!
"
General,"Get him out of here!
"
Cartman,"No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
"
General,"Let me see that!  Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?
"
Kyle,"I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
"
General,"All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here.
"
Kyle,"Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!
"
General,"You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it.
"
Kyle,"Stan?
"
Stan,"Dude, you did make a deal... 
"
Cartman,"Theee conference room is which way? 
"
Cartman,"Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
"
Kyle,"I didn't ""bail,"" I got picked up by the government!
"
Cartman,"Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
"
Kyle,"Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
"
Cartman,"Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
"
Kyle,"Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
"
Cartman,"Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle.  I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. 
"
Kyle,"No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
"
Cartman,"Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do.  By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are...  extra vinegary...
"
Kyle,"Just get to it already!
"
Lead tech,"Entering the portal in five seconds.
"
General,"Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?
"
Kurt Russell,"Check 1, 2.
"
General,"Good luck men! Godspeed!  What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?
"
Kurt Russell,"We're here. We're s-somewhere.
"
Tech 3,"They are inside the imagination, sir.
"
General,"What do you see in there?
"
Kurt Russell,"There's lots of... big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and-  It's a-! ...Oh, Aw, it's just a cute little squirrel.  Hey, it talks, haha. The little squirrel talks.
"
Lead tech,"Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel.
"
Techs,"Awww.
"
General,"Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.
"
Kurt Russell,"Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters.
"
Stan,"Wait, woodland critters... 
"
Kurt Russell,"There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi.
"
Stan,"Get them out of there!
"
General,"What?
"
Stan,"Tell them to get away now!
"
General,"What's the matter?
"
Kurt Russell,"Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH!
"
General,"Kurt Russell, what's going on?!
"
Kurt Russell,"They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!!
"
General,"Get out of there, Kurt Russell!
"
Kurt Russell,"They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!
"
Cartman,"I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
"
Kyle,"Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
"
Cartman,"No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
"
Kyle,"Let's just DO IT! 
"
Cartman,"In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 
"
Guard,"Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
"
Cartman,"Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
"
Guard,"Everyone to the main hall NOW! 
"
Cartman,"No! Goddammit no!
"
Snarf,"Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf.
"
Butters,"Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?
"
Lollipop King,"Wait! There it is. We made it!  Castle Sunshine!  Hurry! Get inside! 
"
Perseus,"The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons! 
"
Butters,"Wait! Waaait! 
"
Perseus,"What imaginary character are you?!
"
Lollipop King,"The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?
"
Snarf,"And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf.
"
Perseus,"And what imaginary character are you?
"
Butters,"Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
"
Perseus,"What's a ""Butters""?
"
Snarf,"The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack.
"
Perseus,"So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!
"
Butters,"I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-
"
Perseus,"You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!
"
Snarf,"Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf!
"
General,"Talk to me! What's going on?! 
"
Lead tech,"Something is... coming through the gate from the other side. 
"
Operator,"What is it?!
"
Tech 4,"Its like a... half man half bear!
"
Lead tech,"And half pig! 
"
Tech 5,"Oh! No, no wait! It's like a half bear half manpig! 
"
General,"Look out! 
"
Lead tech,"No! I think it's more like a half man, and half pigbear! 
"
General,"Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!
"
Kyle,"AAAHHH! 
"
Stan,"KYLE!! 
"
Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAA- 
"
Butters,"Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
"
Perseus,"That is for the Council of Nine to decide!
"
Lollipop King,"Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland
"
Aslan,"Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate.
"
Zeus,"Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it!
"
Aslan,"And what say you, Morpheus?
"
Morpheus,"How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.
"
Glinda,"Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there.
"
Jesus,"No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be.
"
Luke Skywalker,"I'm with Jesus. The evil characters aren't going to just us go.  That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice! 
"
Perseus,"Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world.
"
Aslan,"Bring him here!
"
Paramedic,"Clear!  I'm sorry. He's gone.
"
Cartman,"No! Kyle can't die. 
"
Paramedic,"I'm sorry, young man.
"
Cartman,"Kyle?
"
Paramedic,"Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.
"
Cartman,"NNNOOO!  No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!
"
General,"He's gone, little boy.
"
Cartman,"Zap him again!  Do it!
"
Paramedic,"Charging.
"
Cartman,"DO IT!  Come on buddy.
"
Paramedic,"Clear.
"
Cartman,"Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
"
Aslan,"I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
"
Zeus,"What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-?
"
Morpheus,"Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key.
"
Butters,"Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
"
Luke Skywalker,"If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge.
"
Butters,"But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
"
Aslan,"It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right.
"
Tom,"Sir? Are you sure about this?
"
General,"We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option.  We have to nuke our imagination. 
"
Cartman,"Wake up, Kyle. 
"
Aslan,"Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked.  And so many of us were killed.  The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed.  Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out. 
"
Beavery Beaver,"This is gonna be fun, huh? 
"
Aslan,"We prepare for a battle we cannot win.  Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon,  must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number,  but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy.  Only you can help us win this battle.
"
Butters,"Wuh, what can I do?
"
Aslan,"You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
"
Al Gore,"Back it up!  Look!  Right there!  See that?!  What does that look like to you?! It's ManBearPig!  I told you it was real!  Look again!  There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?!
"
Official 1,"Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore.
"
Al Gore,"Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off! 
"
Doctor,"He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices.
"
Stan,"Hello?  Hello? Anybody? 
"
Kyle,"Stan? 
"
Stan,"Hello?
"
Kyle,"Stan?
"
Cartman,"Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?
"
Kyle,"Cartman, what's happened?
"
Cartman,"What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
"
Kyle,"No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
"
Cartman,"You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
"
Kyle,"Arh!
"
Cartman,"Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle?  What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right!  My balls!
"
Kyle,"Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
"
Cartman,"Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
"
Cartman,"Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 
"
Jesus,"Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!
"
Aslan,"Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!
"
Butters,"What powers? Ah I don't understand.
"
Gandalf,"You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.
"
Butters,"I c-I can?
"
Aslan,"Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
"
Butters,"How?
"
Glinda,"You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.
"
Butters,"How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
"
Luke Skywalker,"Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it.
"
Gandalf,"Whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be. 
"
Steven,"Butters!  You are grounded, mister! You hear me?!  Grounded!
"
Butters,"AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! 
"
Aslan,"What are you doing?! We need Santa!
"
Butters,"I'm trying!
"
Wonder Woman,"Come on, kid, imagine Santa! Believe in Santa!
"
Zeus,"You must believe in Santa!
"
Aslan,"BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!
"
Butters,"GAA HAA!
"
Cartman,"Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
"
Kyle,"Carman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on.
"
Anchorman,"A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination.  Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on.
"
General,"We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild.
"
Reporter 1,"Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?!
"
General,"By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.
"
Reporter 2,"Is nuking our imagination really prudent?
"
Reporter 3,"Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control?
"
Reporter 4,"Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-
"
General,"We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!
"
Reporter 5,"...A-ooch
"
Anchorman,"The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them.
"
Hippie 1,"That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination!
"
Hippie 2,"Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO!
"
Anchorman,"Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination?
"
Mike,"Uh clearly they don't, Steven, and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real. I cite a famous case of Cartman v. Broflovski in which a U.S. court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun.
"
Anchorman,"Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case.
"
Mike,"That's right, Steven, yeah.
"
Kyle,"Oh for the love of God!
"
Stan,"Hello? Can anybody hear me?
"
Kyle,"Stan! Dude, is that you?
"
Stan,"Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
"
Kyle,"No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
"
Stan,"...Oh that makes sense.
"
Kyle,"Dude, what's happening?
"
Stan,"I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
"
Lollipop King,"The evil characters are here. 
"
Jesus,"There are so many of them. HAAAAA! 
"
Aslan,"There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
"
Butters,"Santa. Saaanta.
"
Luke Skywalker,"Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard.
"
Butters,"Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! 
"
Cartman,"How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
"
Anchorman,"A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination!
"
Chief Justice,"The Supreme Court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real, and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them.
"
General,"Thank you.
"
Kyle,"Oh no.
"
Chief Justice,"This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case.
"
Cartman,"...What?
"
Steven,"So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling ""Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway.""
"
Stan,"Kyle? What's happening?
"
Kyle,"The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
"
Stan,"What?! You can't let them do that!
"
Kyle,"What am I supposed to do?
"
Stan,"Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
"
Kyle,"Stan? Stan?? 
"
Cartman,"Where are you going?!
"
Kyle,"I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
"
Cartman,"Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
"
Kyle,"No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 
"
Cartman,"We had a DEAL KYLE!
"
Kyle,"Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
"
Cartman,"IT ISN'T OVER!!  It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!
"
Morpheus,"I need more spinach for Popeye! 
"
Tron Soldier,"I-ee got one. I got him. 
"
Beary Bear,"Hey there. 
"
Icarus,"We're losing the battle! There are simply too many of them!
"
Aslan,"Then the day is lost.
"
Wonder Woman,"Wait! Aslan, look! 
"
Santa,"What? What happened?
"
Luke Skywalker,"You did it, kid!
"
Aslan,"Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
"
Santa,"Huh?  Oh, all right.  Make way for Santa! 
"
Aslan,"Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!
"
Guard 2,"This area is restricted, little boy.
"
Kyle,"Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
"
Guard 2,"Get behind the line with the other protesters! 
"
Hippie 3,"No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo! 
"
Kyle,"Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
"
Guard 2,"You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off!
"
Hippie 4,"Stop that nuke!
"
Hippies,"Stop that nuke!
"
Hippies and Kyle,"Stop that nuke! 
"
Al Gore,"What's going on here?  The military has to do this! It's their only way to kill ManBearPig. 
"
Aslan,"Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!
"
Butters,"Huwhoa! 
"
Perseus,"Aslan! We're losing the battle!
"
Robin Hood,"We managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves, but... now our troops are being shot down by the Cavity Creeps.
"
Aslan,"Cavity Creeps?
"
Cavity Creeps,"We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!
"
Wonder Woman,"What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?
"
Perseus,"Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.
"
Aslan,"Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel! 
"
Robin Hood,"Yes!
"
Gandalf,"His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here.
"
Archangel,"Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest! 
"
Butters,"Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!
"
Stan,"No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
"
Aslan,"Project Imagination Doorway? 
"
Gandalf,"Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.
"
Stan,"No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place.
"
Luke Skywalker,"What?
"
Butters,"Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
"
Stan,"So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
"
Aslan,"We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
"
Stan,"The Chosen One?
"
Butters,"Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.
"
Computer,"Missile launch sequence initiated.
"
General,"All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books.
"
Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!
"
General,"What?!
"
Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
"
General,"Sector 2? 
"
Cartman,"What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
"
General,"What?
"
Cartman,"You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
"
Lab Tech,"Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph.
"
Tom,"Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus.
"
Tech 1,"Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.
"
Tom,"Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!
"
Tech 7,"It's possible that hell is also imaginary.
"
Tech 2,"Uh so then, we're about to nuke hell... that's a good thing, right?
"
Personnel,"Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah.
"
Lab Tech,"What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven.
"
Tech 3,"Yeah, but it wouldn't be real.
"
Lab Tech 2,"So it'd be all right.
"
Cartman,"Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
"
Tom,"Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!
"
Tech 3,"Well then, what about Buddha?
"
Tom,"Well of course he's imaginary!
"
Lab Tech 3,"Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom.
"
Tech 7,"Am I real?
"
General,"All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!
"
Cartman,"No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
"
Stan,"Kyle? Kyle, what happened?
"
Kyle,"Nothing.
"
Stan,"What??
"
Kyle,"Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 
"
Stan,"Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
"
Kyle,"They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
"
Stan,"Well you have to convince them they are real!
"
Kyle,"No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls
"
Stan,"Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?!  Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you.
"
Kyle,"Huh? 
"
Jesus,"Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus.
"
Kyle,"Oh boy...
"
Jesus,"What seems to be the problem, my child?
"
Kyle,"Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
"
Luke Skywalker,"No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker.
"
Kyle,"Aah.
"
Luke Skywalker,"Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, I guess.
"
Luke Skywalker,"Uh okay, now, now hold on, because Superman is here and he wants to say something. 
"
Superman,"Kyle, this is Superman.
"
Kyle,"Hi Superman.
"
Superman,"I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it.
"
Kyle,"I know.
"
Superman,"You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you.
"
Kyle,"Oh God...
"
Superman,"Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch.
"
Jesus,"Popeye, I need some help here! 
"
Lollipop King,"Popeye is being killed by Christmas Critters. 
"
Popeye,"Gaw guguh, getskug off of me!
"
Beary Bear,"Hey, what is that?
"
Butters,"More spinach for Popeye!  Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
"
Jesus,"All right!
"
Aslan,"The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!
"
Computer,"Missile launch in one minute.
"
Cartman,"Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
"
General,"Prepare for launch...
"
Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!
"
General,"What?!
"
Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!
"
General,"Sector 2? 
"
Cartman,"Kyle?
"
General,"The hell are you doing back here?!
"
Kyle,"Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore.
"
General,"Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
"
Kyle,"You have to stop!
"
General,"If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?
"
Kyle,"Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
"
General,"Abort the sequence. 
"
Cartman,"So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
"
Kyle,"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
"
Al Gore,"What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!
"
General,"There's been an abort, Mr. Gore.
"
Al Gore,"No! ManBearPig has to die! 
"
Tech 3,"Oh Jesus no! 
"
Lollipop King,"That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled!
"
Aslan,"The day is ours! 
"
Stan,"Kyle!
"
Butters,"Fellas! Where'd you come from? 
"
Zeus,"What is that? 
"
Butters,"Huh... 
"
Jesus,"He did it!
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Oh look, I'm back!
"
Luke Skywalker,"Nice going, kid. 
"
Fanciful Mayor,"The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.
"
Stan,"Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
"
Butters,"Well I just... used my imagination.
"
All,"Awwww 
"
Cartman,"You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality.   Why look, it's me. And...  And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? 
"
Kyle,"Cartman, don't!
"
Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
"
Stan,"Dude.
"
Lollipop King,"Oh my God.
"
Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
"
Cartman,"No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
"
General,"That's true. You did.
"
Cartman,"Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
"
Santa,"Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home.
"
Kyle,"I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
"
Fanciful Mayor,"Whatever you imagine to be real, is real. 
"
Steven,"Butters?  Butters!
"
Butters,"A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
"
Steven,"Come on, Butters, time to get up. 
"
Butters,"Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
"
Steven,"You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!
"
Linda,"You are grounded, mister!
"
Butters,"Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.
"
Steven,"Oh yes you are!
"
Butters,"Oh yeah? 
"
Steven,"That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded! 
"
Butters,"Ahhh shit.
"
Cartman,"Stan, you guys are good! 
"
Randy,"Sharon, what are the boys doing?
"
Sharon,"Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together.
"
Randy,"They can play guitar now?
"
Sharon,"No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play.
"
Randy,"Ohhh.
"
Sharon,"If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.
"
Randy,"Hey yeah...
"
Stan,"Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
"
Randy,"So you boys like this music, huh?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
"
Butters,"Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
"
Randy,"Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-
"
Stan,"Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!
"
Randy,"I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
"
Cartman,"Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
"
Stan,"Yeah, that's stupid, Dad.
"
Randy,"But... But this is real.
"
Cartman,"Real guitars are for old people.
"
Craig,"Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. 
"
Stan,"Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
"
M.C.,"Are you ready to rock? 
"
Kansas,"""Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more""
"
M.C.,"Game over! You suck! 
"
Butters,"They're gonna do it!
"
Cartman,"Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
"
Kyle,"Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 
"
M.C,"You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!
"
Stan,"Dude, we are total rock stars now!
"
Randy,"You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 
"
Stan,"Hang on.
"
Man,"Stan Marsh?
"
Stan,"Yeah?
"
Man,"I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
"
Stan,"Yeah, we did. 
"
Mr. Kincade,"I'm impressed.  And I'd like to be your manager.
"
Stan,"Wow, really??  Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!
"
Randy,"No way!
"
Kyle,"For reals? 
"
Mr. Kincade,"Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points.
"
Stan,"That'd be awesome!
"
Mr. Kincade,"So, we're in business then? 
"
Mr. Kincade,"Well, what do you think?
"
Producer,"I like it. That's these boys playing?
"
Mr. Kincade,"No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode.
"
Producer,"That's pretty Goddamned impressive.  Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. 
"
Mr. Kincade,"Yes! You did it, boys.
"
Producer,"Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?
"
"Stan, Kyle","Cool! 
"
Stan,"Wow, this is a huge party.
"
Producer,"Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here.
"
Stan,"Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
"
Kyle,"Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
"
Producer,"Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.  Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house.
"
Stan,"Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
"
Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
Producer,"Would you boys like to meet him?
"
Stan,"Are you serious??
"
Producer,"Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero.
"
Jay,"Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys.
"
Stan,"Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
"
Jay,"Thanks...
"
Guest,"Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?
"
Producer,"You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
"
Kyle,"Do we? He's a legend!
"
Producer,"You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks.
"
Tom Shane,"That, would be impressive.
"
Kyle,"Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool.
"
Stan,"Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
"
M.C.,"You Rock!
"
Mr. Kincade,"All right, nice rehearsal, boys.
"
Kyle,"D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, that's almost impossible.
"
Mr. Kincade,"That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. 
"
Kyle,"Oh, okay. Cool. 
"
Mr. Kincade,"You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.
"
Stan,"Really? That'd be sweet.
"
Mr. Kincade,"I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back.
"
Stan,"What, you mean, Kyle?
"
Mr. Kincade,"Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.
"
Stan,"But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
"
Mr. Kincade,"Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd.  I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings.
"
Mr. Kincade,"You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course.  Ah, Thad!  Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.
"
Thad,"Sup? 
"
Mr. Kincade,"That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? 
"
Thad,"Yup.
"
Mr. Kincade,"He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.
"
Stan,"Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
"
Mr. Kincade,"Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do.  Check this out.  Pretty damn good, huh?
"
Stan,"Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play ""John the Fisherman""? 
"
Mr. Kincade,"Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history.
"
Male Diner,"Ohoh, I love this song. 
"
Butters,"Wow wee, look at him go!
"
Kyle,"Hey dude, how'd it-? 
"
Stan,"...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.
"
Butters,"Uh ohhh.
"
Kyle,"Who is this?
"
Stan,"This is um, Thad Jarvis.
"
Thad,"Sup?
"
Kyle,"Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
"
Stan,"Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
"
Kyle,"But it's our game. We bought it together.
"
Stan,"I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part.
"
Kyle,"Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
"
Stan,"Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
"
Cartman,"Oh my God this is so awesome.
"
Stan,"You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
"
Kyle,"I have been sick!
"
Stan,"Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
"
Kyle,"I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
"
Craig,"Dude, this game rules.
"
Stan,"Let's just do this, all right? 
"
Brett,"Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?
"
Stan,"It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out.
"
Brett,"Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.
"
Stan,"Huh?
"
Brett,"Have you ever heard of...  Heroin Hero?
"
Stan,"Hero-Heroin Hero?
"
Brett,"Ihit's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.
"
Stan,"And there's no score? No crowds?
"
Brett,"No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.
"
The Dragon,"Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.
"
Stan,"Dude, this is awesome.
"
Producer,"How are they coming?
"
Mr. Kincade,"No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days
"
Mr. Hart,"They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. 
"
Stan,"Ugh. Damint.
"
Thad,"Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?
"
Stan,"Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play!  No no, you know what?! Screw this!  I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!
"
Mr. Kincade,"Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play.
"
Stan,"Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
"
Thad,"No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.
"
Stan,"Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!
"
Mr. Kincade,"Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?
"
Stan,"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!
"
Thad,"Yeah? Well how about this one? I quite.  I quit I quit I quit.  I quit I quit I quit. I quit. I quit I quit.
"
Stan,"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
"
Mr. Kincade,"Stan, what is the matter with you?
"
Stan,"I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 
"
Mr. Kincade,"What is this?
"
Stan,"Man...
"
Mr. Kincade,"Are you playing Heroin Hero?
"
Stan,"Just, just a little.
"
Mr. Kincade,"No!  Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little! You know, you never catch the dragon!
"
Stan,"I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!
"
Mr. Kincade,"You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!
"
Stan,"No problem.
"
Older Boy,"Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!
"
Kyle,"I'm not done yet.
"
Younger Boy,"Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?
"
Kyle,"No. You're thinking of somebody else.
"
Younger Boy,"Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points.
"
Older Boy,"How come you're playing here now?
"
Kyle,"Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
"
Mick,"You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this.
"
Kyle,"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
"
Mick,"Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free.
"
Kyle,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
"
Mick,"Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all.
"
Kyle,"Thanks, Mick.
"
The Dragon,"Catch me. Come on, catch me.  What's wrong? Follow me. Come on. 
"
Mr. Kincade,"Marsh? Stan, you got-  Oh my God!  Get up, Stan! Wake up!
"
Stan,"Huh? What, uh?
"
Mr. Kincade,"You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!
"
Stan,"The dragon. Where did it go?
"
Mr. Kincade,"You've gotta pull it together!  Pull it together, Goddammit!
"
Mr. Kincade,"Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom. 
"
Token,"Go Stan!
"
Cartman,"All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
"
Token,"Yeah, Stan!
"
Craig,"Dude, what's the matter with him?
"
Butters,"He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
"
Mr. Kincade,"Goddamnit, he's a mess! 
"
Craig,"Oh man, I can't watch this.
"
Mr. Kincade,"What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! 
"
Cartman,"Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
Mr. Hart,"The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed. 
"
Mr. Kincade,"You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! 
"
Brett,"There he is! So, did you break a million yet?
"
Stan,"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
"
Brett,"Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top.
"
Stan,"I just wanna find something else to play.
"
Brett,"Have you played...  Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it.
"
Stan,"I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?
"
Brett,"Sssure kid. Sure. 
"
Radio Host,"All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero.  Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I Guess... they're not playing the game anymore.
"
Skid Row,"""Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
And when you needed me I came through""
"
Stan,"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
"
Kyle,"What are you doing here? 
"
Stan,"Please, ih ih, it won't take long.
"
Kyle,"Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
"
Stan,"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
"
Kyle,"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
"
Stan,"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
"
Kyle,"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
"
Stan,"That isn't it at all. 
"
Kyle,"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
"
Stan,"I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
"
Kyle,"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Kyle,"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
"
Stan,"I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
"
Kyle,"I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
"
Stan,"What, you mean it?
"
Kyle,"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
"
Stan,"Then let's go, dude! 
"
Kyle,"Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
"
Mick,"Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?
"
Kyle,"Thanks, Mick! 
"
Stan,"All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
"
Randy,"Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.
"
The Dragon,"Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on.
"
Stan,"Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
"
Randy,"Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.
"
The Dragon,"Hehe, you almost caught me.
"
Stan,"No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!
"
Randy,"I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
"
Stan,"You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! 
"
Randy,"NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
"
Stan,"Mom, will you get Dad out of here?
"
Cartman,"Stop cheating, Craig! 
"
Craig,"How was that cheating!
"
Cartman,"'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
"
Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Butters,"Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
"
The Boys,"Oh, let's go! Cone on, let's go!
"
Butters,"They're gonna do it! 
"
Craig,"They did it!
"
Jimmy,"Oh my sweet J-Jesus!
"
M.C.,"You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach one million points! Congratulations! You. Are. FAGS. 
"
Stan,"That's it?
"
Kyle,"Goddammit! God dammit! 
"
Cartman,"Butters, you wanna play me next? 
"
Butters,"Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
"
Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
"
Stan,"Dude, Butters, calm down.
"
Butters,"Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
"
Craig,"So who do they say is the cutest?
"
Butters,"I donno.
"
Token,"Who do they say is the ugliest?
"
Butters,"I don't know. Ih it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. 
"
Cartman,"They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
"
Stan,"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
"
Clyde,"If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
"
Kyle,"You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
"
Craig,"You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
"
Cartman,"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
"
Craig,"You don't think they put the fat tub of tard at the bottom?
"
Cartman,"No, because people know I'm not fat! I'm buff. They probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth! Or Kenny cause' he's poor
"
Kenny,"(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
"
Cartman,"Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
"
Butters,"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
"
Kyle,"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
"
Cartman,"All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
"
Bebe,"What??
"
Cartman,"You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
"
Bebe,"That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
"
Cartman,"Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
"
Bebe,"I'm not...  telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! 
"
Cartman,"Fuck you Bebe! Fuck you bitch!
"
Butters,"Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
"
Cartman,"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
"
Cartman,"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"" 
"
Butters,"Neato!
"
Cartman,"At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
"
Butters,"O-kay!
"
Cartman,"Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
"
Nelly,"Ow! What'dja do that for?!  Hey, what's your problem, asshole?! 
"
Cartman,"Bail, bail! 
"
Cartman,"Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
"
Butters,"They sure don't.
"
Cartman,"Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
"
Butters,"You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
"
Cartman,"Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 
"
Cartman,"We got it! We got it! 
"
Craig,"We got the list from the girls! 
"
Nelly,"Give that back you dirty buttholes! 
"
Cartman,"Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
"
Clyde,"All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!
"
A Boy,"Hurry hurry!
"
Craig,"Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?
"
Clyde,"What number am I on?
"
A Boy,"Is it set up?
"
Stan,"It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
"
Clyde,"Me?  I'm the cutest? 
"
Stan,"And then Token, and then me.
"
Token,"I'm number two? Wow.
"
Butters,"Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
"
Craig,"Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! 
"
Cartman,"What?! That's bullcrap! 
"
Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
Kyle,"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
"
Cartman,"You're last, dude! 
"
Kyle,"No way.
"
Cartman,"Yes way! Check it out! 
"
Stan,"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
"
Cartman,"So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
"
Kyle,"I'm last? Last?
"
Stan,"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
"
Kyle,"I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
"
Stan,"Who cares what dumb girls think, right? 
"
Butters,"Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
"
Steven,"Well good for you, Butters.
"
Linda,"Way to go, champ.
"
Butters,"Whoopie! 
"
Steven,"Well, guess we don't have to ground him.
"
Sheila,"Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes.
"
Kyle,"The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
"
Sheila,"Wwwhat? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
"
Kyle,"Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
"
Sheila,"You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. 
"
Kyle,"Oh God! I do?
"
Gerald,"But he has his mother's nose.
"
Kyle,"Ahahah!
"
Sheila,"Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way.
"
Kyle,"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
"
Sheila,"Kyle, come back here! 
"
Cartman,"I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Hrrgh! 
"
Cartman,"Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?
"
Martha,"Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed. 
"
Clyde,"Hey, what's goin' on?  What's goin on? Hey.  Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice.
"
Clyde,"Hey, what's goin' on?
"
Two Girls,"Hey Clyde.
"
Clyde,"Hey.
"
Anne,"Hi Clyde.
"
Clyde,"What's goin' on? 
"
Butters,"Hey ugly! 
"
Clyde,"Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay?  You know, Abraham Lincoln was pretty ugly too, but look what he accomplished.  Chin up, cowboy.  Hey, what's goin' on? 
"
Girl,"Oh, not much, just hanging around-
"
Butters,"Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
"
Clyde,"Butters, that's not cool, man.  He can't help how he looks. 
"
Cartman,"Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right?  Cool. 
"
Blonde Boy,"Hey.
"
Kyle,"Hello. 
"
Bushy Eyebrows Boy,"Are you going to eat your pickle? 
"
Craig,"Could somebody toss the football back? Its over there next to the ugly kids. 
"
Big-Eared Boy,"I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
"
Kyle,"Yeah.
"
Big-Eared Boy,"Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
"
Kyle,"No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
"
Fat Girl,"We're not?
"
Kyle,"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
"
Bushy Eyebrows Boy,"Hey yeah.
"
Kyle,"Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
"
Lola,"I know, that song is so awesome. 
"
Stan,"Uh Wendy. Could I talk to you?
"
Wendy,"Of course, Stan. 
"
Stan,"Just for a minute. Over here. 
"
Lola,"You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him?
"
Wendy,"This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
"
Stan,"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
"
Wendy,"Which one? We make lists all the time.
"
Stan,"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
"
Wendy,"Look, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
"
Stan,"So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
"
Wendy,"Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's just not something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
"
Stan,"Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
"
Wendy,"All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.
"
Bebe,"Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor.
"
Rebecca,"If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?
"
Bebe,"Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
"
Girls,"Sunshine.
"
Lola,"Deliberating ""Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse""? Millie has the floor.
"
Millie,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that  Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's.
"
Blond Girl,"I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest.
"
Bebe,"The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
"
Lola,"Sunshine sparkle Wendy has the floor.
"
Wendy,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.
"
Girls,"What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!
"
Heidi,"Is she crazy?
"
Bebe,"All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. 
"
Wendy,"Go ahead.
"
Stan,"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
"
Rebecca,"You thought you should be number one?
"
Stan,"NO.
"
Bebe,"Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
"
Wendy,"He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
"
Bebe,"I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
"
Girls,"Sunshine.
"
Kyle,"They all laugh at me!  And the girls giggle behind my back!  unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
"
A Voice,"Do not burn down the school, Kyle. 
"
Kyle,"Who said that?
"
A Voice,"I did.  Do you know who I am?
"
Kyle,"Abraham Lincoln?
"
Abraham Lincoln,"I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see.  I want you to look in here.  This woman is Nancy Pinkerton. As a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school. Her life as a youth was filled with praises, and everything being handed to her. Boys told her she was special. She was funny. She was interesting. But that's only because she was hot. It wasn't until she reached age 40, when her looks started to fade, that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special, as a wet carrot.  This is the home of your new ugly friend, Yamal.  Because he's ugly, he gets nothing handed to him. He has to work at making something of himself. But that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult. He will have character, something that kids who are hot rarely develop. Like your classmate, Clyde.  Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special.
"
Clyde,"Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too.
"
Abraham Lincoln,"Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed.
"
Kyle,"But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
"
Abraham Lincoln,"You must be patient.
"
Kyle,"Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
"
Abraham Lincoln,"Very well.
"
Abraham Lincoln,"Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you.
"
Kyle,"I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
"
Abraham Lincoln,"Well then you're just a fucking asshole! 
"
Wendy,"Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.
"
Stan,"I have no idea what you're talking about.
"
Wendy,"It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. 
"
Rebecca,"Oh, hey Wendy.
"
Wendy,"Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
"
Rebecca,"Oho Wendy, we're done with that list.
"
Wendy,"I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-
"
Rebecca,"All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy!  You might not like... what you find!  Just back off and stop asking questions!  You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go! 
"
Stan,"That didn't sparkle with her, did it?
"
Clerk,"One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid,  seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches.  Okay, is that everything, little boy?
"
Kyle,"That should just about do it.
"
Jerry,"Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?
"
Wendy,"Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
"
Lola,"Why would she do that?
"
Wendy,"Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list. 
"
Jenny,"You just couldn't let it go! 
"
Wendy,"Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.
"
Jenny,"I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy! 
"
Lola,"Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father own the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough.
"
Wendy,"You knew!
"
Lola,"Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one!
"
Wendy,"So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
"
Jenny,"Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!
"
Wendy,"No. Not Bebe.
"
Jenny,"She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.
"
Stan,"What's going on?
"
Wendy,"When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-
"
Jenny,"Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simple generate a new list! ""Biggest Liars""! And put you at the top!
"
Lola,"Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!
"
Wendy,"I don't think so! 
"
Lola,"AAGH!
"
Wendy,"Stan, run!
"
Stan,"Jesus, dude! 
"
Stan,"Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
"
Yamal,"He's burning down the school.
"
Wendy,"What?
"
Yamal,"He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.
"
Kyle,"All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
"
Stan,"Kyle! Kyle, don't!
"
Kyle,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
"
Stan,"The list was a forgery, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Huh??
"
Stan,"It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 
"
A Girl,"That's about far enough!  Give me that list, Wendy!
"
Kyle,"Stan, what is going on?!
"
Stan,"It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
"
Bebe,"Kyle was simple a casualty! To move Clyde meant that Craig has to be moved to number twelve, which moved Jimmy down and moved Jason up!
"
Kyle,"So what number was I??
"
Wendy,"You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!
"
Bebe,"Did you seeee these shoes, Wendy?!  They're incredible!
"
Wendy,"It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.
"
Bebe,"Right?
"
Wendy,"Is that a lace across the top?
"
Bebe,"No, it's a little strap.
"
Stan,"Wendy!
"
Wendy,"Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!
"
Bebe,"If you hadn't gone all Nancy Drew on us, this would have just gone away! 
"
Kyle,"She's gonna kill us?
"
Wendy,"It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.
"
Bebe,"Oh please, you're lying. 
"
Officer,"Give it up, Bebe. We know all about it. The list was compromised. Kyle Broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class. 
"
Stan,"Wendy! 
"
Kenny,"(Aah-) 
"
Bebe,"Wait, I, I didn't do anything wrong.
"
Officer,"You can explain all that downtown. 
"
Stan,"Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 
"
Stan,"Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
"
Stan,"...Abe Lincoln?
"
Wendy,"Stan, it's been really great hanging out with you again. I feel like you've changed somehow. In a really awesome way. 
"
Stan,"Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 
"
Character,Line
Cartman,"AHHHHHH.
"
Dentist,"Well, there's no doubt about it. Those tonsils need to come out.
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Liane,"Uh, what exactly does that entail, doctor?
"
Dentist,"It's a very simple operation. We'll just put you to sleep, Eric, and when you wake up you'll be tonsil-free!
"
Cartman,"No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
"
Dentist,"Oh, I thought you were a tough kid! You're not scared of hospitals, are you?
"
Cartman,"No, I'm not scared... I just- I don't want my tonsils out, that's all!
"
Dentist,"Well then I guess you don't want all the ice cream you get after the surgery, either.
"
Cartman,"...Ice cream?
"
Dentist,"It'd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who aren't scared of hospitals.
"
Liane,"What do you say, champ? Think you can tough it out?
"
Cartman,"Well...you did say free ice cream? 
"
Liane,"Poopsiekins, wake up. Wake up, honey.
"
Cartman,"Uh. It's over?
"
Liane,"That's right, you did it, Poopsiekins!
"
Cartman,"Its over! I didn't feel anything! You were right, Mom!
"
Liane,"I'm so proud of you, Eric.
"
Cartman,"All right, so where's my ice cream?
"
Liane,"Oh, here's the doctors now! Hi, doctor.
"
Cartman,"You were right, doctor! Everything is okay!
"
Doctor,"No, it's not. Eric, I'm afraid that we've accidentally infected you with the AIDS virus.
"
Liane,"...What!?
"
Cartman,"What's that supposed to mean?!
"
Doctor,"During the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood. A mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with HIV. It was a one in a billion fluke.
"
Cartman,"I HAVE AIDS?
"
Doctor,"Not yet, but we've confirmed that you now have the virus that causes AIDS. We are very sorry.
"
Cartman,"""SORRY""?! YOU GAVE ME AIDS AND YOU'RE ""SORRY""?!
"
Liane,"Oh, my poor little baby!
"
Cartman,"Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
"
Liane,"Oh God!  Oh no!
"
Cartman,"No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
"
Doctor,"We're going to do everything in our power to make this up to you, Eric. For starters, I think I owe you some ice cream. 
"
Cartman,"Fuck your ice cream! You said I'd be fine! You all said I'd be FINE!
"
Liane,"Oh, oh, my baby has HIV!
"
Cartman,"NO! NOOOOOOOO!
"
Principal Victoria,"Thank you for coming, everyone. 
"
Principal Victoria,"Boys, please take a seat.
"
Stan,"What's going on? Are we in trouble?
"
Principal Victoria,"Boys, the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends... has a serious illness. Eric Cartman has been diagnosed with HIV.
"
Stan,"...What?
"
Butters,"Oh no.
"
Doctor 2,"He's been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion. The disease is in very early stages and completely manageable, but he's naturally a bit scared.
"
Kyle,"Cartman has HIV?
"
Doctor 2,"We need everyone to understand you can't get the virus from Eric. You can still give him hugs and even kisses. Don't be afraid of him, just-
"
Kyle,"Excuse me. Eric Cartman has HIV?
"
Principal Victoria,"All right, we're going to bring Eric in now, and let's all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love, okay?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric? Come on in, your friends want to say ""Hi"", m'kay? 
"
Kyle,"...No. Way.
"
Butters,"How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
"
Cartman,"God damn it, this sucks ass!
"
Kyle,"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
"
Butters,"Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
"
Cartman,"Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
"
Doctor 2,"No, you're not going to die, Eric. AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be. There are advances in treatment and-
"
Cartman,"Not a big deal!? Is that how everyone feels!? People need to understand the seriousness of this illness, and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
"
M.C.,"We are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with HIV. 
"
Cartman,"Where the hell is everybody? 
"
Liane,"Excuse me, shouldn't we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started?
"
Waitress,"This is everyone. We didn't sell that many tickets.
"
Butters,"Great benefit, Eric!
"
Jimmy,"The Italian meatballs are fa-fantastic.
"
Cartman,"So this is it?
"
Waitress,"I'm afraid AIDS benefits aren't as popular as they used to be. AIDS was more the '80s/'90s disease. It's all about cancer now. 
"
Cartman,"Well that's just great! Of all the times to get AIDS, I get it right when everyone stops givin' a crap!
"
M.C.,"With all of your help, we have raised over seventeen dollars for AIDS tonight, and that money will certainly go towards helping little Eric Markman.
"
Cartman,"Just bring out Elton John already!
"
M.C.,"Uh we're sorry, Elton couldn't make it. He- uh, he had to play at a cancer benefit.
"
Waitress,"It's all right, we got somebody better: Jimmy Buffett!
"
Cartman,"Jimmy Buffett?!
"
Jimmy Buffett,"Hello everyone. I wrote this song for a very brave little boy.
AIDSburger in paradise!
AIDSburger and it ain't nice!
"
Cartman,"Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
"
Jimmy Buffett,"A little boy in South Park
Dyin' of AIDS in the cold dark
How he got AIDS I haven't a clue.
Wastin' away again because of AIDS and stuff
How are we all feelin' tonight?
"
Cartman,"Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
"
Liane,"Ohoho poopsiekins, be nice.
"
Cartman,"Fuck you Mom, I have fucking AIDS!
"
Cartman,"Hey guys, thanks a lot for comin' to my AIDS benefit yesterday.
"
Stan,"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
"
Stan,"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
"
Cartman,"...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
"
Cartman,"No you don't!
"
Kyle,"I do. 
"
Cartman,"If you really felt bad, you'd wipe that fucking smirk off your face!  Well any God damned second, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 
"
Cartman,"Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
"
Stan,"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
"
Cartman,"Ironic how?
"
Stan,"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
"
Cartman,"Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
"
Stan,"Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
"
Cartman,"Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
"
Butters,"Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
"
Cartman,"All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
"
Butters,"Okay, but... what are you going to do?
"
Cartman,"Kyle thinks that HIV is funny, so we're gonna make him look funny, and then he'll know how it feels to be laughed at.
"
Butters,"I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
"
Cartman,"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
"
Butters,"I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
"
Cartman,"I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
"
Butters,"Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
"
Cartman,"All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
"
Butters,"Wow, you really know what you're doing.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
"
Kyle,"Wagh.
"
Sheila,"There there, bubbe, you'll be okay.  Oh doctor, did you find anything? Is it strep?
"
Dr. Doctor,"No, it isn't strep...
"
Sheila,"Oh, well there's a relief.
"
Dr. Doctor,"...Mrs. Broflovski, has your son ever had a blood transfusion?
"
Sheila,"No, why?
"
Dr. Doctor,"Little boy, have you been having unprotected anal sex?
"
Kyle,"What? No?!
"
Sheila,"Doctor, what are you saying?
"
Dr. Doctor,"We've run every test imaginable... little Kyle here is infected with HIV.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Sheila,"HIV?
"
Dr. Doctor,"It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.
"
Sheila,"No, that's impossible!
"
Dr. Doctor,"Little boy, are you sure you haven't taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice?
"
Kyle,"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
"
Sheila,"Kyle? Kyle!
"
Cartman,"Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
"
Kyle,"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Kyle, what?!
"
Stan,"What did he do?
"
Kyle,"Why do I have HIV?!
"
Clyde,"...Oh...
"
Cartman,"Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
"
Kyle,"What did you do?!
"
Cartman,"Nothing!
"
Kyle,"Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
"
Cartman,"Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 
"
Kyle,"Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
"
Cartman,"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
"
Kyle,"AAAAAAA! 
"
Cartman,"Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Here you go!  Here you go! 
"
Mr.Mackey,"Hey! Hey, that's enough! Break it up, m'kay?!  Break it up! Hm'kay?!  M'kay!
"
Principal Victoria,"All right, boys, now what is this fighting all about?
"
Kyle,"He gave me AIDS!
"
Principal Victoria,"What?
"
Kyle,"He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
"
Principal Victoria,"Is that true, Eric? Did you give Kyle AIDS?
"
Cartman,"Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
"
Principal Victoria,"Did you infect Kyle with the HIV virus, yes or no?!
"
Cartman,"Kind of.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric, that is not appropriate behavior, m'kay? You cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease!
"
Principal Victoria,"That's right. I think you owe Kyle an apology.
"
Cartman,"I'm sorry.
"
Kyle,"An apology?!
"
Principal Victoria,"You're sorry for what, Eric?
"
Cartman,"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
"
Principal Victoria,"That's better. And now Kyle, maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling.
"
Kyle,"...What?!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?
"
Kyle,"A tattle-tale?! He infected me with AIDS!
"
Cartman,"See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
"
Cartman,"Well Kyle, I guess we're even now. Shall we just call it a truce? Kyle? Shall we call it Even Stevens now?  Kyle, where are you going?
"
Kyle,"I'm going to break everything that you own! 
"
Cartman,"What's that supposed to mean? Kyle?  Kyle, no! I apologized, Kyle!
"
Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
"
Kyle,"There is no cure, you asshole!
"
Cartman,"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
"
Kyle,"What hope?!
"
Cartman,"Break my Xbox and you'll never know.
"
Kyle,"You're lying!
"
Cartman,"NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
"
Kyle,"Magic Johnson?
"
Cartman,"He was a basketball player.
"
Kyle,"So what?!
"
Cartman,"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
"
Kyle,"You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
"
Cartman,"My God...
"
Cartman,"We need two tickets to Los Angeles as soon as possible.
"
Clerk,"Los Angeles. Okay, uh I have a two o'clock flight. That would beee... $400 each.
"
Cartman,"Ah, sir, you don't understand. We have to see Magic Johnson right away. You see, we have AIDS.
"
Clerk,"...AIDS? Wow, that's really... retro. But ah I'm sorry. I- I just can't give away free seats.
"
Cartman,"Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
"
Kyle,"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
"
Clerk,"Oh, you boys are  like that, huh?
"
Kyle,"NO!
"
Clerk,"Are you sure you boys just don't have any cash?
"
Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
Clerk,"Uh, we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients, but AIDS I d-. Heh-hey Mitch? Do we have any AIDS patient policies?
"
Cartman,"Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 
"
Flight Attendant,"We're so happy to help accommodate you brave boys. What kind of cancer did you say you have again?
"
Cartman,"Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
"
Flight Attendant,"I'm so sorry
"
Cartman,"Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
"
Flight Attendant,"Hm, I don't know. These days I think I'd rather have AIDS than cancer.
"
Cartman,"No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
"
Kyle,"Don't. Touch me.
"
Cartman,"I know. I'm scared too.
"
Butler,"Magic. Magic, could you come to the front for a minute? There are a couple of boys here to see you. Two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across America to find the cure for AIDS. All they have are each other in a race against time. 
"
Kyle,"Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Johnson. We were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease.
"
Magic,"You boys both have the virus? Are you sure?
"
Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
Kyle,"Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
"
Cartman,"Kyle, we need to try to find a-
"
Kyle,"What part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny?!
"
Cartman,"I don't think it's funny, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Then stop saying you're not just sure, you're HIV-positive!  This isn't funny, AIDS isn't funny, dying isn't funny, so shut the fuck up!
"
Cartman,"Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
"
Kyle,"Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
"
Cartman,"Are you sure?
"
Kyle,"Yes!!
"
Cartman,"Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
"
Magic,"Boys, the truth is I don't know why my body is so resistant to the virus. I would love to know so I could help others, but I just don't. 
"
Kyle,"Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
"
Magic,"Well, not at all.
"
Magic,"The pool is over there , where I try to swim and stay in shape. My kitchen  is full of pretty healthy food. I don't know which thing it is that keeps my T-cell count high, so I... try it all.
"
Kyle,"But everyone tries that. There has to be something you're exposed to that others aren't. Could we see where you sleep?
"
Magic,"Sure.
"
Magic,"Just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom. 
"
Kyle,"Dude.
"
Magic,"Oh, oh yeah, I- I don't trust banks. I sleep with all my money.
"
Kyle,"You sleep with money. Every night?
"
Magic,"Yeah, I like to keep it close b- ...You don't think that..?
"
Scientist 1,"It's incredible. Mitch, these boys could be onto something. Take a look.  That's a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right?  All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash. 
"
Mitch,"My God. The HIV particles are receding! 
"
Scientist 1,"The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.
"
Scientist 2,"Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.
"
Kyle,"Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...
"
Mitch,"Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.
"
Magic,"I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!
"
Scientist 2,"Na-noo, it's ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I'm sorry, but this is impossible!
"
Magic,"These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen.  Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.
"
Scientist 2,"Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that's for sure.
"
Kyle,"Wugh.
"
Scientist 2,"I suppose we could try to distill Magic's cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it's very risky.
"
Cartman,"Yeah well, if there's a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.
"
Mitch,"Let's hope to Christ this works. 
"
Scientist 1,"Wait a minute... Yes... Yes, take a look!  The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle's blood!  Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.
"
Cartman,"All right!
"
Scientist 1,"They found the cure for AIDS!  The cure for AIDS!
"
Scientist 3,"What is it?
"
Scientist 1,"Large doses of concentrated cash!  Get the media on the phone!
"
Scientist 4,"All right!
"
Anchorman,"Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS.  About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.
"
Driver,"Hey! They just found the cure for AIDS! You just have to inject yourself with all your cash! Woohoo!
"
M.C.,"I am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the HIV virus in either Kyle Broflovski or Eric Cartman.  Together these boys beat their illness. With nothing but each other, and overcoming all odds , these two brave friends-
"
Kyle,"Oh stop! We're not friends! He's the one who infected me with AIDS!
"
M.C.,"These two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world. And so, to honor these boys , here is... Jimmy Buffett!
"
Cartman,"What?! Aw, no!
"
Jimmy Buffett,"Cureburger in paradise!
Cureburger. There I said it twice!
"
Cartman,"What?! Aw, God damn it!  Well I'll tell you this, Kyle. I'm never gettin' my tonsils out again, hahahaha.
"
Kyle,"I'm still breaking your Xbox. 
"
Cartman,"What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
"
Announcer,"Live, from Chicago, Illinois, it's Decision 2008.
"
Moderator,"Good evening and welcome to the political debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama.  First question: How do you see yourself as different from your opponent?
"
Stan,"Ugh, Dad, can we please not watch this?
"
Randy,"This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, but we totally don't.
"
Randy,"Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
"
Moderator,"And so, Mr. Obama, why don't you tell us your stance on military spending?
"
Barack Obama,"Well, my opinion is that-
"
Announcer,"We interrupt this debate for an emergency news bulletin! It's... Britney Watch!  Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
"
Butters,"Man...
"
Randy,"Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?
"
Anchorman,"Britney Spears has been spotted camping in the Colorado mountains, and one report claims that she has taken a piss... in the forest. Robert Pooner has more.
"
Robert Pooner,"Ron, I'm standing in South Mark, Colorado, where Britney Spears has apparently been trying to get away from it all. 
"
Cartman,"Aw dude, that's our town!
"
Robert Pooner,"Ms. Spears was spotted at a mountain campground , and you won't believe what she did, Ron. The troubled diva took a piss. Right on a ladybug. We've blurred out parts of the photo so that it doesn't offend. 
"
Randy,"She's such a train wreck!
"
Robert Pooner,"When the photo is enhanced, Ron, you can see the poor little ladybug getting doused. 
"
Ron,"This must be very embarrassing for Britney that this photo got out, Bob, and, and she looks like she's gained weight.
"
Robert Pooner,"That's right, Ron, she really chubbed up. And if you zoom in on her face, you can see that she's got some zits! 
"
Butters,"Aw, poor girl.
"
Randy,"Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. 
"
Ron,"The photograph was taken by Brian Willis of Bailey, Colorado , who sold it to 31 News for a hundred thousand dollars.
"
Kyle,"A hundred thousand dollars?
"
Cartman,"That's enough to buy slaves!
"
Ron,"Britney is said to be now hiding out in a South Park motel. Aand now back to the stupid Democratic debates.
"
Hillary Clinton,"...and spearchuckers.
"
Kyle,"Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
"
Stan,"And she's at a hotel in our town. 
"
Kyle,"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
"
Cartman,"Sweet!
"
Butters,"Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
"
Stan,"Butters, don't be such a pussy.
"
Butters,"Hokay. 
"
Kyle,"A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
"
Butters,"Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
"
Stan,"Oh no.
"
Kyle,"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
"
Photographer 1,"Join the club.
"
Photographer 2,"Yeah, all you amateur photographers are makin' this tougher on the professionals!
"
Cartman,"We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 
"
Guard,"Ah ah, nobody goes upstairs.
"
Kyle,"We uh, we have special permission?
"
Stan,"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
"
Guard,"You are?
"
Butters,"Not me! I'm a squirrel!
"
Britney,"But now everybody thinks I hate ladybugs. I didn't even know it was there. I can't take it anymore. I'm just sooo- 
"
Guard,"Excuse me, Ms. Spears, but your kids are here and they've brought you a squirrel.
"
Britney,"My boys? Really? Send them in.  It's okay. My kids are here. I feel better now. 
"
Kyle,"We did it guys!
"
Stan,"I told you that would work!
"
The Boys,"Yehehahah, all right!
"
Kyle,"Ahall right!
"
Britney,"You mean, it was just a joke? My kids ain't here?
"
Kyle,"All right. Butters, go get next to her.
"
Butters,"I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
"
Stan,"Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
"
Britney,"You're never gonna leave me alone, are you?
"
Butters,"It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
"
Kyle,"All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
"
Stan,"Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
"
Cartman,"All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
"
Britney,"I've got a better idea.
"
Stan,"You do?
"
Britney,"Yeah. 
"
"Stan, Kyle","NO! 
"
Butters,"You killed her! 
"
Guard,"Hey, everything all right u-. Oh.
"
Nurse,"Paging Dr. Bender? Paging Dr. Bender, please? 
"
Stan,"We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
"
Kyle,"How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
"
Doctor,"She's... alive.
"
Kyle,"Whew.
"
Stan,"Oh, thank God.
"
Doctor,"But, we almost lost her. Why couldn't you boys just leave her alone?
"
Kyle,"Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
"
Doctor,"I don't want you making her upset.
"
Stan,"We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
"
Doctor,"All right.
"
Doctor,"Ms. Spears, these boys wanted to say something. 
"
Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
Stan,"Oh no!
"
Doctor,"The boys are just shocked at how good you look, Britney.  Right, boys?!
"
Kyle,"Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
"
Doctor,"Well, I'll let you boys have your say. 
"
Stan,"Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
"
Kyle,"Oh, God, what have we done?!
"
Announcer,"It's Britney Watch! Keeping you up-to-date with all your Britney Spears news!
"
Reporter,"You won't believe what Britney's done now. The troubled pop star has just been spotted with a crazy ""no top part of my head"" look. This video  was taken just hours ago as Britney was wheeled into the hospital for some reason. And if we zoom in on the footage, right, ri-right here , you can also definitely see a boob job scar. No doubt now that she's had plastic surgery in the past.
"
Anchorman,"O ho ho, oh houch, that's gotta be embarrassing. Chris, any word on why Ms. Spears went for this radical ""no top of the head"" look?
"
Chris,"No word yet, Tom, but it could be over the embarrassment of the boob job scar video we showed just, just now. Uh, even though the timing doesn't quite work out.
"
Kyle,"Dude! 
"
Doctor,"Damn it, she can't handle any stress right now!
"
Manager,"Excuse me, I'm Britney Spears' manager.  Oh, jeez, Britney! Britney, what were ya thinkin'? First you shave your head and now this.
"
Britney,"Guglo.
"
Manager,"Well, it's a ballsy new look, I'll give you that.
"
Paparazzo,"Brit! Over here, Brit. One for Star Weekly. 
"
Doctor,"Damn it you have to take her out of here; she can't be around all this right now.
"
Britney,"Right. We need to take her home. Boys, can you give me a hand with her?
"
Stan,"Yeah, of course. 
"
Manager,"Okay, come on!  My car is right here. 
"
Photographer 3,"Hey look!
"
Photographer 4,"There she is! 
"
Kyle,"Oh crap! 
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
Manager,"Yeah yeah, it's like this all the time.  Thank you! Yes, thanks. 
"
Stan,"Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
"
Manager,"That's great, boys. Britney seems to have really taken a liking to you. And don't worry: Britney is a queen at reinventing herself. We just need to get her into the recording studio right away.
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Manager,"All right, Britney, let's take it from the top. Remember to bring that sexiness to it.
"
Kyle,"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
"
Sound Engineer,"All right, Brit, let's try it from the top. 
"
Female Aide,"God, what a train wreck.
"
Male Aide,"She must be stoned again. 
"
Stan,"Would you put a stop to this, please? This is only gonna make things worse.
"
Manager,"Whattaya mean? She sounds great.  Ah, Britney, that last lyric is supposed to be ""love elation"". Sounds more like you're saying ""love creation"".
"
Britney,"Gogehah.
"
Manager,"E-la-tion. Really enunciate the L.
"
Britney,"Egeul-gageol
"
Sound Engineer,"Gah, she's so stupid.
"
Stan,"What do you expect?! Look at her! She doesn't have most of her brain!
"
Sound Engineer,"I know. She's really dumb, huh? 
"
Stan,"No, I mean, she literally doesn't have most of her brain! Her head is gone!
"
Sound Engineer,"Yeah. And she's all fat, too.
"
Britney,"Okel?
"
Announcer,"Live, from Las Vegas, it's the MTV Video Music Awards
"
VJ,"What's up, y'all? It's the MTV Awards and we are kickin' it off right. Here to perform her new song is the one, and only, Britney Spears! 
"
Kyle,"Aw come on now, people! 
"
Woman,"Oh my God, she's really gotten chubby. 
"
Singers,"The way she fee-els.  Love inside.
"
Man,"Oh man, she's totally lip-syncing.
"
Stan,"She doesn't have any lips!
"
Singers,"Temporary.  So hot! 
"
Reporter,"Disaster at the MTV awards. People are ridiculing Britney Spears. Her performance was awful, Tom. She looked tired, she looked fat, she didn't have a head. It was just completely phoned in. No doubt, Tom, that girl has major issues.
"
Manager,"Don't listen to 'em, Brit! They're all just jealous. And we can put you on SlimFast tomorrow.  Hang on, hang on, she'll be out in a minute. 
"
Stan,"We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
"
Kyle,"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
"
Stan,"I know where.
"
Stan,"We want three tickets to the North Pole. 
"
Clerk,"The North Pole?  Who the hell goes to the North Pole?
"
Stan,"We do. Me, my friend, and his aunt. 
"
Announcer,"It's Britney Wowtch!
"
Ron,"A distraught Britney Spears has apparently disappeared and abandoned all those close to her. A local housewife caught a photo of Britney running away in this disguise! 
"
Robert Pooner,"Britney is obviously very upset about her MTV performance, Ron, and so she's become desperate. Most troubling for her is the fact that her disguise has total camel toe. 
"
Ron,"Oooooh, ouch!
"
Anchorwoman,"Oh boy, now, Leslie, this seems like a really bad camel toe offense.
"
Leslie,"Absolutely major camel toe, Tracy. Britney just seems oblivious. She was bound to get noticed: you walk around with that kind of cam toe and you're gonna turn heads.
"
Ron,"Eh, David, any idea as to how big the camel toe actually was? 
"
Robert Pooner,"She was sportin' toe like never before, Brian. I, I don't know what's wrong with that girl, but, it's a slap in the face to camels all over the planet.
"
Ron,"Those close to Britney say they are very worried and want to bring her home safe. And now back to the local news.
"
Tracy,"The giant squirrel which was picked up last week by animal control apparently now thinks it's a person. Colorado officials have taken the squirrel to Johns-Hopkins for psychiatric evaluation.
"
Ron,"Hm, that squirrel is obviously nuts.
"
Kyle,"Platform 4F. Uhhh, it must be on the other side of the station.
"
Paparazzo,"There she is! It's Britney! 
"
Stan,"Oh no. 
"
Stan,"Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
"
Kyle,"Yes they are! I have an idea.
"
Paparazzo 2,"Britney? Where'd she go?
"
Paparazzo 3,"There she is! 
"
Stan,"It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 
"
Manager,"There she is. Hey Britney, it's me.  Britney. It's over. What were you runnin' for anyway?
"
Reporter,"Hey, wait a minute. Where's her camel toe?!
"
Kyle,"I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
"
Paparazzo 5,"Ooo, psych!
"
Manager,"She must be back at the train station; come on! 
"
Kyle,"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
"
Paparazzo 6,"Son, you don't seem to understand. Britney Spears... has to die.
"
Kyle,"Huh? 
"
Paparazzo 7,"What do you think all this effort has been for?
"
Manager,"It cannot be stopped. The purpose is too great.
"
Officer,"She must... die.
"
Background Singers,"Hetus. Alte omnebus.  Virtu e poquebus. 
"
Narrator,"Little Stanley was tired and hungry. But he knew that for Britney Spears to be safe, he had to get her to the North Pole.
"
Stan,"You doing okay, Ms. Spears? 
"
Conductor,"It's her. Um no, I'm sure it's Britney Spears;  it looks just like the picture.  You want me to, to what? Yes, I understand.  Rectus. Hoc honebus
"
Elderly Man,"Hello, I'm Bob Summers, so happy you picked our little town.
"
Kyle,"What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
"
Bob Summers,"Well nobody wants her to die, little boy. We all simply... need her to. Do you understand?
"
Kyle,"NO!
"
Paparazzo 8,"Look, kid, throughout history people have found it necessary to engage in... human sacrifice.
"
Bob Summers,"In ancient times, humans would commonly pick one lovely girl, adorn her with jewels, treat her like a goddess, and then... watch her die.
"
Paparazzo 9,"We like to think we're more civilized now, but the truth is our lust for torture and death is no different than it was in gladidator times.
"
Paparazzo 10,"Only difference is that now we like to watch people put to death through magazines and photographs.
"
Canadian Paparazzo,"It's a damn shame too. Old ways were bettah. Used to be we just picked someone by lottery and then stoned them to death.
"
Woman,"Stonin' to death was too violent. Rather have the sacrifice kill itself.
"
Kyle,"You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
"
Man,"Britney was chosen a long time ago, to be built up and adored, and then sacrificed. For harvest.
"
Paparazzo 11,"All right, everyone's about here.
"
Kyle,"Who's everyone?! Who all is in on this?!
"
Male passenger,"Hey, where are we? This isn't right. 
"
Stan,"Oh no!
"
Britney,"Ohhh thoooo!
"
Stan,"Come on, Britney!  Come on, come on! 
"
Kyle,"Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
"
Gerald,"It's okay, Kyle. Just... be a good boy.
"
Kyle,"Be a good boy? You know all about this?
"
Stan,"Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
"
Kyle,"She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
"
Stan,"Sacrificed? For what?
"
Randy,"For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
"
Canadian Paparazzo,"Sacrifice in March, corn have plenty starch.
"
Kyle,"Corn harvest!
"
Randy,"We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
"
Stan,"All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
"
Manager,"The kid is right. This has gone on too long.
"
Paparazzo 12,"Yeah. She was supposed to have killed herself a long time ago.
"
Farmer,"And harvest is coming soon.
"
Bob Summers,"All right, folks, let's finish this quickly. 
"
Stan,"No wait. 
"
Woman 2,"Come on, hurry up.
"
Woman 3,"I can't run. You go ahead, I'll catch up with ya. 
"
Mother,"Here Davey. 
"
Bob Summers,"Hold on. 
"
Doctor,"She's dead.
"
Randy,"Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 
"
Gil,"Mornin' Bill.
"
Bill,"Mornin' Gil.
"
Gil,"Nice-lookin' corn.
"
Sheila,"Hey Sharon, Randy, great harvest, huh? 
"
Randy,"An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
"
ET Reporter,"She's the daughter of a country singer, and the young girl has really taken the country by storm. Hannah Montana's Miley Cyrus, though only fifteen years old, is already on her way to being a major superstar.
"
Jimbo,"Hey, check it out! 
"
Randy,"Looks like next harvest will be even better. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it ""The Choking Game"", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?
"
Kyle,"You can get high from choking yourself? 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?
"
Butters,"Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
"
Cartman,"Cat pee? 
"
Stan,"That's not true. You can't get high off of cat urine, can you?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.
"
Cartman,"All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
"
Kyle,"You guys are wasting your time.
"
Stan,"Yeah, this is not gonna work.
"
Cartman,"Okay, ready Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(All set.)
"
Cartman,"All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 
"
Kenny,"(Ow.)
"
Kyle,"Whoa! 
"
Stan,"Do you feel anything?
"
Cartman,"Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 
"
Kenny,"(Hey cool! Check it out!)
"
Father,"I see that you're enticed by my daughter's awesome rocking tits.
"
Kenny,"(Yeahhh!)
"
Father,"Then bathe with my daughter in the fountain of Varnov. Appease the gods by lathering her boobs with soapy suds.
"
Kenny,"(Okay.) 
"
Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
"
Kenny,"(What?)  (Where'd she go?) 
"
Cartman,"Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
"
Kenny,"(You fucking asshole!)
"
Cartman,"Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
"
Kenny,"(What the fuck did you do that for?)
"
Cartman,"Ah, Kenny! 
"
Kyle,"Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
"
Kenny,"(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)
"
Stan,"What titties?
"
Kenny,"(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
"
Kyle,"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
"
Stan,"Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
"
Kenny,"(I almost... touched them.)
"
Kyle,"Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
"
Announcer,"Next on FOX News!  It's the newest drug craze. and it's killing your kids! 
"
Gerald,"Killing our kids? 
"
Reporter,"All over America, kids are getting high... on cat urine!  Huffing cat urine apparently causes a euphoric state  and is also referred to as... cheesing.  Why ""cheesing""? Because it's ""fon to due"".  This sixth grade girl said she's been snorting cat piss for several months.
"
Girl,"We sometimes sneak out during recess and a friend named _________ goes and gets her cats, and we'll just cheese all day long.
"
Gerald,"Oh my God! Sheila! Come look at this!
"
Reporter,"So how can you tell if your child is cheesing? 
1. Your child seems distant, preoccupied.
2. Your child's face smells like cat urine.
3. When you see tigers at the zoo, your child starts grinding his or her teeth.
You might also notice by certain phrases your child says to school friends, such as ""Hey, let's go cheese."" or ""Do you feel like cheesing, guys?"" or ""Dude, I'm cheesing my F-ing brains out right now.""
"
Sheila,"Kids are doing this?
"
Reporter,"Kids do it because it's legal.  What can you do before it's too late? 
"
Gerald,"We have to protect our children from this, Sheila.
"
Gerald,"Twenty percent of American students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once. Kids also refer to it as ""the cheese game"", or ""vitamin cheese"", or ""Mary Jane piss in your face fun time"". Cheesing is spreading fast.
"
Sharon,"All right, we're all sufficiently scared, Gerald, but what could we do?
"
Gerald,"I have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of South Park.
"
Stephen,"Gerald's right. We all have to face it. Cats are deadly animals! If you stick your nose up their crotch and snort their piss, they can kill you!
"
Gerald,"With my super lawyer powers, we can rid our town of cats, so that our kids can never get high again!
"
Randy,"Let's hear it for Gerald!
"
Stephen,"Hooray for Gerald! 
"
Ruby Tucker,"No! No!
"
Agent 1,"Oh wah wah! Get over it, druggie.  Jeez... 
"
Girl 2's Father,"Goodbye, Scrambles.  We'll miss you. 
"
Agent 2,"Got two here.
"
Kenny,"(Hey! What the hell are you doing?!)
"
Agent 1,"Sorry, these are illegal.
"
Kenny,"(What?! No! What are you doing?!)  (You fuckers!) 
"
Cartman,"Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
"
Kyle,"Guys, have you seen Kenny?
"
Stan,"Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, and he was out sick yesterday too. Guys...  I think Kenny isn't here because he's at home cheesing.
"
Butters,"Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
"
Stan,"Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, who has cats these days? 
"
Kyle,"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
"
Kenny,"(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)
"
Kyle,"Kenny? 
"
Stan,"Kenny, you home? 
"
Kenny,"(Wooooooooo! Woo! Wazzup? Wazzup?) 
"
Kyle,"Kenny!
"
Kenny,"(Wazzup? Ho-Ho! Wooooooo!)
"
Butters,"Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
"
"Stan, Kyle","Kenny!
"
Butters,"There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
"
Kyle,"Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
"
Kenny,"(No we don't, guys.)
"
Stan,"Yes, we do. We're your friends, dude. We're not gonna let you ruin your life.
"
Kenny,"(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)
"
Kyle,"Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
"
Butters,"Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
"
Stan,"Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
"
Kenny,"(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
"
Butters,"Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
"
Kyle,"We've gotta keep this away from him.
"
Cartman,"Mr. Kitty, shhh!  Damn it!  Shhh, Mr. Kitty you have to be quiet, or else they're gonna find you.  What?!  It's the neighbor cat. He hasn't been caught yet.  No- no, Mr. Kitty. I know you like Rufus, but he has to fend for himself.  I can't hide anymore cats, Mr. Kitty.  I'm in trouble enough as it is.  All right, all right, fine. 
"
Cartman,"All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 
"
Sheila,"Huh?  Oh my God... 
"
Gerald,"Kyle! Kyle, can we talk to you for a minute, please?
"
Kyle,"Yeah?
"
Gerald,"Kyle, have you been getting high?!
"
Kyle,"No.
"
Gerald,"Then why did your mother find this  in your dresser drawer?!
"
Kyle,"All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
"
Sheila,"Don't lie to us, Kyle!
"
Gerald,"How long have you been on the cheese?!
"
Kyle,"I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
"
Gerald,"Get up to your room right now until your mother and I figure out how to deal with this!
"
Kyle,"Dad, will you just listen to me for a second?
"
Gerald,"Now, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"God! 
"
Sheila,"Gerald, what are we gonna do? Our son is a cat pee addict!
"
Gerald,"First thing is we've gotta dispose of this!
"
Sheila,"What are you gonna do?
"
Gerald,"I'd better just... take it down to the basement for now, m-make sure Kyle can't find it. 
"
Gerald,"No. No, what am I thinking? I shouldn't do this.  I've been clean for ten... years. I haven't even been near a cat.  But then that report said our kids were doing it too, and... and I knew Kyle would have the same sicknesses I used to have... Now a cat is in our home, and it's too tempting.  I... I'll just do it one more time.  One. Last. Time.  Then I'll call the police; have them pick up the cat.  And then I'll never do it again.  After this one... last... time... 
"
Gerald,"I couldn't stay away. Curse your rockin' tits!
"
Cartman,"Who is it?!
"
Woman,"Please! Open the door.  They say you are hiding cats.
"
Cartman,"Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 
"
Woman,"You don't understand  My little Nishka,  She has nowhere else to go.
"
Cartman,"Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
"
Woman,"But they will find him.
"
Cartman,"I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
"
Woman,"Oh, you show such kindness in such darkest of times. 
"
Cartman,"What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
"
Kenny,"(Woooooh! Woooooh!) 
"
Cartman,"Aw, crap- Kenny!  Bad. Kitties.
"
Kyle,"Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
"
Stan,"Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
"
Cartman,"He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Stan,"He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
"
Kyle,"What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
"
Cartman,"They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 
"
Stan,"Come on, we've gotta find Kenny before he hurts himself.
"
Kyle,"I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
"
Gerald,"Hey everybody. Good to see you again. 
"
Father,"Hold! You cannot yet caress my daughter's awesome boobage!
"
Gerald,"Huh... how come?
"
Father,"There is... another suitor. 
"
Gerald,"What?  Get out of here, kid!
"
Kenny,"(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)
"
Gerald,"You're too young for this stuff!
"
Father,"This must be decided at the Breastriary in Nippopolis! 
"
Father,"Now fight for the Loc-Nar trophy! 
"
Kyle,"Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
Jimbo,"They've been goin' at it for a good thirty minutes.
"
Gerald,"She's mine, you little asshole!
"
Kenny,"(Get the fuck off of me!)
"
Sheila,"Gerald?!
"
Reporter,"The key proponent of the cat ban has been charged with cheesing in a public park. Gerald Broflovski is prepared to give a public statement.
"
Gerald,"I would like to address a personal matter: I have let myself down. And I would first like to apologize to my lovely wife.
"
Sheila,"Don't touch me.
"
Gerald,"And to the people of South Park.  I was wrong, and I can't let cats take the fall anymore. It's our fault. The people who use cats for their sweet urine.  We have to learn that cheesing just isn't worth it. Sure, you get to fight in the Breastriary, and swim in the Fountains of Varnov with the Itty Titty Fairies of Mammary Mountain.
"
Stan,"What the hell is he talking about?
"
Kyle,"I have no idea.
"
Gerald,"And then you fight the Boob Goblin in the Gazongas Cave, and then the girl may thank you for it. But she. Isn't. Real.
"
Randy,"And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 
"
Gerald,"Problem is, the more you into that world, the more you need to go. Until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you. 
"
Kenny,"(Yeah. I guess so.)
"
Gerald,"Cats aren't the problem. We made cats illegal and and then I cheesed for the first time in ten years. And kids are always gonna find a new way to get high. Like sniffing glue or licking toads, or fermenting feces or huffing paint. You can also look at-
"
Stephen,"Uh okay, that's probably good, Gerald.
"
Gerald,"The point is, I was wrong. Its time to legalize cats!  Heh yeah! Hooray for Gerald! Hey, let's hear it for Gerald! 
"
Girl 2's Father,"Scrambles! So good to have you back! You ain't sore at us, are ya?  Ahh! Get him off! 
"
Stan,"I'm sure glad that's over with. 
"
Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
Cartman,"But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
"
Kyle,"And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
"
Cartman,"Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
"
Stan,"You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
"
Kyle,"Yeah.  He's getting... really high on life. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
"
Kyle,"Kenny! 
"
Stan,"What the hell kind of flowers are those?
"
Kyle,"Kenny? Kenny?!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.
"
Cartman,"Oh God, I'm bored already.
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, so we've been asked to show you a video from the World Canadian Bureau. Uh start the tape please? 
"
WCB President,"Hello, I am Stephen Abootman, President of the World Canadian Bureau. Do you ever stop to think how important Canada is to the world? Right now, I would like all students of Canadian descent in this school to stand up.  Just look at all these fine Canadians in your school. See how diverse they are. When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?
"
Cartman,"Gayness! 
"
Stephen Abootman,"That's right: spirit! What is it that makes Canada so important?
"
Craig,"Nothing! 
"
Stephen Abootman,"My fellow Canadians, for too long we have been pushed around, and ridiculed! Yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding! Instead, Canada Appreciation Day was mocked worldwide! 
"
Man 1,"Nobody takes us Canadians seriousleh!
"
Lumberjack,"It's like the world doesn't respect Canada at all, eh?
"
Stephen Abootman,"That's right! And I think it's time for Canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it! Together we can send a message! It's time for Canada ...to strike!
"
Woman 1,"Did you say strike?
"
Stephen Abootman,"Yes! Every Canadian join me! Join together!
"
Man 2,"Canada, on strike.
"
Man 3,"Canada, on strike.
"
Canadians,"Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Canadaaa! Caaanaaadaaa!
Canada on strike! Canada says ""No more!""
No more neglect! We want respect! That's what we're striking for!
All you bureaucrats and corporate cats
"
Border Guard,"Can all just take a hike! 
"
Canadians,"It's Canaada! On Strike!
Canada on strike! From Vancouver to St. John's ,
We raise our middle fingers for you all to sit upon!
And with our fingers up your ass,
you won't be very psyched
It's Canada! On Strike!
And we will not bow a bunch! Our resolve is strong!
We even took three hours to rehearse this striking song! 
Canada on strike! No matter where you are,
If you are Canadian then you've got to do your part!
March out of the halls!
"
Café 180 Patron,"That's right, suck my Canadian balls!
It's Canada! On Strike!
"
Canadians,"It's Canada! Canada! Canada! On Strike!
"
Swiss Delegate,"Ahhh, when you say ""Canada is on strike"", what exactly do you mean?
"
Stephen Abootman,"What do you think it means?!  We're striking, buddih! No more! That's it! Until we get what we want
"
French Delegate,"Who exactly are you to authorize this strike?
"
Stephen Abootman,"I'm Stephen Abootman! Leader of the WGA!
"
French Delegate,"The WGA?
"
Stephen Abootman,"Yes! The World Canadian Bureau! 
"
French Delegate,"What exactly does Canada want?
"
Stephen Abootman,"We want: more... money!
"
Aide 1,"Yeah! More money!
"
Japanese Delegate,"More money from where?
"
Stephen Abootman,"Just more money! You know! Canada doesn't get enough money! Other countries have lots of money; we want, we want some of that money! Hu- how about- the Internet? The Internet makes lots of money! So give us some of that money!
"
Aide 1,"Yeah! Give us Internet money!
"
British Delegate,"A Mister A- Abootman, you seem to- not understand how ...global economics works. I think that-
"
Stephen Abootman,"Don't give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling! Are you gonna give Canada more money or not?! 
"
British Delegate,"I'm afraid we can't.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Then you leave Canada no choice.  This strike shall continue! 
"
Husband,"""Honk if you support Canada"" He- hey honey, watch this. 
"
Wife,"Oh, we're supporting unions.
"
Husband,"That's right; we're a very progressive couple.
"
Wife,"Yes.  Oh, that's fun!
"
Husband,"Well we've done our good deed for the week. I think now I can make love to your anus without making God angry.
"
Wife,"Oh really? Goodie! 
"
Kyle,"Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
"
Cartman,"We don't care. *urp*
"
Kyle,"You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
"
Stan,"Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!
"
Butters,"Yippie!
"
Announcer,"It's the Terrance and Phillip Show.  Today's episode: I Fart Huckabees. 
"
Butters,"Aww, this one again?!
"
Stan,"God, they've replayed this one like eighty times now!
"
Terrance,"Say Phillip, I just bought this new hybrid car.
"
Phillip,"Oh? Does it run on electricity?
"
Terrance,"No, it uses natural gas. 
"
Phillip,"Not as fat as your face!
"
Butters,"Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
"
Cartman,"God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
"
Kyle,"There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
"
Stan,"It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 
"
Peter Griffin,"You think that's bad? Remember the time I sang ""La Cucaracha"" for Paul McCartney?
"
Cartman,"No! NOOO!
"
Peter Griffin,"La Cucaracha-  We are NOT... resorting to that!
"
Canadians,"We want more! We want more!
"
Stephen Abootman,"One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! One, two, three, four, Canada deserves more (money)! 
"
Terrance,"Look, buddih, me and Phillip need to go home for a bit.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Go home?! You can't leave the picket line!
"
Terrance,"But this is taking too long, and Phillip is diabetic.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Look, guy, we are to stay strong! If you don't stand with your fellow Canadians, then you are a rat!
"
Terrance,"Don't call me a rat, buddih!
"
Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your buddih, friend!
"
Phillip,"He's not your friend, guy!
"
Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your guy, buddih!
"
Terrance,"He's not your buddih, friend!
"
Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your friend, guy!  Don't you two understand anything?! You think striking is a joke?! You think it's something to ridicule?!
"
Weird Hat Guy,"Yah, you think this is funnih?
"
Stephen Abootman,"Don't you see that we have to stand together or else we have nothing?!
"
Aide 1,"Stephen! Stephen! A call came in from the United States! They want to talk to you aboot ending the strike!
"
Stephen Abootman,"What did I tell you?! I told you we'd get to them sooner or later!  Shh, shh, quiet everyone! Let me handle this.  Yes. This is Stephen Abootman, head of the WGA.
"
Kyle,"Uh, hi, we want you to end this strike. 
"
Stephen Abootman,"Oh you do, huh?!  They've had enough. They want us to end the strike.  Quiet, quiet, shh, shh, sh- quiet, quiet! Let me deal with this.  All right, we're prepared to end this strike! If you are agreeing that we should have more monihhh!
"
Kyle,"We totally think you should have more money.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Wwe got 'em! We did it!  All right, how much are you gonna give us?
"
Kyle,"Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Oh, negotiating hardball, are we?! What about all that Internet money?!
"
Kyle,"The Internet?
"
Stephen Abootman,"You listen to me, friend!  You'd better figure out a way to get us our fair amount of money, and until you come back with a solid fair number, I'm finished talking to you, you slimy corporate dickhead!  Don't worry, don't worry. This is how negotiating works. This is good. We've got 'em by the balls.
"
Stan,"What'd they say?
"
Kyle,"They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
"
Cartman,"How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
"
Butters,"Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
"
Kyle,"We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
"
Cartman,"Wait. I've got it.
"
Butters,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
"
A Nun,"Oh my.
"
Butters,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
"
Cartman,"There's more people viewing it!
"
Stan,"This is going great!
"
Kyle,"Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
"
Tom,"And in other world news, the leader of Japan today is calling for an increase in military spending.
"
Aide 1,"How come they never mention anything about us?! When are they gonna get to the strike?!
"
Stephen Abootman,"Don't worry, the strike is big news. I'm sure it will be one of the top stories.
"
Tom,"In other news tonight, it the Internet video that has already seen over ten million views. A young confused-looking boy dancing and singing a song called ""What What (In My Asshole)"".
"
Reporter,"Tom, in just one week the video has become the most watched thing in all of America.  The boy in the video, referred to by most as ""that little gay kid"",  has already been asked to appear on Jimmy Kimmel and The Today Show.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Aw damn it that's not news! What about us?!
"
Phillip,"Look, ah, Stephen, Terrance and I were talking andeh, well it's, it's starting to look like maybe we're not gonna win this thing, you know?
"
Stephen Abootman,"We'll win! We'll just have to stay resilient!
"
Phillip,"Wull, yeah, but everyone is dying of starvation.
"
Terrance,"Yeah, let's give it up, guy.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Don't call me your guy! I'm not your guy, friend!
"
Terrance,"Well I'm not your friend, buddih!
"
Stephen Abootman,"Well I'm not your buddih, guy!
"
Woman 2,"Wait! Here it is! Turn it up! We're on!
"
Tom,"And finally tonight, a new development in the Canada strike. For those of you who don't remember or don't care, Canada has been striking for more money. 
"
Stephen Abootman,"All right! Shh! I told you, I told you, listen, listensh, listen listen listen.
"
Tom,"In a shocking turn of events, it now appears that thousands of people from Denmark are flooding into the United States with hopes of taking the place of the striking Canadians.
"
Stephen Abootman,"What?
"
Female Reporter,"Do you really think you Danish can replace the Canadians?
"
Danish Man,"Well, where we come from it's pretty cold too, ja. We like hockey and nobody really pays any attention to us.
"
Danish Woman,"Nobody knows where Denmark is.
"
Danish Man,"Right. So when you think about it, we're the Canadians of Europe.
"
Stephen Abootman,"SCABS! How could you?! 
"
Stan,"Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
"
Clerk,"Take a number and wait with everyone else.
"
Cartman,"Ma'am, perhaps you don't recognize the Internet sensation Little Gay Kid from YouToob.
"
Clerk,"Take a number and wait with everyone else! 
"
Black Man,"Chocolate Raaain.
"
Butters,"Aaah. 
"
Tron Guy,"Hey, I know you. You're the ""What What (In My Asshole)"" kid.
"
Butters,"""What What (In The Butt),"" sir.
"
Stan,"It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
"
Tron Guy,"Yeah, sure. All the biggest Internet stars are here. You remember, of course, Numa Numa. 
"
Numa Numa,"Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyaho, Ma-iyaha ha
"
Tron Guy,"And the Star Wars kid.  And the Internet sensation Cute Sneezing Panda.  And there's Dramatic Look Gopher. 
"
Cartman,"Wow, I've seen all you guys on the Internet!
"
Chocolate Rain Guy,"So, how many people have seen your Internet video?
"
Butters,"Uhhh a few hundred thousand?
"
Chocolate Rain Guy,"Huh, mere peanuts. Chocolate Rain has done gangbusters. Theoretically, I'm a millionaire.
"
Cartman,"Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
"
Chris Crocker,"Leave Chocolate Rain Guy alone! Leave him alohohone! I'm serious! 
"
Kyle,"Excuse me.  Hello?
"
Stephen Abootman,"You greedy corporate fat cat. You said you would get us moneh.
"
Kyle,"Wait we're working on it.
"
Stephen Abootman,"You're stalling! Because you think I'll give up. You know that most Canadians are talkin' about giving up the strike already.  You've got me over a barrel and you know it!
"
Kyle,"Sir, we're doing everything we can.
"
Stephen Abootman,"You want me to say it again?! You've got me over a barrel! There, you happy?! You've got me bent over a barrel with my tender ass just waiting to be pulverized by your thrusting manhood!  Do you realize how stupid I'm going to look if I call off the strike after starting all this?! I won't do it! You hear me, guy?! You're wrong! No matter what happens I will never call of this strike! Even if it means we all. Die.
"
Kyle,"We don't want you to die.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Then you'd better hurry. We don't have much longer. The blood will be on your hands. 
"
Kyle,"We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
"
Chocolate Rain Guy,"I don't think so. Nothing takes priority over Chocolate Rain.
"
Star Wars Kid,"Oh, here he goes with the ego again. Who crowned you the top Internet star?!
"
Chocolate Rain Guy,"I did. When I became bigger than all you bitches.
"
Tron Guy,"Oh please, Laughing Baby had four times as many views as you! 
"
Chocolate Rain Guy,"You'd better shut your fuckin' mouth, Laughin' Baby!
"
Afro Ninja,"Did you all forget about Afro Ninja? My Internet thing was bigger than anybody's. I made over a hundred million theoretical dollars.
"
Star Wars Kid,"Well Sneezing Panda is theoretically worth billions!
"
Chocolate Rain Guy,"You all wanna motherfuckin' die?! 
"
Chris Crocker,"NOOO! 
"
Numa Numa Guy,"Haw!
"
Kyle,"Okay, forget it. We'll wait our turn.
"
Tron Guy,"Hai Hayaaa!
"
Numa Numa,"Ma-iyahi Ma-iyahu Ma-iyah- 
"
Chris Crocker,"Leave Tron Guy alone! Leave him alone! 
"
Chocolate Rain Guy,"Get ready for some chocolate pain, bitch! 
"
Chris Crocker,"Leave the panda alone! Leave her alone, I'm serious! 
"
Chocolate Rain Guy,"Thought I forgot about you, Gopher?!  Ughhh, my brains. 
"
Cartman,"Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
"
Aide 1,"Stephen!, Stephen! They're here! They've come to negotiate!
"
Stephen Abootman,"What?! You mean it?! 
"
Kyle,"Okay, we did it.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Who the hell are you?
"
Stan,"We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
"
Kyle,"Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
"
Stephen Abootman,"Theoretical dollars? What am I supposed to do with that?!  You little timewasters!
"
Stan,"Hey, we worked really hard to get this theoretical money!
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
"
Cartman,"...You are a homo, Butters.
"
Kyle,"Dude, will you just end this thing now?! My little brother is gonna die!
"
Stephen Abootman,"Nooooo! I'm not gonna look like an idiot! If I fucked up and led everyone astray, the last thing I'm going to do and admit it!  Yes, this is the head of the WGA. The World Canadian Bureau.
"
Swiss Delegate,"Ah, Mr. Abootman. It's the global world summit leaders. We want to talk to you about the strike.
"
Stephen Abootman,"You... You do? You wanna negotiate?!
"
French Delegate,"No, actually we were just wondering if, when you're all dead, we can use Newfoundland for a new global theme park. 
"
Kyle,"Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
"
Swiss Delegate,"Excuse me?
"
Kyle,"He just doesn't wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!
"
French Delegate,"Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize
"
Kyle,"If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
"
Stephen Abootman,"Will they... act like they're giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?
"
Kyle,"Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
"
Swiss Delegate,"Sure, why not?
"
Stephen Abootman,"We have won! 
"
Lumberjack,"Well how much did we get?
"
Stephen Abootman,"Well, we uh, we didn't get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these...  coupons to Bennigan's! And...  free bubblegum... for every Canadian.  These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan's. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.
"
Aide 1,"We did it! 
"
Stephen Abootman,"My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. 
"
Kyle,"Ike. Ike!  It's over.
"
Ike,"It's over?
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Here you go. 
"
Stan,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
Butters,"Me too!
"
Kyle,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
"
Stan,"...Yeah.
"
Stephen Abootman,"Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo! 
"
Terrance,"Hold on a minute! Wait just a second!  We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!
"
Phillip,"And our Bennigan's coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!
"
Stephen Abootman,"Don't look at that. Come on, friends, let's dance.
"
Phillip,"You had no idea what you were doing and now you're trying to make it look like you won so that we won't set you adrift!
"
Stephen Abootman,"Damn it friends, don't you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn't get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada's respect. 
"
Stephen Abootman,"Eh?! What do you think you're doing?!
"
Terrance,"We're setting you adrift, idiot!
"
Phillip,"Maybe you can go live with the Danish!
"
Stephen Abootman,"You'll regret this day, friend!
"
Phillip,"I'm not your friend, buddih!
"
Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your buddih, guy!
"
Terrance,"He's not your guy, friend!
"
Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your friend, buddih!
"
Terrance & Phillip,"We're not your buddih, guy!
"
Stephen Abootman,"I'm not your guy, friend!
"
Mrs. Garrison,"It's like, my whole life has just been one big screw-up, you know?  I admit it, I was I was sexually lost. I was, and then I see this person on Oprah. She was a woman but then she got a sex change, became a man, but... then she got pregnant and is having a baby, which means she's still a woman all along. That means I'm really still a man, I'm... I still feel like a man
"
Butters,"Are we gonna get tested on this?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"This sex change was a big mistake, okay?  I was on a lot of painkillers at the time and I thought it was what I wanted.
"
Stan,"Dude, wanna do some math problems?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"And then, I go to the doctor, right? And I say ""Doctor, I wanna go back to being a man,"" and he says ""There's been too much damage. You can't go back. Where are you going to find a penis?""  Whattaya mean, where am I gonna find a penis?!  I'm a man! I deserve a God damned penis! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Mr. Gar- Mr. Garrison!  Could we speak with you please?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What do you want? I'm trying to teach.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay? 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Ohhh it's so easy for you, Mackey! You have a penis! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Ooookay students, um, obviously we've had a little emergency with your teacher, so uh, while we deal with this, we need one of you to lead the class and review for tomorrow's quiz.
"
Cartman,"Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
"
Principal Victoria,"Uhh, who, who else would like to be teacher for the day? Anybody else? 
"
Cartman,"Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
"
Principal Victoria,"Any other volunteers, perhaps?
"
Cartman,"Rrrrrrr! Principal Victoria. Principal.
"
Principal Victoria,"All right, all right, fine. Eric, you lead the class.
"
Cartman,"Yes! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Now, just lead a review over whatever Mr. Garrison's been teaching you, and I'll be back to check on you shortly.  Well well well. Who's teacher now?  Yeahhh. Who's teacher?!
"
Kyle,"You're not the teacher, fatass.
"
Cartman,"That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 
"
News Anchor,"And so it appears that the local farmer's market could be soon facing complete closure. In other news tonight, a South Park bio company is coming under fire for genetically engineering body parts onto laboratory mice. This picture of a mouse  genetically altered to grow a human ear has already sparked waves of protest.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What?
"
News Anchor,"But the scientists say the process could help thousands of people who've become disfigured and need ears or noses.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Holy Freaking Jesus.
"
Researcher 1,"Using common genetics and cartilage scaffolding, we can graft almost any body part onto a mouse and allow it to develop. Here's the mouse you saw on television.  Once the ear fully forms, it can be transplanted onto a person.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Doctor, what about a penis?
"
Researcher 1,"Well, a penis is something a man puts into a woman's vagina.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"No, no. If I gave you some of my DNA, could you grow a penis on a mouse for me?
"
Researcher 1,"You don't understand: doing this stuff is very expensive. And we've never tried a penis before; there's no guarantee it would work.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"I will give you all the money I have to just try. Please. Doctor, I'm a man trapped in a woman's body. I need a penis.
"
Researcher 1,"All right.  All right, let's see what we can do.
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric, we've called you in to commend you for your role as student teacher.
"
Cartman,"Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, ""commend"" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?
"
Principal Victoria,"After leading your class through review, your schoolmates scored higher than they ever had on their tests. Whatever you did really worked on them.
"
Cartman,"Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
"
Principal Victoria,"These gentlemen from the Denver County School Board have something they want to ask you.
"
Board Rep 1,"Young man, word of your success as a student teacher has started the whole board thinking. We would like you to try your methods on one of our inner-city school classes.
"
Board Rep 2,"These kids just won't listen to any adult teachers and, since you handled your class so well, how would you like to give it a shot?
"
Cartman,"That sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most. How much will you pay me?
"
Cartman,"Three hundred bucks! Did you hear what I said, you guys?! My awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three. Hundred. Bucks.
"
Kyle,"You're not an awesome teacher!
"
Cartman,"Whatever. The whole class scored super-high on the test.
"
Kyle,"The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
"
Cartman,"Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
"
Kyle,"Kenny's!
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, that was my idea.)
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah. But whatever, I'm gonna go teach those underprivileged inner-city students and really turns their lives around.
"
Kyle,"Do you know what those kids are going to do to you?! A little middle-class white boy telling them what to do? They are going to fucking murder you! 
"
Cartman,"Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
"
Principal,"Students, quiet! Quiet please!  Give me your attention!
"
Teen Boy 1,"I'll give you my attention. All night long, Mrs. Miller. 
"
Mrs. Miller,"You're on thin ice, Rodriguez! Now listen up! The Denver County School Board has sent over a special guest teacher.
"
Class,"Ohhhhhhhhhhh.
"
Mrs. Miller,"This may be your last shot at graduating from high school at all! I want you to welcome... Eric Cartmanez
"
Cartman,"Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
"
Teen Boy 2,"What the hell is thiiis?
"
Cartman,"I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
"
Researcher 1,"Iii think you're going to be very pleased with the progress, Ms. Garrison.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Mr. Garrison! 
"
Researcher 1,"Sorry, Mister Garrison. Your DNA has replicated and grafted very successfully with the mouse. And so... here's your penis. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Wow! My penis looks great!
"
Researcher 1,"Yes. It's a fantastic penis. Congratulations.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"How long before it's ready?
"
Researcher 1,"Welll, it still has some forming to do, but fairly soon.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Let me see if it feels right in my hand. 
"
Researcher 1,"No! Don't open the- 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Whoa no!
"
Researcher 2,"Don't let it get out of the lab! 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Mah penis!  Stop, penis! Come back here!
"
Cartman,"Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
"
Teen Boy 3,"Hey man, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
"
Teen Boy 4,"Yeahhhh.
"
Cartman,"Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
"
Teen Boy 5,"Getting into college? Maaan, we ain't gettin' in no college! Fuck you! 
"
Cartman,"How do I reach these keeds?  The reason that you think you can't get into college is because you haven't been taught... how to cheat properly! How do you think white people always get ahead? Because we cheat all the time- I mean because they cheat all the time.  This is Bill Beelichick, coach of the New England Patriots He's won three Super Bowls. How? He cheated. He even got caught cheating, and nobody cared. Bill Beelichick proved that in America it's okay to cheat. As long as you cheat your way to the top.
"
Teen Girl 1,"Hey, I don't wanna be called a cheater!
"
Cartman,"No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
"
Teen Boy 6,"This is bullshit. I don't wanna waste my time learning to cheat.
"
Cartman,"Go ahead, the door's right there.  Bye-bye, have fun, we will miss youuu.  How do I reach these keeds?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Boys! Boys, have you seen my penis? 
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"My penis is on the loose! If you see it, just try to catch it with some cheese. 
"
Butters,"Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.
"
Cartman,"Nice form, compadre. 
"
Teen Boy 6,"Hey, I walked out of your class, teacher. Look, I don't wanna argue with you about the merits of cheating.
"
Cartman,"Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
"
Teen Boy 7,"Sure thing, Mr. C.
"
Cartman,"Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 
"
Teen Boy 6,"AAAAH! 
"
Cartman,"Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
"
Teen Boy 6,"You cheated!
"
Cartman,"What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
"
Teen Boy 6,"Fuck you, man, you can't do that!
"
Cartman,"Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 
"
Teen Boy 6,"I know what you're trying to say, but I still don't agree with it. 
"
Cartman,"Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?
"
Linda,"What is that?  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Eeeek! Eeeek!  Stephen! Stephen come quick!
"
Stephen,"What is it, dear?
"
Linda,"A penis is loose in our kitchen!
"
Stephen,"A penis?
"
Linda,"Yes! It just ran across the floor!
"
Stephen,"Now darling, calm down.
"
Linda,"Calm down nothing! I don't want that penis running through my house!
"
Stephen,"Hoh, women. Always afraid of penises. 
"
Linda,"There! There, you see it?
"
Stephen,"Oh, it's just a little penis, darling.
"
Linda,"I don't care. It's probably got all kinds of diseases. 
"
Butters,"Hey wait! I think that's teacher's penis!
"
Stephen,"Your teacher's penis?
"
Butters,"Yeah, that must be his.
"
Stephen,"Butters, how do you know what your teacher's penis looks like?
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Cartman,"Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
"
Teen Boy 6,"I thought that... well maybe I can give cheating a try.
"
Cartman,"Have a seat, amigo. Good to have you baaack.  All right. Now, when Bill Beelichick got caught with his camera, he did not panic. He simply said what every good white cheater says when caught: ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" It's what you must also say when caught cheating! ""I mis-interpreted the rules."" Say it with me.
"
Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules.""
"
Cartman,"Good. Again.
"
Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules.""
"
Cartman,"Again!
"
Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules.""
"
Cartman,"Now you sound like white people!
"
Class,"""I mis-interpreted the rules!""
"
Mrs. Garrison,"What the hell do you mean you just put my penis outside?! Why didn't you call me?!
"
Stephen,"Look Garrison, my wife didn't want a penis in the house. I had to get it out.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Well now how am I supposed to find it?! It could be anywhere!
"
A Woman,"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK! 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Holy Crap! 
"
Woman,"Eeeek! Eeeeeek!
"
Husband,"Carole, get down from there!
"
Woman,"Noo! Didn't you see that penis just now?! Eeeek!
"
Husband,"I'm sure that penis is way more scared of you than you are of it.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"You saw a penis?!
"
Woman 2,"Eeeeeeeek! 
"
Woman 2,"Oh, it's so big and disguuusting. Eeek. 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Come back here, penis!  There you are! Got you!  Hey, you're not my penis.  Ogh!  There it goes! Stop you!
"
Cartman,"The answer to #27 is 5.
"
Class,"The answer to #27 is 5.
"
Cartman,"The answer to #28 is 14.
"
Class,"""The answer to #28 is 14.""
"
Teen Girl 2,"Man, what's the point?  What's the point of any of this? 
"
Cartman,"All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
"
Melita,"There isn't any point to all this. I won't be going to college. I'm pregnant, all right? I just found out, and Eduardo isn't going to help me raise it.
"
Cartman,"How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
"
Melita,"No. I'm Catholic. I think abortion is wrong.
"
Cartman,"Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
"
Melita,"That cheating is good?
"
Cartman,"Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
"
Melita,"I don't know, Mr. C.
"
Cartman,"Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
"
Sgt. Yates,"And the last time you saw your penis was two days ago? 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"That's right.
"
Officer Harris,"Long whiskers or short?
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Short, and little fluffy ears.
"
Officer Harris,"Fluffy ears, okay.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Think you got it, Mitch?
"
Mitch Harris,"I think so, sir. Is this pretty close? 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"No, no, not like that! That's just silly. 
"
Officer,"Sir, we might wanna get a unit down to the Italian restaurant on Kentner.
"
Sgt. Yates,"What is it?
"
Officer,"Call just came through. Seems a penis broke in and tried to eat their cheese.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Wall come on! 
"
Woman 2,"EEK!
"
Man 2,"What's the matter?
"
Woman 2,"A penis!
"
Woman 3,"A penis? Where?
"
Woman 4,"There it is!  Eek! 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Where is it?!
"
Mitch Harris,"Look, there! 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Come on! 
"
Chef,"What'sa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen? 
"
Mrs. Garrison,"Huy! Don't you dare kill my penis!  Crap! We've gotta go back around!
"
Mouse,"Someone somewhere is loving me tonightLooking at the same moon and seeing it so bright.
"
Penis,"Someone somewhere is feelin' my despair
"
Mouse,"Feelin' my despair
"
Penis,"And this same moon is
"
"Penis, Mouse","making them think of that-.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"There it is!  No! Nooo!  No! No!
"
Mitch Harris,"There's not a chance now.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"No we, we can find it! 
"
Sgt. Yates,"Sorry Garrison, your penis is gone. Afraid there's nothing more we can do. You'll just have to live with being a woman. A very ugly one. Come on, men. 
"
Mrs. Miller,"Students, I want to congratulate you on your amazing test scores. The school board is so impressed with your progress that they are going to let you take the standardized advanced placement test for college credit.  The test is going to be heavily monitored in a private room at their location to assure that there can be absolutely no cheating.
"
Cartman,"Uh what?
"
Mrs. Miller,"The test will be tomorrow. Make us proud. 
"
Teen Boy 8,"Monitor us in a private room?
"
Teen Boy 3,"Now they're gonna know we've been cheating all along.
"
Teen Boy 2,"I knew it man! You made us believe in your way and now it's all for nawthing!
"
Cartman,"Ih it's not for nothing. Ih, if you're good enough, you can cheat right in front of them.
"
Teen Boy 8,"Shut up, man! You reyally screwed us all!
"
Cartman,"How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
"
Teen Girl 1,"Yeah, come on, we can do this, guys.
"
Cartman,"You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
"
Mrs. Garrison,"You did this to yourself, Garrison. Get your hopes up with a stupid genetic experiment and now all your money's gone along with your penis.  Well what the?  Why... it's my penis.  My penis came back. But why?  I guess it's true. What's that old saying? ""If you love your penis, let it go...""
"
Mrs. Miller,"The standardized advanced placement test is considered one of the most difficult and carefully monitored tests in the country. Twenty-four of our students took the test and all twenty-four scored 100% 
"
Teen Boy 6,"Uh, can we say something?
"
Mrs. Miller,"Sure. 
"
Teen Boy 6,"We would like to present this plaque to the person who taught us the White People Method. Mr. Cartmanez! 
"
Cartman,"I reeached these keeeds.
"
Principal Victoria,"Students and faculty, please put your hands together and help me in welcoming back, Mister Garrison. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.
"
A Teacher,"Whoa uh wait, uh, hang on a second. My wife had ovarian cancer, so she can't have babies.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!
"
Sharon,"Get off the Internet, Stanley, it's time for bed.
"
Stan,"Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
"
Sharon,"Now, Stanley. The Internet will be waiting for you in the morning. Off!
"
Stan,"Aw man! 
"
Sharon,"Shelly, off the Internet. It's bedtime.
"
Shelly,"Mom, I'm i-chatting with my boyfriend in Montana!
"
Sharon,"Now, Shelly! 
"
Shelly,"Why do you hate me?!
"
Sharon,"Randy, off the Internet.
"
Randy,"Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.
"
Sharon,"No, mister, it's time for night-night.
"
Randy,"But Sharon, I've got stuff to do. I've gotta see my credit rating, I've gotta send an e-mail to Nelson and check out Foley's vacation photos-
"
Sharon,"You don't have to do all that now! You can do one more thing and then it's bedtime. 
"
Randy,"One more thing?  Ooooyeah... 
"
Stan,"What the hell?
"
Randy,"Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! 
"
Stan,"What?
"
Randy,"My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
"
Stan,"My Internet's not working either.
"
Randy,"What?! 
"
Shelly,"Dad, the Internet's not working!
"
Randy,"I know that, okay?!
"
Shelly,"I have to get online with my darling Amir before school starts!
"
Sharon,"Randy, I can't get my e-mail to open.
"
Randy,"Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 
"
Randy,"Gerald. Please help us.
"
Gerald,"Randy. What happened?
"
Randy,"Our house... It has no Internet.
"
Sheila,"Oh my God.
"
Randy,"We've got nothing! It's just gone.
"
Gerald,"Come in. You can use our Internet until you figure out what to do.
"
Randy,"Thank you Gerald. 
"
Stan,"I'm getting on it first.
"
Randy,"Oh no you're not!
"
Stan,"Kyle, I need to use your Internet
"
Kyle,"Ih it's not working.
"
Randy,"What?!
"
Kyle,"I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
"
Gerald,"No.  No, our Internet can't be broken. Ah, I've gotta get an attachment Larry sent me last night.
"
Randy,"It's not working, Gerald.
"
Gerald,"But it has to work! Maybe if I do a little-
"
Randy,"Your Internet's not working, Gerald! Face it!
"
Kyle,"I have to get online before school.
"
Stan,"What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
"
Randy,"Right, Starbucks!
"
Gerald,"Everyone get your stuff; we can take my car.
"
Stephen,"Hey, is your- is your guys' Internet working?
"
Randy,"No! Nobody's is!
"
Man 1,"Whaaaaat's haaappeniiiiing?!
"
Randy,"Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
"
Gerald,"Everyone in the car. We have to beat them there. 
"
Randy,"God, the whole neighborhood's affected. 
"
Gerald,"Get out of the way, Peterson! 
"
Clerk,"Folks, there's, there's no Internet here. It's not working, I tell ya.
"
Kyle,"It's not working here?
"
Randy,"Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
"
Man 2,"No, don't. You're wasting your time.
"
Randy,"How do you know?!
"
Man 2,"Because we just came from there! There was nothing! Not one scrap of Internet!
"
Gerald,"How can there be no Internet anywhere? What's going on?!
"
Stephen,"Anybody got a Blackberry? Check Drudge Report.
"
Randy,"Good idea!  No wait, we can't check Drudge Report: there's no Internet!
"
Mr. Garrison,"There has to be a way to find out what's going on.
"
Gerald,"We can't! Don't you get it?! There's no Internet to find out why there's no Internet!
"
Man 3,"What did we used to do to get the news before the Internet?
"
Randy,"A television! 
"
Anchorman,"Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news. It appears that we have no Internet here at News 4. We'll be happy to bring you up on current events just as soon as our Internet is back.
"
Randy,"Jesus, it's statewide.
"
Gerald,"It could be nationwide.
"
Anchorman,"Hello? Do you have Internet? It it's Channel 4 News. No, we don't have Internet either. 
"
Gerald,"No Internet... anywhere...
"
Randy,"Jesus... we're all alone... 
"
Sharon,"What's the matter?
"
Randy,"I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 
"
Shelly,"What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don't get online with him. Maybe he thinks I'm dead.  If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I'm gonna kill him! And you! 
"
Randy,"Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!
"
Stan,"Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
"
Randy,"You're right. We can't just sit here any longer.
"
Gerald,"Randy, where will you go?
"
Randy,"We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
"
Gerald,"You don't know if there's any Internet in California.
"
Randy,"Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
"
Stephen,"It could come back.
"
Randy,"Yeah, and maybe it won't! In the meantime I got a family who needs the Internet right away. We'll head out Californee Way and ... see what we can find.  Come on, let's go.
"
Stephen,"Look, if you... if you do find the Internet, let us know, will ya?
"
Randy,"How. You won't have Internet. 
"
Motel Clerk,"Sorry folks, we're full up.
"
Randy,"Know anywhere else we can stay? We're... heading out Californee Way. Looking for some Internet.
"
Motel Clerk,"You and everyone else. You'll have to stay out at the transient camp with all the others heading to Californee.  It's about a mile down the road.
"
Randy,"I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 
"
Transient Man 1,"Where are you from, old-timer?
"
Old-Timer,"Kansas City. Had me a store there. Kind of... computer supply store. When the Internet went, the stores went too.
"
Transient Man 2,"Things will be different when we get out to Californee. Soon as we get us some Internet we can all rest easy.
"
Transient Man 3,"Why sure, Silicon Valley. They gots a whole mess of Internet up there. 'Say a man can practically roll around in it.
"
Transient Man 4,"When I get to that Internet I'm gonna click on just about everything in sight. 'Might even click on a pop-up ad just for the heck of it.
"
Transient Man 1,"Well I'm gonna sit down at that Internet and just stahrt e-mailin'. Just keep on e-mailin' till my fingers are sore to the bone.
"
Randy,"Sure will be nice. 
"
Transient Man 5,"You folks all headin' to Silicon Valley?
"
Randy,"That's right. We need to get online.
"
Transient Man 5,"Haha. ""Get online"" he says.
"
Stan,"What's so funny about that?
"
Transient Man 5,"Think about it. How many folk headin' out to Californee? A million? More? And how much Internet you think they got out there?  Might be some Internet, sure, but with everyone tryin' to use it at once, it's gonna go real slow-like. I knows it 'cause I seen it. My two children, they tried to load a Web page. Took them over three days. They sat there waitin', and by the time the loadin' bar was only half-full they was dead.  Starve on the Internet, with a belly stuck out like a big bladder... 
"
Randy,"Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. 
"
Shelly,"Amiiir... I miss you so much...
"
Stan,"Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
"
Randy,"Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 
"
Worker,"Name?
"
Randy,"Do they have Internet here?
"
Worker,"Name?
"
Randy,"Marsh.
"
Worker,"Service provider?
"
Randy,"NetZero.
"
Worker,"All right, stay in line.  Once you're inside, Red Cross volunteers will direct you to your campsite.
"
Randy,"So is there Internet here?
"
Worker 2,"Stay in line and get to your campsite. 
"
Randy,"Excuse me, we're looking for some Internet.
"
Refugee Man 1,"Yeah, they've got it here. 
"
Stan,"All right!
"
Refugee Man 2,"But there ain't enough to go around. All they got is a little Internet.  Barely a bar a signal. So they have to ration it out, carefully.
"
Refugee Man 3,"Ya... sign up over there and use your time when they call your name. Each family gets 40 seconds o' Internet per day.
"
Randy,"Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
"
Volunteer 1,"Well it's all we got, so we gotta make do.
"
Refugee Man 4,"Look, honey, we ordered us some books on Amazon.
"
Volunteer 2,"All right, time's up.
"
Refugee Man 4,"No! No wait! I haven't entered the shipping information!  NO! NOO!
"
Volunteer 2,"Next? Brady, John H.
"
Randy,"Awww, how am I supposed to see Internet porn that way? 
"
Sharon,"What did you say?
"
Randy,"Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
"
Anchorman,"And that's about all we know. Uhh, there might be some Internet still in California and parts of Florida, though we certainly still don't have any here. 
"
Anchorman 2,"A fax! A fax is coming through! 
"
Anchorman,"Oh yeah, a fax!!
"
Anchorman 2,"Oh a fax!
"
Anchorman,"It's a fax, it's a fax! It's a fax, it's a fax!
"
Anchorman 2,"It's a fax, we got a fax!  Uh-
"
Anchorman,"Oh! it says, ""The government has sent their best people to the Internet in order to repair it.""
"
Anchorman 2,"We've gotta send a reporter out to the Internet!
"
Kyle,"Where... is... the Internet?
"
General,"Gentlemen, the President is very angry that his Internet still isn't working.
"
Scientist 1,"We've tried everything, sir, but the Internet has slowed to a trickle and we can't get it working correctly.
"
General,"Take me down below! I want to see the Internet for myself!
"
Scientist 2,"Here it is, general. The Internet. 
"
General,"What's wrong with it?
"
Scientist 2,"See that flashing orange light in the middle? It's supposed to be solid green.
"
General,"My God.
"
Transient Man 6,"Hahaha, thedancingkitty.com, heh, wum, I wonder what that is, hum?  ""Click on the dancing kitty and you could win a prize!"" hoh, ahaha, ha.
"
Volunteer 2,"All right, time's up.
"
Refugee Man 5,"No, wait, I I just clicked on the kitty. I got it.  No! It wasn't long enough! NOO!
"
Volunteer 2,"Next? Nelson, Peter T.
"
Randy,"Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
"
Volunteer 3,"Look, we're just tryin' to get by here. Everyone's gotta take what they can get.
"
Randy,"I haven't jacked off in over two weeks.
"
Volunteer 3,"So jack off.
"
Randy,"You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
"
Volunteer 3,"What do you want us to do? Pick up the whole computer and put it inside for ten minutes just for you?!
"
Randy,"Three minutes would be plenty.
"
Volunteer 3,"Get lost! 
"
Randy,"Ohhh.
"
Sharon,"All right, each of you take a ticket. When they call your name you can use the Internet.
"
Shelly,"What number are you, turd?
"
Stan,"Eight fifty one.
"
Shelly,"You're nine twenty three now.
"
Stan,"Hey! Mom!
"
Sharon,"Shelly, give your brother his ticket back!
"
Shelly,"Can't you all see I'm in pain?! Nobody understands pure love! Amir and I are closer than anybody in this stupid family! 
"
Refugee Man 5,"Psst. Hey! Over here!  You... happen to be looking for Internet porn?
"
Randy,"Yeah, how'd you know?
"
Refugee Man 5,"Lots of us fellas came here for that reason. We all got used to seein' lots of really perverted stuff on the Internet, so now we can't go back to Playboy.
"
Randy,"I know, right?
"
Refugee Man 5,"Anyway, we got us a simulator. You just call out what you wanna see and then say ""click"".
"
Randy,"""Internet Porn Simulator"" 
"
Refugee Man 5,"Give it a try. 
"
Randy,"Uh, Japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids? Click.  Oh this sucks! I can't jack off to this!  Damn it.  Uhm, let's see. Interracial gangbang. Click.  Agh. Les-shemales! Let's try shemales. Click.  Bestiality? Click, click on that.  Ah, ah! Brazilian fart fetish porn?! Click! Click!  Dahya.  No. No, this isn't gonna work.  It's just not the same.
"
Refugee Man 5,"Well, sorry. And that'll be $49 on your credit card.
"
Randy,"Well at least that part's like the Internet.
"
Anchorman,"We, we now have a reporter on the scene. Uhl-let's go live!
"
Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm at the Internet, where government officials are doing their best to get it running again.
"
General,"All right, Internet. What do you want from us?   If we've angered you somehow, let us know.  Try to communicate with it digitally again.  I've had it with this thing! Fire a warning shot at it! 
"
Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
"
Gerald,"What is it, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"I think... I know what's wrong.
"
Shelly,"This is taking too long! When do I get to use the Internet?!
"
Stan,"It's gotta be our turn soon.
"
Volunteer 2,"All right, folks, it's bed time. No more Internet for today.
"
Refugees,"AWWW!!! 
"
Woman,"A little closer!
"
Volunteer 2,"No, no, we're locking it away until tomorrow.  Everyone get to bed!
"
Refugees,"Aw man! 
"
Woman,"Wha?!
"
Shelly,"Gggggyyaaah! 
"
Randy,"Uhuh... Finally! I'm online again! Yeeheeyes!  Japanese girls puking each other's mouths. 
"
Girl 1,"Haro Kiti kawaii n desho? 
"
Girl 2,"Un. Choukawaii yo ne! 
"
Randy,"Oh niice... Whoa... 
"
Girl 1,"Watashi wa... daisuki! 
"
Randy,"Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 
"
Refugee Man 2,"What is that?
"
Refugee Man 4,"Sounds like someone's bein' attacked by a tiger.
"
Randy,"Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
"
Volunteer 4,"Get the keys! We gotta get in there. 
"
Randy,"Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! 
"
Volunteer 2,"What the...? 
"
Stan,"Dad?
"
Sharon,"Randy!
"
Randy,"Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
"
Volunteer 2,"You son of a bitch!
"
Randy,"Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 
"
Field Reporter,"This is our last chance. With nowhere else to turn, the government is going to allow one brave nine-year-old boy  to attempt his method to get the Internet running again.  It all comes down to this. Can the little Jewish boy reason with the Internet? Or will it be gone forever?
"
Scientist 1,"All clear for procedure.
"
General,"All right! Let's do it! 
"
Scientist 2,"Look! The flashing yellow light is steady green now!
"
Scientist 1,"He did it!
"
Scientist 3,"I've got Internet!
"
Scientist 4,"Me too!
"
Scientist 5,"Internet activity in all sectors, sir. 
"
Transient Man 5,"I've got Internet.
"
Transient Man 6,"Me too!
"
Transient Man 3,"It's back! 
"
Anchorman,"It's back? It's back! 
"
Shelly,"It's working! I can i-chat with my darling Amir now! 
"
Amir,"Shelly. Shelly Marsh? 
"
Shelly,"What?
"
Amir,"It's me. Amir.
"
Shelly,"O... kay.
"
Amir,"Your family came here too, huh?
"
Shelly,"Yeah. 
"
Amir,"So uhhh, I guess I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back home.
"
Shelly,"Yeah, okay. Sounds good.
"
Amir,"Okay, s-see ya. 
"
Shelly,"We're back togehhhther! We're back togehhhther!
"
Randy,"And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. 
"
Pioneer Paul,"Hi, kids, and welcome to my village. I settled here in 1864 with my mahr and pahr. Sure thing, I ain't never seen strange clothes like you all are wearin'. And what's that fancy yellow horse carriage you got out there?
"
Stan,"Ughh.
"
Kyle,"This is gonna suck.
"
Pioneer Paul,"When you all are ready just head up to the village. All the townfolk are there to answer yer questions. And welcome.  To 1864. Set 'em up!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
"
Cartman,"Let's be partners, Kenny.
"
Kenny,"(No, I'm partners with Craig) 
"
Cartman,"Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 
"
Stan,"Naw, I'm with Wendy.
"
Cartman,"Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"I hate you, remember?  You wanna be partners, Jimmy?
"
Cartman,"Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Eric, partner with Butters.
"
Cartman,"God damn it!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Hold Butters' hand, Eric! 
"
Cartman,"That isn't necessary!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
"
Butters,"I understand. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"All right, let's head in. 
"
Cartman,"You can let go now, Butters.
"
Butters,"No.
"
Cartman,"Butters, come on!
"
Butters,"No! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner!
"
Smithy,"Why howdy partners.  I'm the town blacksmith. Are you folks settlers, or are you just trappers passin' through?
"
Stan,"Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
"
Wendy,"Thanks, Stan.
"
Pioneer Paul,"These folks sure are strange, Smithy. We ain't never seen them kind of fancy hats in our time, have we?
"
Kyle,"That guy is wearing a digital watch.
"
Smithy,"Oh jeez. 
"
Pioneer Paul,"Damn it Chad!
"
Chad,"S-sorry, I'm sorry.
"
Gunsmith,"Why howdy, partners, I'm the town gunsmith. You see, in our time it's pretty violent. See them holes in the walls? That's so we can put rifles through to protect us from Injuns.
"
Cartman,"I wanna shoot an Indian.
"
Gunsmith,"Now some of you might wanna meet Abigail at the candle-makin' house. Or you can head over to the general store. 
"
Butters,"Do you see any Indians?
"
Cartman,"Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  ""Super... Phun Thyme.""  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
"
Butters,"Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
"
Cartman,"Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
"
Butters,"Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
"
Cartman,"Fine, then let go of my hand!
"
Butters,"Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
"
Cartman,"Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
"
Butters,"I'm not lettin' go!
"
Cartman,"Fine, then you're comin' with me!
"
Butters,"No, Eric! 
"
Cartman,"Butters, let go God-damn it!
"
Butters,"No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!
"
Pioneer Paul,"This here is our general store. It's where I buy all my supplies an' sich.
"
Clerk,"Howdy partners. I own this hearrr general store.
"
Wendy,"Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.
"
Clerk,"What do you mean ""back then""? Don't forget, it's 1864.
"
Kyle,"Right. Except for it really isn't.
"
Pioneer Paul,"Wuh, sure it is. Just look around ye. 
"
Kyle,"What's that?
"
Stan,"Sounds like police sirens.
"
Pioneer Paul,"What's a si-rene? We ain't never heard of no sirene in 1864. 
"
Leader,"We lost them, we lost them!
"
Injured Man,"Damn pig cops!
"
Leader,"Close that gate! 
"
Wendy,"What's going on?
"
Stan,"I don't know. 
"
Leader,"Everyone down on the ground NOW!
"
Sheriff,"Wuh-whoa now, I'm Sheriff McLawdog. I settled here back in eighteen fif- 
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
"
Pioneer Paul,"A phone? Why, what's a phone? We ain't never hearda sich a thing.
"
Stan,"What?!
"
Kyle,"Come on, this is serious!
"
Pioneer Paul,"Eh storehand, you ever heard of this fancy shmancy phone?
"
Clerk,"Uhhh, nooo. W-we ain't got a phone in our time.
"
Stan,"Dude, they just shot a guy in the face! We've gotta call the cops!
"
Pioneer Paul,"If you mean the law, only law around here is town sheriff McLawdog. You see, 1864 is a time of growth and development in the Old West.
"
Stan,"This is not the time for that!
"
Cartman,"Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
"
Butters,"Well, that's your problem!
"
Cartman,"All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
"
Butters,"Make that two! 
"
Cashier,"Aww, aren't you two cute holdin' hands. Are you special little buddies?
"
"Butters, Cartman","NO! 
"
Cartman,"Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
"
Butters,"We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
"
Cartman,"Butters, we're going to get back before anybody even notices we're gone. Let's go hit the bumper cars! 
"
Wendy,"Over here. This looks like an office.
"
Kyle,"Here! Here's the phone! 
"
Pioneer Paul,"Well, what a straaange contraption.
"
Wendy,"I can't get a dial tone. 
"
Kyle,"What's the number to dial out?
"
Pioneer Paul,"Dial out? Partner, them are some funny words you're usin'.
"
Stan,"Dude, do you understand what's going on here?! 
"
Clerk,"Maybe they're right, Brian. I mean, this is a special circumstance that-
"
Pioneer Paul,"Brresh! 
"
Clerk,"Ogh, I mean, this here room is, it sure is strange. We have nothin' like these fancy devices in our time.
"
Pioneer Paul,"I'll say.
"
Kyle,"I got through. Hello, police?
"
Operator,"Nine one one, what's your emergency?
"
Kyle,"There's some terrorists or bankrobbers or something that have taken our class hostage!
"
Operator,"Taken hostage where?
"
Kyle,"The old Pioneer Village off of Kipling.
"
Operator,"You mean that annoying place where employees won't break character?
"
Kyle,"Sister, you don't know the half of it.
"
Cartman,"Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
"
Cartman,"Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 
"
Butters,"What are you whoofelin' at? 
"
Cartman,"Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!
"
Butters,"Whoa! 
"
Cartman,"Yeheah, we're wired up!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 
"
Butters,"Th-that's it, Eric. We have to be gettin' back!
"
Cartman,"Aw, just a few more things.
"
Butters,"No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
"
Cartman,"Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
"
Leader,"Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area.  Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us. That is unfortunate for you, because when I think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. 
"
Blond,"How did they find us?!
"
Leader,"Get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building. 
"
Police Chief,"All right, men, listen up! Looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here. They've got the employees and some school kids held hostage.
"
Lieutenant,"Tucker, Dylan, set up a perimeter!
"
Police Chief,"Everyone stay on your toes! These are professionals we're dealing with here!
"
Officer,"What did they rob, sir?
"
Police Chief,"A Burger King.
"
Leader,"All right, good. Is that all of it? 
"
Balding Man,"No. Don't forget we've got these too.
"
Leader,"Excellent. Now listen, everyone, we're going to be all right. This is only a small hitch in our plan.  I'd like to speak with the chief of police!  Who is this? This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn't get exactly what he wants!
"
Kyle,"Why aren't the cops coming in?
"
Wendy,"They must be negotiating.
"
Pioneer Paul,"Them there bandits sure look mighty strange. And them pistols is way bigger than whats we's gots.
"
Kyle,"Will you shut up!
"
Stan,"Wait, you have guns here?
"
Pioneer Paul,"Sure. Sheriff got lots of rifles in his office.
"
Stan,"Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
"
Pioneer Paul,"All righty. Come on, storehand.
"
Clerk,"Yeppir! 
"
Cartman,"Uhaw man, I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's face when we tell him we had super fun time, while he was at the dumb Pioneer Village.
"
Butters,"We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
"
Cartman,"Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
"
Butters,"Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
"
Cartman,"Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
"
Butters,"What?! They called the cops?!
"
Cartman,"They must have realized we left. Damn.
"
Butters,"Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
"
Cartman,"Shhh! Butters!
"
Butters,"We're gonna get it now!
"
Cartman,"Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
"
Butters,"You just got me busted forever!
"
Cartman,"Butters, l-listen to me, listen.
"
Butters,"No! 
"
Cartman,"All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
"
Butters,"You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
"
Cartman,"If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
"
Butters,"No.
"
Cartman,"Butters?
"
Butters,"Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
"
Cartman,"All right, come on! 
"
Leader,"Keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts. Everyone check in at two-minute intervals. I hope you have good news, Ohrlich.
"
Ohrlich,"The police have us completely surrounded on all sides. There's no way we're gettin' out above ground without being spotted.
"
Leader,"Above ground?
"
Ohrlich,"Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It's an old mine shaft,  but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me'al door with a coded lock.
"
Leader,"So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police. Excellent.
"
Ohrlich,"One more thing, Frans: I want my share of the take now.
"
Frans,"What's the matter, Ohrlich? Lose your sense of trust?
"
Ohrlich,"I was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel. Then you take the loot to Berlin and I never see you again. I want my cut.
"
Frans,"Very well. 
"
Frans,"I'm going to ask you again, what is the door code to the tunnel?!
"
Smithy,"I told you, mister, what would I know about a door code? I'm just a simple blacksmith. With my trusty forge I makes all the metalworks for the village.  OW.
"
Frans,"You are an employee here, that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons,  Mister David Palmer of Colorado Springs!
"
Smithy,"Huh my name ain't Palmer, it's... Old Smithy. Hand we ain't never heard of no fire code, why, we gots to put fires out ourselves when the-  OW.
"
Frans,"That's it!  Tell me the code or you die!  One... two...
"
Smithy,"I...
"
Frans,"Yes?
"
Smithy,"I don't know nothin' about no fancy door code. I'm just a simple blacksmith. 
"
Craig,"These Pioneer Village workers are really committed to their jobs. 
"
Worker,"No. Please. Don't hurt me.
"
Frans,"Give us the code to that door and we can leave!
"
Worker,"I've never heard of sss-something called a door code.  Please, can't you ask some other way?
"
Frans,"I don't have time for your stupid game! Tell me, or you die right now! 
"
Worker,"All right, all right! Look, it's just, it's just one of those... Jenkins home security locks. You press the top button and then, and then enter 5-2 
"
Pioneer Paul,"What he meant to say, kids, is that we ain't never heard o'no fancy door code 'cause in our time, we gots to rely on wood locks and sich.
"
Frans,"God damn it you people are fucking insane!
"
Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
Frans,"Domino,  Walsky! Find out if there are any employees or students wandering about! Bring them here or shoot them! 
"
Wendy,"Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! 
"
Jimmy,"Yeah.  We've gotta geh- ...geh... get the hell ...outta here f- f-hast fast. 
"
Officer,"Sector Bravo, no activity.
"
Butters,"Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
"
Cartman,"Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
"
Butters,"That looks dangerous.
"
Cartman,"Not getting busted always is, Butters. Come on.  Good, that's good.  That's good, Good, all right then. Let's head across.  Go easy. Good.
"
Butters,"Oh gosh in heaven.
"
Cartman,"It's all right. You've got it, no problem-  OP.
"
Butters,"Whoa!
"
Cartman,"Save me!
"
Butters,"I'm gonna fall! 
"
Cartman,"... Oh dude, laaame.
"
Frans,"Frohlich, check in. Have you found any other employees?
"
Domino,"We found somebody. 
"
Walsky,"We found this guy in the jail of the sheriff's office.
"
Pioneer Paul,"You let out Murderin' Murphy?
"
Murderin' Murphy,"Y'are all gettin' it for puttin' me in that thar jail!
"
Frans,"Stop it! Stop your bad historical acting right now!
"
Woman,"Tarnation. Why'd you let Murderin' Murphy go? He's a bad man.
"
Frans,"I am the fucking bad man! Do you get that?! Knock it off and give me the mine shaft access code!
"
Pioneer Paul,"You're just gonna have to kill us, mister, 'cause you ain't makin' no sense at all.
"
Frans,"I won't kill you if you don't tell me. I'll kill one of THEM! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Not me! Not me not me not me not me! 
"
Kenny,"(What? Hey, let go.)
"
Frans,"Do you want to see a child die?!
"
Kenny,"(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
"
Butters,"I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
"
Cartman,"Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
"
Butters,"Huh... 
"
Cartman,"Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
"
Butters,"Let's do it!
"
Cartman,"Ready? Go! 
"
Frans,"What about you? Will you tell us the access code or do you want to see this kid die?!
"
Woman,"I'm sorry, I'm a woman and women in our time ain't allowed to know the carryin's on of the town proper.
"
Frans,"God damn it!
"
Kyle,"Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
"
Stan,"I can't let them do it.  I've got to make the ultimate sacrifice. 
"
Kyle,"Stan?
"
Wendy,"Where are you going, Stan?
"
Stan,"Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 
"
Frans,"All right, that does it!  On the count of three this child dies! One! Two!
"
Kenny,"(God damn it, someone help me!)
"
Stan,"Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
"
Pioneer Paul,"Ohhh, welcome, partner. 
"
Frans,"Wha-what are you doing?
"
Stan,"I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
"
Pioneer Paul,"That's right, Murderin' Murphy. He's crazy 'cause someone killed his pa.
"
Murderin' Murphy,"They killed my pahr!
"
Stan,"I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
"
Pioneer Paul,"Y-y-yeah, I understand that.
"
Clerk,"Finally, a fella that talks some sense.
"
Stan,"If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
"
Pioneer Paul,"Oh, well uh, I reckon the easiest number to remember for any big safe door lock would be... 1864.
"
Clerk,"Yup, 1864, 'cause that's the year it is.
"
Frans,"Eighteen sixty four. Ohrlich, we have the door code! Start packing up! We'll take the hostages with us! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"No, you got your door code, let us go!
"
Walsky,"Copy that. What's the code, over. 
"
Cartman,"Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
"
Butters,"Yeah, it sure has.
"
Cartman,"Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
"
Butters,"Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
"
Cartman,"Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
"
Butters,"Been a hoot all right!
"
Walsky,"Get your hands behind your head!
"
Cartman,"What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
"
Walsky,"Shut up! Put your hands behind your head! Do it now!  Let go of each other!
"
Butters,"Huh uh.
"
Walsky,"Do what I tell you!
"
Butters,"Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
"
Walsky,"Let go or else I'll put a bullet through your hands and make you let go!
"
Cartman,"Butters.
"
Walsky,"Now!
"
Butters,"No! 
"
Cartman,"Jesus Christ! 
"
Butters,"AAAAH!
"
Cartman,"AAAAH! 
"
Frans,"Go! Go take care of it! I'll stay with the hostages! 
"
Stan,"Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
"
Murderin' Murphy,"Yeah.
"
Stan,"He done killed yer pahr.
"
Murderin' Murphy,"What?! Well I'll rip his head off! 
"
Officer 2,"We've got a chance. Hostages are clear! 
"
Frans,"They are coming in! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
Officer 3,"Whoa, no, no!
"
Officer 2,"Hostages are secure at the park entrance!
"
Murderin' Murphy,"I got you now, Pioneer Paul!
"
Pioneer Paul,"They shoulda never let you out of jail, Murderin' Murphy! 
"
Police Chief,"Freeze, scumbag! It's all over! 
"
Woman,"Murderin' Murphy's gonna kill Pioneer Paul!
"
Officer 2,"Stop right now! It's over! 
"
PA System,"Howdy, partners. It's five o'clock. Pioneer Village is now closed for the day.  Head back to your wagons and have a safe trip home.
"
Pioneer Paul,"We made it!
"
Murderin' Murphy,"We made it! 
"
Woman 2,"Oh God, I can't wait to get out of this dress.
"
Murderin' Murphy,"Whoa, that was great! 
"
Pioneer Paul,"Uh, listen, if anyone still wants to know, the phone is in the administration building, you dial 9 to get out, and there's actually a back exit behind the horse troughs. Good night everybody, thanks for coming. We did it, guys!
"
Gunsmith,"Let's go to TGI Fridays and get some jalapeño poppers!
"
Murderin' Murphy,"Yeah, that'd be great!
"
Man 1,"All right!
"
Man 2,"Oh yeah, huh. Jalapeño poppers.
"
Man 3,"Let's go, huh.
"
Wendy,"Stan, you were really brave in there, but you did kind of sound like a big dork.
"
Stan,"I know.
"
Police Chief,"Come on you!
"
Frans,"You're hurting my arm!
"
Police Chief,"Too bad! You'll be going away for a long time. Was it worth it?
"
Frans,"In a way, it was. I might not have gotten away, but... at least I learned a lot about Pioneer life in the Old West. Those early settlers didn't have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today. To think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin' as simple as washing your clothes. Pioneer Village has a lot to teach us all.
"
Police Chief,"That's true. 
"
Wendy,"Hey look. 
"
Butters,"Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
"
Announcer,"Welcome to the televised broadcast of the Olympic Opening Ceremonies from Beijing.  Thousands of Chinese performers playing ancient Chinese drums.  The precision of their movements made even more impressive by their massive numbers. 
"
Cartman,"No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!
"
Liane,"Eric? Sweetie, are you having nightmares about the Chinese again?
"
Cartman,"They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!
"
Liane,"Sweetiekins, are you all right?
"
Cartman,"Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
"
Liane,"No, sweetie, the Chinese aren't going to get you.
"
Cartman,"They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
"
Cartman,"All right. Guys, we need to talk.  You know, uh we can all just pretend... that we didn't see those opening ceremonies but, the Chinese... are very real. We've gotta do something.  Are we just gonna pretend America is going to be okay? Are we just going to... wait until they've taken over the world?
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
"
Stan,"Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
"
Kyle,"Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
"
Kenny,"(Damn.)
"
Stan,"Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
"
Kyle,"Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
"
Stan,"Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
"
Kyle,"Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
"
Stan,"There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
"
Kyle,"Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
"
Stan,"How?
"
Kyle,"I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
"
Stan,"You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
"
Kyle,"I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
"
Stan,"God damn it.
"
Butters,"Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
"
Cartman,"There you are, Butters!
"
Butters,"Uhuh, Eric.
"
Cartman,"Butters, I need your help.
"
Butters,"Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.
"
Cartman,"The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
"
Butters,"The Chinese?
"
Cartman,"I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
"
Butters,"Aw, I can't stop the Chinese tonight, Eric, uh I'm supposed to make a model car with my dad.
"
Cartman,"You don't get it Butters! Our lives are about to change! The Chinese outnumber us a million to one. And when their army gets here, they're gonna kill your parents!
"
Butters,"Why are they gonna kill my parents?
"
Cartman,"Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
"
Butters,"I don't want my parents to die.
"
Cartman,"So you'll join the American Liberation Front?!
"
Butters,"Well sure.
"
Cartman,"You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
"
Butters,"Yeah,  fuck 'em.
"
Kyle,"No... No!  No...
"
Kyle,"No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
"
Stan,"Let's get out of here!
"
Kyle,"We can't just leave!
"
Stan,"Come on!
"
Kyle,"Aw it's horrible! 
"
Stan,"Oh God!
"
Kyle,"Somebody do something!
"
Clyde,"Why are they doing this?!
"
Kyle,"They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
"
Stan,"I can't watch!  Let's get out of here Kyle! 
"
Kyle,"Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
"
Stan,"COME ON LET'S GO! 
"
Kyle,"WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
"
Stan,"JUST RUN!! 
"
Clyde,"Oh God, what have they done?!
"
Stan,"Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
"
Clyde,"Whyyy? Whyyy?? 
"
Jimmy,"We can't help him now.
"
Butters,"Well I thought it was pretty good.
"
Stan,"Let's just go, Let's just go! 
"
Kyle,"NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
"
Cartman,"All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
"
Butters,"I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
"
Cartman,"This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
"
Butters,"But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
"
Cartman,"Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot.  ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong.
"
Butters,"Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
"
Greeter,"Uhh welcome to P.F. Chang's. I'll be right with you. 
"
Butters,"Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
Butters,"What?
"
Cartman,"It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
"
Greeter,"Uh, can I help you?
"
Cartman,"Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
"
Butters,"Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.
"
Greeter,"Uh yeah, why don't I seat you over here?  Your waitress will be right with you.
"
Cartman,"Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
"
Butters,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
"
Butters,"Stay calm, Eric.
"
Cartman,"They're right over there, and they're gonna start screaming and banging on those drums, and then they're go-  Thank you Butters. All right, we need to go over there and find out what we can from those Commie rats.  Oh, herro, prease, herro.
"
Butters,"Herro, prease.
"
Cartman,"So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
"
Butters,"Fing fong ting tong.
"
Cartman,"Ting ton teetong.
"
Mother,"What are they doing?
"
Father,"I don't know.
"
Cartman,"Yeah,  So, what are the plans to take over America again? I fohgot. 
"
Stan,"Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
"
Jimmy,"And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.
"
Stan,"Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
"
Jimmy,"I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same.  Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator?  It didn't make any sense, Stan.
"
Stan,"I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
"
Jimmy,"You can't run away from it forever,  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.
"
Stan,"Indiana Jones! All right! 
"
Indy,"Hey there, Stan. All set to see my new adventure?
"
Stan,"You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
"
Spielberg,"Well well hello there Indiana. 
"
Lucas,"You're looking cute. 
"
Stan,"No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 
"
Spielberg,"Oh yeah! 
"
Indy,"No! 
"
Stan,"Indy! 
"
Lucas,"Yeah! Get down! Get back down! 
"
Spielberg,"Hold him, Lucas! Come on!
"
Lucas,"Heheh! He-he ain't goin' nowhere!
"
Spielberg,"Yeah!
"
Stan,"No, stop! Raape!
"
Indy,"HOOOOOOOOO! 
"
Cartman,"All right, Butters, I think we've almost got the Chinese to trust us! Now as soon as they tell us their invasion plans, make a run for that door, okay?!
"
Butters,"Okay, okay.
"
Cartman,"Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
"
Butters,"Huh, invasion pran.
"
Cartman,"What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 
"
Father,"'Scuse me, miss?
"
Greeter,"Yes sir?
"
Father,"These people won't leave us alone.
"
Cartman,"...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
"
Father,"You aren't Chinese.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God...
"
Butters,"We're busted! Uh what do we do??
"
Greeter,"Okay, why don't we go...
"
Cartman,"Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
"
Butters,"A gun?
"
Cartman,"Hold the gun on them Butters!
"
Butters,"I don't want a gun, Eric!
"
Cartman,"They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
"
Butters,"Oh jeez...
"
Cartman,"Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
"
Patron,"This is stupid. I'm leaving!
"
Cartman,"Nobody is going anywhere until the police arrive!
"
Patron,"Screw you!
"
Cartman,"Shoot him, Butters!
"
Butters,"No!
"
Cartman,"You have to shoot him, Butters! He's gonna warn all the Chinese and they're gonna kill your parents! Do it! Do it!
"
Butters,"Waah! 
"
Patron,"Ow! A-Ah! A-Ooowww!
"
Cartman,"Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Cartman,"That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
"
Butters,"But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
"
Cartman,"It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
"
Kyle,"My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
"
DA,"You want to bring Steven Spielberg and George Lucas to trial for raping Indiana Jones.
"
Kyle,"I know that I'll have to testify, that I'll have to... relive what I saw that day.  But I can't let Spielberg and Lucas get away with it. Not this time. Even if I have to do it alone.
"
Stan,"You aren't alone. 
"
Kyle,"Stan?
"
Stan,"We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
"
Kyle,"I love you too.
"
DA,"Uh kids, kids, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.
"
Stan,"Wh-why?
"
DA,"You don't have a case here. You can't really say that Spielberg and Lucas raped Indiana Jones in the new film.
"
Kyle,"Did you see it?
"
DA,"Yes I saw it, but I-  But I just try not to think about it.
"
Stan,"Then you saw what Lucas and Spielberg did to him!
"
DA,"I don't know what I saw!  All right?! I mean, it wa-it was dark in the theater... I mean... yeah, things got a little out of hand with the plot... the third act took too long, uh-
"
Kyle,"Indy deserved more than that!
"
DA,"GET OUT! JUST GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!  No, no... 
"
Spielberg,"Well well, Indiana Jones.  You're looking nice. 
"
Indy,"Hey. Hey! 
"
Spielberg,"There you go, Lucas! Dick him!  He's gonna do it right there! All right! All right Georgie!
"
Lucas,"Grab his hands, heh. 
"
DA,"Hey leave him alone! 
"
Spielberg,"COME ON BIG GUY!
"
Indy,"NOOO! 
"
DA,"Nooo... Nohoho...  Waaait!  Wait I... want to help! 
"
Father,"Look, we don't know what you're talking about. There's no Chinese plan to take over America.
"
Cartman,"Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
"
Captain,"You with the gun, step out or we will fire upon you.
"
Cartman,"No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
Butters,"Uhwhat?
"
Cartman,"One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
"
Officer,"The President?
"
Captain,"All right men, come on. We're going in.
"
Cartman,"No! God damn it we're serious! We'll only talk to the President! Stop! Fire a warning shot, Butters! 
"
Chinese Officer,"Ow! Ah, o-ow! 
"
Cartman,"Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
"
Butters,"What? What happened? 
"
Cartman,"God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
"
Butters,"Aw, I did it again?
"
Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
"
Butters,"Well okay, I'm sorry!
"
Cartman,"...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!
"
DA,"It's all right there in front of you, Detective. Five sworn statements from these... brave boys. It's now up to you.
"
Det. Yates,"Are you nuts?! I'm not going out and arresting Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
"
Stan,"But they raped Indiana Jones!
"
Kyle,"I know it's hard to think about, but you have to be strong. Remember how that movie made you feel.
"
Det. Yates,"I didn't see it. 
"
Jimmy,"...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
"
Det. Yates,"No! I don't think anybody here saw it. Did you, Mitch?  Mitch? Mitch? 
"
Spielberg,"Well well, Indiana Jones. What you doin' in our neck of the woods?  Now let's see you just drop them pants!
"
Indy,"Drop?
"
Spielberg,"Just take 'em right off.
"
Indy,"Uh what do you guys want?
"
Lucas,"Don't say anything, just do it. And pull off that little ol' biddy. The shirt there, too. 
"
Spielberg,"Them panties. Take 'em off.  There, boy! I bet you can squeal! I bet you can squeal like a pig!  Come on, squeal. Squeal now. Squ-squeal!  Weeee! Squeal.
"
Indy,"We-eee!
"
Spielberg,"Squeal louder. Weeee!
"
Indy,"Weee!
"
Spielberg,"Louder louder! Weeee!
"
Indy,"Weee!
"
Spielberg,"Louder! Get down there boy!  Get them britches down.
"
Indy,"No...
"
Spielberg,"Yes, sir! Come on, squeal! Weeeeee!
"
Indy,"Weee!
"
Spielberg,"Weeeeee!  Weeee!
"
Indy,"Hawwww! Hawwww! 
"
Kyle,"It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
"
Cartman,"No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
"
Butters,"They uh tr-tried to come in through the roof! They were gonna take the gun.
"
Cartman,"Good! Did you kill him? 
"
Butters,"Uh, not exactly.
"
SWAT Officer,"Ow. Oh, it stings. Ohhhh. 
"
Butters,"Well it's not where I aimed, honest.
"
Cartman,"Dude...
"
Butters,"I seriously didn't mean it.
"
Cartman,"Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
"
Butters,"What? Uh where are you going, Eric?
"
Cartman,"You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
"
Butters,"By, by my, by myself?
"
Cartman,"I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
"
Captain,"Go inside! Move! 
"
Deputy 1,"George Lucas and Steven Spielberg! We have a warrant for your arrest!  Break it in! 
"
Deputy 2,"My God. 
"
Spielberg,"Heey, what, what the hell are you doin' here?!  You've got nothin' on us! Seven hundred million box office!
"
Lucas,"Hm this is bullshit!
"
Stormtrooper,"Weeee! Weeee!
"
Det. Yates,"Boys, we got 'em.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Det. Yates,"Spielberg and Lucas, they were... raping a Stormtrooper when the police broke in.
"
Mitch,"And they found the dead raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round in their closet.  They'll never be free to do this again. 
"
Stan,"So, what now?
"
Jimmy,"Do you think things can ever go back to n-n-n, n-no, normal after this?
"
Clyde,"What do we do?
"
Kyle,"We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
"
Captain,"Everyone just stay where you are until we can sort this all out.
"
Father,"There's nothing to sort out! These kids need to be put in jail!
"
Captain,"We're going to search everyone and get statements! And the-
"
Officer 1,"Sir! Sir, it's over. They got 'em.
"
Captain,"Got who?
"
Officer 1,"Spielberg and Lucas, they... finally got them for what they did to Indiana Jones, sir. 
"
Captain,"Hohhh, they got them.
"
Officer 2,"They got 'em. It's over.
"
Officer 3,"It's over. 
"
Father,"That means... they'll never be free to rape again.
"
Waiter,"It's over its over. 
"
Officer 4,"I love you.
"
Officer 5,"I love you too. 
"
Butters,"So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
"
Cartman,"I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
"
Butters,"...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats.  Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? 
"
Wendy,"Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 
"
Cartman,"She said it again. 
"
Wendy,"Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
"
Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Eric, for the love of Jesus...
"
Wendy,"This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!
"
Cartman,"Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
"
Butters,"I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
"
Wendy,"Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Eric, stop being offensive.
"
Cartman,"I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
"
Wendy,"No you aren't!
"
Cartman,"Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!
"
Cartman,"Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" 
"
Wendy,"What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
"
Cartman,"Not at all.  ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!""
"
Wendy,"You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!
"
Cartman,"Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
"
Wendy,"I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
"
Cartman,"Haha, you're gonna kick my ass?
"
Wendy,"That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
Cartman,"You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
"
Wendy,"You think you're tough?
"
Cartman,"Whassup?  Whassup?
"
Wendy,"I'll smack the shit out of you!
"
Cartman,"Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
"
Wendy,"After school! We fight after school! You got that?!
"
Cartman,"You're gonna fight me after school?
"
Wendy,"That's right!
"
Cartman,"You're a chick, dude.
"
Wendy,"As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.
"
Cartman,"Oh, it's on, bitch!
"
Wendy,"You're gonna  fucking die! 
"
Butters,"Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Bebe,"Wow.  Wendy and Cartman are gonna fight after school!
"
Girls,"Really? Wow.
"
Ike,"Wendy and Cartman are fighting after school. 
"
Kindergartners,"Yaaay!
"
Red,"Hey emo kids, Cartman and Wendy are gonna fight after school. 
"
Pete,"Did she just call us emos?
"
Butters,"Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
"
Token,"She is pissed off.
"
Cartman,"She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
"
Clyde,"Hey, check it out. She's totally staring you down.  She sure seems confident. You should probably go easy on her, dude. You don't wanna put her in the hospital or anything.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
"
Jimmy,"Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
"
Butters,"Yeah, heh.  If you got beat up by a girl, everyone would think you were a faggot. 
"
Cartman,"Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
"
Wendy,"What?!
"
Cartman,"Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
"
Wendy,"What?
"
Cartman,"I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
"
Wendy,"If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
"
Cartman,"Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
"
Wendy,"No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
"
Cartman,"Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
"
Wendy,"Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
"
Cartman,"Oh Wendy, such a desperate attempt to get out of it. These students are a little too smart to see you're just making excuses not to fight me.
"
Wendy,"I don't want an excuse! I'm going to beat the fucking shit out of you!
"
Cartman,"Ohhh, ahhhh... That's funny. You're gonna die, you lesbo.  Wendy, seriously though, I do want to apologize. I'm really sorry and I don't think we should fight.
"
Wendy,"Get away from me! 
"
Michael,"So, everyone's saying there's gonna be a fight between Eric Cartman and your girlfriend.
"
Stan,"I guess so.
"
Pete,"And you're gonna... just let that guy... beat up on your woman? Doesn't that like, go against your jockey man code or something? 
"
Michael,"Yeah, I don't ever remember AC/DC singing about letting dudes beat up on their girlfriends.
"
Stan,"What am I supposed to do about it? 
"
Craig,"Don't worry, Stan, I don't think the fight's even gonna happen. Cartman said that Wendy's already begging him to call it off.
"
Jimmy,"I'll bet she is!
"
Butters,"Ah I hope not! I wanna see Eric kick the crap out of her! 
"
Cartman,"Wendy. Wendy psst.
"
Wendy,"What?!
"
Cartman,"Psst real, real quick. Just psst, real quick.  Wendy, you're not gonna believe this.  I just found out my mom has breast cancer.  Man, I sure got what was coming to me! I was a real jerk, and now they're gonna cut off my mom's boobs.
"
Wendy,"You really think that's gonna work on me?!
"
Cartman,"Wendy,  I have here twenty-seven dollars in cash. If you just call off the fight then I-
"
Wendy,"You can't bribe your way out of this!
"
Cartman,"Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
"
Wendy,"No you don't.
"
Cartman,"My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
"
Wendy,"You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
"
Cartman,"Eat my underwear?
"
Wendy,"That's right.
"
Cartman,"Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
"
Wendy,"Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
"
Cartman,"No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
"
Wendy,"You fucking suck so hard!!
"
Cartman,"I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
"
Wendy,"What are you doing?! 
"
Cartman,"I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 
"
Wendy,"Ew! 
"
Cartman,"Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
"
Wendy,"Oh my God!
"
Cartman,"So...  are we cool?
"
Wendy,"No!
"
Cartman,"I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-
"
Wendy,"You are so pathetic!
"
Cartman,"Wendy it isn't fair!  I ate my underwear for you! Nooo!  Yo, what's up dawg?
"
Cartman,"Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
"
Stan,"What?
"
Cartman,"You know, Wendy and I are supposed to fight in like three hours.
"
Stan,"Yeah?
"
Cartman,"Dude, aren't you worried? Wendy's a girl. She could end up getting really hurt, Stan. You're my bro, and she's your bitch. I don't wanna hurt my bro's bitch.
"
Stan,"I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
"
Cartman,"Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
"
Stan,"Really?
"
Cartman,"You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
"
Stan,"Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
"
Cartman,"God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle.  All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... 
"
Bebe,"Kick the shit out of him, Wendy!
"
Jimmy,"As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. 
"
Butters,"Almost time. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
"
Clyde,"I totally can't see the fight, dude. I have detention after school.
"
Cartman,"Detention! That's it! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
"
Cartman,"Whassup? Whassup? Crapped on your desk, dawg. What's up with that? 
"
Butters,"Huh.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. 
"
Cartman,"Ahhh, sweet.
"
Butters,"Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
"
Cartman,"What?! That's ridiculous!
"
Butters,"But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
"
Cartman,"That's not why I did it.
"
Craig,"Then why'd you crap on Garrison's desk?
"
Cartman,"Because I'm hardcore. You know, I'm I'm antiestablishment. That's how I roll, dawgs. I do hardcore stuff like that.
"
Butters,"That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!""
"
Cartman,"Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
"
Craig,"Okay, that's good, because we moved the fight to first thing in the morning tomorrow.
"
Jimmy,"Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
"
Cartman,"Huh?
"
Butters,"That way it won't matter if you get detention.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!
"
Jimmy,"Wendy said she'd be here an hour before school starts. See you in the morning, ch-ch-ch-champ! 
"
Wendy,"Tomorrow morning! You fucking die tomorrow morning! 
"
Mrs. Testaburger,"Wendy?
"
Wendy,"Yeah?
"
Mrs. Testaburger,"We need to talk to you, right now.  Wendy, have you been bullying kids at school?
"
Wendy,"What? No!
"
Mrs. Testaburger,"Well, do you want to explain why this little boy's mother had to come talk to us? 
"
Mr. Testaburger,"Did you tell this little boy you were going to beat him up?!
"
Wendy,"You don't understand. He said horrible things.
"
Cartman,"The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
"
Mrs. Testaburger,"Wendy, no matter what a person says, you don't respond with violence. Haven't we taught you that?
"
Cartman,"The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
"
Mrs. Testaburger,"Wendy, you tell this little boy you aren't going to hurt him!
"
Wendy,"Mom, you don't-
"
Mrs. Testaburger,"Now, young lady.
"
Wendy,"I'm not going to hurt you.
"
Mr. Testaburger,"If there is any word of you fighting at school it's over for you, missy! Do you understand?!
"
Wendy,"Yes sir.
"
Mr. Testaburger,"We're so sorry about this, Ms. Cartman.
"
Liane,"Oh no, thank you so much for your time. 
"
Mr. Testaburger,"It won't happen again.
"
Liane,"You're very sweet. Thank you again. Come on, muffin. 
"
Cartman,"Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
"
Butters,"Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I don't know what's going on. I mean, I showed up.
"
Bebe,"Where is she? How come Wendy's not showing up for the fight?
"
An Older Girl,"Here she comes! 
"
Cartman,"What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
"
Wendy,"You know I can't fight you!
"
Cartman,"Why not? You chicken? 
"
Wendy,"I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
"
Cartman,"Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
"
Butters,"Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
"
Cartman,"I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
"
Bebe,"Come on Wendy, kick his ass!
"
Wendy,"I can't!  God damn it!
"
Butters,"She chickened out!
"
Other students,"Aw man. 
"
Cartman,"Told you guys.
"
Stan,"Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.
"
Pete,"Yeah, I guess you've dodged a bullet, Galahad.
"
Jimmy,"I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
"
Clyde,"And so, we must all recycle. Every day. Recycling is important, and it will save our planet, Earth. The End. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay Eric. 
"
Cartman,"Thank you. My report today is on breast cancer awareness.  I do not believe enough is being done, and, like the victims of breast cancer, there's something I'd like to get off my chest.  We all must fight, and hopefully one day, titty cancer will be a distant mammary. 
"
Wendy,"You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
"
Cartman,"What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Okay Eric, that's enough you smartass!
"
Wendy,"Why?!  Why are you doing this to me?!  Why won't you just stop?!
"
Cartman,"Wendy, Wendy.
"
Principal Victoria,"Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office please? Wendy Testaburger to the principal's office.
"
Wendy,"God! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Wendy, I've been hearing rumors about a fight between you and Eric Cartman.
"
Wendy,"No ma'am, there isn't going to be a fight.
"
Principal Victoria,"Oh no? Are you sure?
"
Wendy,"Yes ma'am!
"
Principal Victoria,"I see.  I've noticed all the things you've done for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know I'm a breast cancer survivor?
"
Wendy,"Ma'am?
"
Principal Victoria,"I was diagnosed seven years ago. Cancer is... pure evil. It is a fat little lump that needs to be... destroyed.  When there is a cancer, you have to ""fight"" it. You can't reason with cancer, you can't wish it away. Cancer doesn't play by the rules, so neither can you.
"
Wendy,"My... parents said that if I fight-
"
Principal Victoria,"And you can't listen to what anybody else tells you.  You have to be willing to give up everything, because the cancer will  take everything. Do you understand?
"
Wendy,"Yes ma'am!
"
Principal Victoria,"When you have cancer you fight, because it doesn't matter if you beat it or not. You refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless!
"
Bebe,"She's gonna fight! Wendy's gonna fight Cartman right now!
"
Millie,"What? 
"
Cartman,"Go deep, Craig.  Not that deep, retard!
"
Butters,"She's coming! She's coming!
"
Cartman,"Butters, get out of here!
"
Butters,"But Wendy's coming to fight you.
"
Cartman,"...Huh? 
"
Clyde,"Oh boy here we go!
"
Butters,"All right! 
"
Pete,"It's about freaking time. 
"
Craig,"All right, let's DO IT!
"
Cartman,"What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
"
Wendy,"I don't care! 
"
Cartman,"Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
"
A Girl,"Shut up and fight! 
"
Cartman,"All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
"
Kids,"Ohhhhh!
"
Butters,"Fuck him up, Wendy!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Wendy?
"
Wendy,"I'm finished! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eh somebod - somebody call the principal! 
"
Cartman,"You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 
"
Stan,"Dude, we never thought you were cool.
"
Cartman,"That's not true. You're just saying that.
"
Kyle,"No, really. We've always thought you suck.
"
Jimmy,"Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
"
Cartman,"You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
"
Craig,"No, it's true. We've always hated you.
"
Butters,"Well yeah.
"
Cartman,"Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
"
Craig,"What?
"
Cartman,"If you're all trying to make me feel better, then you must still like me. Oh, oh phew! Oh, you had me so worried about what you guys were gonna think of me getting beat up by a girl and... it turns out you think I'm cool no matter what. Oh, oh, oh God, what a relief!  Oh, yay! 
"
Kyle,"I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
"
Kenny,"(Hey dude, I like to shave my balls.)
"
Cartman,"Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
"
Kenny,"('Cause girls like shaved balls.)
"
Kyle,"Girls like shaved balls?
"
Kenny,"(Yes they do.)
"
Cartman,"What girl is gonna see your balls?
"
Kenny,"(Well I don't know.) 
"
Stan,"Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
"
Cartman,"Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
"
Stan,"I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
"
Kyle,"I think Kenny likes it. 
"
Stan,"I gotta get home for dinner.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, me too. 
"
Stan,"God!
"
Cartman,"Shut up already!
"
Stan,"I'm outta here; see ya guys. 
"
TV,"Tonight, the Travel Channel takes you to London!  London has something for everyone! Sights!  Theater, and wonderful street performers! 
"
Stan,"They're in London too?
"
Sharon,"Hey, time for dinner guys. 
"
Sharon,"All right kids, dig in.
"
Stan,"Where's dad?
"
Sharon,"He's upstairs videotaping your grandfather in the bathtub.
"
Stan,"Why?
"
Sharon,"Because ever since your father got that stupid video camera he thinks he has to film everything the family does.
"
Randy,"All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 
"
Sharon,"Randy, we have plenty of video of us eating dinner.
"
Randy,"There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
"
Shelly,"Turn it off, Dad!
"
Randy,"Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
"
Stan,"Oh Jesus Christ! 
"
Randy,"Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 
"
Cartman,"I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
"
Stan,"You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
"
Cartman,"So?
"
Stan,"So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
"
Cartman,"How much?
"
Stan,"Over two hundred bucks.
"
Kyle,"Two hundred dollars?
"
Cartman,"Really? Are you sure?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
"
Kyle,"...Become a Peruvian flute band?
"
Stan,"Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
"
Cartman,"Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
"
Stan,"Yeah!
"
Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
Kyle,"But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
"
Cartman,"Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
"
Craig,"...Fine.
"
Cartman,"Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
"
Craig,"...Yeah.
"
Stan,"Craig, how would you like to turn that hundred dollars into a thousand dollars? 
"
Cartman,"Come on in, Craig. Have a seat. Welcome.
"
Craig,"What do you guys want?
"
Kyle,"Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
"
Cartman,"All right Craig! 
"
Craig,"You mean like those guys you see at all the tourist spots?
"
Stan,"There's a reason they're everywhere, Craig: because they make bank! We just need your money to buy instruments and make some CDs.
"
Cartman,"And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
"
Craig,"You guys never hang out with me. You never invite me to do stuff. But now you want me to be in a band with you because my grandma gave me a hundred dollars.
"
Cartman,"Craig, don't be an asshole.
"
Craig,"I'll go get the money. 
"
Stan,"All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
"
Cartman,"And a one, and a two, and a- 
"
Man 1,"Wow, that's such cultural music.
"
Man 2,"Very cultural, yes.
"
Cartman,"Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 
"
Kyle,"Gracias.
"
Woman 1,"How cultural. 
"
Kyle,"This is awesome!
"
Stan,"Ya see, Craig? 
"
Cartman,"Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! 
"
Stan,"Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
"
Cartman,"No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
"
Stan,"This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
"
Kyle,"God damn it!
"
Cartman,"No! No es bueno! 
"
Stan,"Come on, guys. 
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
Cartman,"No, no es bueno! No trabajar aqui!
"
Michael Chertoff,"Ladies and gentlemen, our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions. I'm talking of course about Peruvian flute bands.  The red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of Peruvian flute bands are. All over the world, wherever there are tourists or shoppers, there are now, on average, 65 Peruvian flute bands per square kilometer. General?
"
Chief Aide,"France, Japan, and the northeastern United States are currently the hardest hit. Make no mistake:  this is a pan flute epidemic.
"
Senator 1,"A pan-demic?
"
Michael Chertoff,"Three countries in Asia and seven in Europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their Peruvian flute bands. We will need every resource available to see this through.
"
Senator 2,"Excuse me, but... aid other countries?
"
Michael Chertoff,"Senator?
"
Senator 2,"With all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands! Let other countries fend for themselves!
"
Michael Chertoff,"You heartless bastard! This country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity! And we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by Peruvian flute bands! Is that clear?!  As director of Homeland Security, I am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained.
"
Paratrooper,"Go, go! 
"
Cartman,"Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 
"
Soldier 1,"One more over here! 
"
Soldier 2,"Let's go! Get 'em out!
"
Soldier 3,"Clear out, move! This is a Homeland Security operation, people, let's go!
"
Stan,"Hey, back off!
"
Soldier 3,"Make sure all pan flute music CDs are contained! 
"
Randy,"There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
"
Sharon,"The news.
"
Randy,"Huh?
"
Sharon,"We're watching the news.
"
Randy,"That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 
"
Anchorman Tom,"The government efforts to stop the Peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day.  In cities all over the world  flute bands have been removed and quarantined.  But more may still be out there. Homeland Security's requesting that  if you see a Peruvian flute band, do not approach it. Mark down the flute band's location, and do not, under any circumstances, buy their CDs.  The flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in Miami.
"
Stan,"Eh-excuse us. Hello?  Uh excuse me. Sir? Sir, there's been a misunderstanding. Can, can I talk to you for a minute?
"
Kyle,"Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
"
Guard,"Get back! I'm not buying any of your damned CDs!
"
Stan,"No. Sir, there's been a biiig misunderstanding. We actually aren't a Peruvian-
"
Guard,"I said I'm not buying any God damned CDs today, you got that?! I'm sick of it!
"
A Musician,"Señor? Comprar CD la musica? 
"
Kenny,"(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)
"
Craig,"""Hey, Craig. You know that money your grandma gave you for your birthday? How would you like to invest in a Peruvian flute band? You can double your money in one afternoon. Come on, Craig, don't be an asshole."" 
"
Michael Chertoff,"Attention Peruvian flute bands:
"
Translator,"Atencione bandas de flauta Perú.
"
Michael Chertoff,"We appreciate your cooperation and patience.
"
Translator,"Cooperacion y peciencia es apreciado.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Tomorrow you will be boarding ships...
"
Translator,"Mañana sera el embarque de barcos...
"
Michael Chertoff,"...which will take you to Guantanamo Bay.
"
Translator,"...que la lleva a viajar Guantanimo.
"
Michael Chertoff,"There you will spend the rest of your lives.
"
Translator,"Donde pasar el resto de sus vidas. Gracias! 
"
Kyle,"Guantanamo Bay?! We can't go to Guantanamo Bay!
"
Stan,"Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
"
Sharon,"Please, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker, our boys were last seen hanging out with your son Craig. Do you have any idea where they could've gone?
"
Mrs. Tucker,"No, I'm telling you. This isn't like Craig at all. I'm really worried.
"
Mr. Tucker,"You've checked with the police?
"
Gerald,"Nobody know anything. It's li-it's like the boys just vanished!
"
Sharon,"None of the other kids have seen them since a-  Randy, will you put that thing down?! What is wrong with you?! Our son is missing!
"
Randy,"Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
"
Sharon,"Well then stop being an idiot and help!
"
Mr. Tucker,"Maybe the boys all ran away. Were any of your boys upset about anything?
"
Gerald,"All we know is they were seen hanging out with Craig and now they're gone.
"
Sheila,"That's exactly why I told Kyle not to hang around that boy.
"
Mrs. Tucker,"What is that supposed to mean?
"
Sharon,"To be honest, Mrs. Tucker, we think Craig is bad influence on our boys.
"
Mrs. Tucker,"Now wait just a minute!
"
Sharon,"I'm just saying that your son has some problems a-
"
Mr. Tucker,"Like every kid doesn't have some problems!
"
Sheila,"Obviously Craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble.
"
Mrs. Tucker,"Oh my God!
"
Mr. Tucker,"This is ridiculous!
"
Randy,"Ohhh this is good!
"
Gerald,"That's not ridicul-
"
Soldier 4,"Sir, good news! Looks like we did it. Every major city is reporting zero Peruvian flute bands. We got 'em all! 
"
Michael Chertoff,"Calm down people, we still have work to do! We have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again!
"
Official 1,"We don't know where they came from, sir. We... we've been researching, but we... can't figure it out.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Well think about it, idiot! Where else would ""Peruvian"" flute bands come from? 
"
Official 1,"Hmm...
"
Michael Chertoff,"The country is in the name!
"
Official 2,"No. Sir, we checked the entire map. There isn't a country called Peruvian anywhere.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Not Peruvian, retards, Peru! It's right here! 
"
Official 3,"Peh-roo.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Now I want a plan in place to take out Peru once and for all!
"
Official 1,"Is that really necessary, sir? It seems a little extreme.
"
Soldier 2,"Yeah.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us  unless they are stopped at the source!
"
Chief Aide,"Sir, you'd better come quick. One of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape.
"
Michael Chertoff,"See?  God damn it! 
"
Michael Chertoff,"The Llama Brothers: Tapas and Moodscapes.
"
Stan,"This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Right. You just play pan flute music at the mall and sell CDs of you with a llama, but you're not a Peruvian flute band.
"
Stan,"We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
"
Kyle,"We just wanna go home.
"
Kenny,"(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
"
Michael Chertoff,"Which tourist location were they playing at?
"
Chief Aide,"An outdoor mall in Colorado.
"
Kyle,"Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
"
Stan,"We we speak English!
"
Cartman,"And we're White.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Let me talk to you guys out here.  Well what do you think?
"
Chief Aide,"I don't know what to make of it sir. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Clearly they are a Peruvian flute band and yet they... aren't. They play pan flute music like the others, but they talk and act like ...one of us.
"
Michael Chertoff,"I agree. They're obviously some kind of... hybrid.
"
Official 1,"A hybrid? Ah how is that possible?
"
Chief Aide,"Perhaps a Peruvian flute band mated with one of our females. Who knows?
"
Michael Chertoff,"Well however they came to be, they're about the only piece of good luck we've had. 
"
Official 1,"Sir?
"
Michael Chertoff,"If they are the hybrid we're talking about,  then they could be our way of taking out Peru once and for all.
"
Craig,"Do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you?  Because you're always doing stuff like this. You're always coming up with some stupid idea to do something, and then it backfires, and then you end up in some foreign country, or in outer space or something. That's why no one likes hanging out with you guys.
"
Cartman,"You're being extremely negative, Craig. 
"
Michael Chertoff,"All right, here's the deal: Maybe you are on our side and maybe you aren't, but if you help us... we'll get you home.
"
Stan,"Help you how?
"
Michael Chertoff,"You're able to walk amongst the Peruvian flute bands. They see you as one of them. We are going to send you to their Capital.
"
Craig,"Can we please just go home, sir?
"
Michael Chertoff,"We still don't know whose side you're on! You do this, and we'll know! You leave for Peru in the morning.
"
Kyle,"No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
"
Stan,"Kyle, calm down.
"
Kyle,"You know I can't go there, Stan!
"
Stan,"One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 
"
Michael Chertoff,"You don't have a choice! Either you go to Peru, or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands.
"
Soldier 3,"Thompson, can you come over here?  The flute band players won't shut up about something and I can't understand them.
"
Musician 2,"¡Por favor! ¡No podemos ir! ¡Estamos aquí para proteger a ustedes!
"
Musician 3,"Sí.
"
Other Musicians,"Sí. No podemos ir. Si, protectores.
"
Thompson,"They're saying something like, ""You can't send us away. We are the protectors.""
"
Soldier 3,"Protectors from what?
"
Musician 2,"¡La muerte peluda! ¡La muerte peluda!
"
Soldier 3,"What does that mean?
"
Thompson,"I think he said, ""the furry death""?
"
Musician 2,"La muerte peluda. ¡La muerte peluda!
"
Announcer,"This is CNN.
"
Anchorman Tom,"The last of the Peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world. Paul Harris is at the shopping promenade and Paul, pretty nice not having any Peruvian flute music there, I suspect.
"
Paul Harris,"Really welcome silence, Tom. There hasn't been a Peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now, and everyone is really enjoying the peace. The world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the-  What the?! 
"
Woman 2,"Oh my Gohhhd!
"
Woman 3,"Ohmigod! 
"
Paul Harris,"Jesus Christ! 
"
Shopper,"AAAAHHH!! 
"
Paul Harris,"There's, there's something else here, it's...  It's not a Peruvian flute band, it's a... Oh my God what is that thing?! 
"
Anchorman Tom,"Paul Paul, what do you see?
"
Paul Harris,"It's furry! It's very furry! 
"
Anchorman Tom,"Okay obviously something different has uh shown up a-... Did he say ""furry""?  Okay uh we're we're experiencing some uh-  My God what is that thing?!  AAAHHH!! 
"
Pilot,"All right, we're about 800 kilometers from Peru. There'll be a truck to take you inside the border where you're briefed on mission specifics. 
"
Craig,"Was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a Peruvian flute band that any of you said ""Hey, you know? This plan might backfire.""  No, that never occurred to you. Because you guys are jerks, and you never learn from your mistakes, and that's why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes.
"
Kyle,"That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
"
Craig,"I'm being a dick?
"
Stan,"Yes!
"
Craig,"You guys took my birthday money, got me arrested and sent to Miami with no way home except to take down the country of Peru, and I'm being a dick?
"
Cartman,"There's no talking to this guy.
"
Stan,"All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
"
Craig,"That would be great. Thank you.
"
Kyle,"This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
"
Kenny,"(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
"
Kyle,"Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
"
Sharon,"Please, I don't know where else to turn. The police haven't been any help, ugheh, I think our boys might really be in trouble this time. Yes. Yes. Please, check and call me right back. Thank you.  Randy I swear to God if you don't put that thing away...!
"
Randy,"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
"
Sharon,"I mean it Randy that's enough!! You don't have to videotape every single-!! 
"
Randy,"What the hell was that? 
"
Sharon,"Oh my God.
"
Randy,"Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! 
"
Shelly,"What's going on, Dad? 
"
Randy,"Get back to your room, Shelly! 
"
Randy,"What's going on?
"
Mr. Garrison,"They're all over the place!
"
Randy,"What are?!
"
Mr. Garrison,"They're really furry! 
"
Randy,"What did that?!  What is that thing?! 
"
Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Marsh, you have to move! It isn't safe to be here! 
"
Linda,"AAAAAAAAH!! 
"
Randy,"Oh my Gohhhd!
"
Stephen,"Go go go go back the other way! 
"
Randy,"Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.
"
A Woman,"Oh my Gohhhd! 
"
Randy,"HAAA! 
"
Chief Aide,"Sir? We've got a bigger problem.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Oh? And what might that be?
"
Chief Aide,"New reports are coming in from cities all over the world. Word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be... 
"
Michael Chertoff,"Guinea pigs?
"
Chief Aide,"Yes sir. How did you know?
"
Michael Chertoff,"You were so close to figuring it all out, Davis, did you know that?
"
Davis,"Sir?
"
Michael Chertoff,"I really thought you had me in Miami, but you just couldn't quite put the pieces together.
"
Davis,"You... You... knew this was going to happen.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Oh, this is only the beginning, Davis, and I can't let you interfere.  Sorry my friend, but I've worked too hard to make all this happen. The pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths, the guinea pigs are rising, and the only person who could have stopped all this... is on his way to the middle of nowhere. 
"
Shelly,"What's going on, Dad? 
"
Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Marsh you have to move! It isn't- 
"
Randy,"Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!
"
Craig,"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week was my birthday.  My Grandma gave me a check for a hundred dollars.  I was sooo happy. But then, four kids from school came to my house  and said I should use my hundred dollars to invest in becoming a Peruvian flute band.  They promised I would double my money in one afternoon.  But the government arrested us along with all the other Peruvian flute bands and took us to an internment camp in Miami.  We begged to go home, but instead the government told us they were sending us to Peru.  And so that is now why I'm in Peru. If I die, let it be known that it is because four guys I don't even like from school lied to me and took my birthday money. 
"
Stan,"We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
"
Kyle,"Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
"
Cpt. Taylor,"I don't get it. They said the military would meet us here.
"
Cpt. Gabriel,"This is where they told us to land. Can you get through to Washington?
"
Cpt. Taylor,"I'm trying. 
"
A Voice,"This is Connor in Washington.
"
Cpt. Taylor,"Hey, Connor, the place that Homeland Security told us to start the operation, there, there's nobody here to meet us. It's like they sent us to no man's land.
"
Carter,"Jesus they're everywhere!
"
Cpt. Taylor,"What are everywhere?
"
Carter,"...so furry! They're attacking... every city... ha- people dying... Ha-... guinea pigs... all over! Agh.
"
Stan,"Guinea pigs?
"
Carter,"Can't stop them! Need to get... out... ergh. I just ate... a peanut... Agh peanut now stuck... in throat... Urgh shouldn't eat peanut... when scared. 
"
Randy,"I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.
"
Sharon,"Randy, will you put down that camera? We need to figure out what to do.
"
Randy,"I don't know what to do. I'm so startled.
"
Sharon,"We have to see what the news is saying. 
"
Reporter,"This is a shot of New York City where the... giant guinea pigs have also attacked.
"
Sharon,"Guinea pigs?
"
Reporter,"Reports of attacks are coming in from major cities all over the world.
"
Randy,"Jesus, this thing is worldwide? 
"
Sharon,"Look at that thing! Randy, what are we gonna do? 
"
Randy,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
"
Sharon,"Go Randy, run! 
"
Randy,"Gotta get out!
"
Cpt. Taylor,"Michaels, Harrison, anybody?  Nothing. LSAT is down and no answer at RCU. Whatever is going on out there is huge.
"
Stan,"Ah all right, just let me get this straight: the head of Homeland Security ordered you to fly us, five kids, to Peru, but had you land way up in the Andes Mountains of Peru so that other government people could meet us and then... somehow tell us how to go to the capital of Peru, way over in Lima, and take down their government.
"
Cpt. Taylor,"...Yes, that was the order.
"
Kyle,"And that makes sense to you?
"
Cpt. Taylor,"Nope, not at all.
"
Cpt. Gabriel,"Actually, the whole rounding up of the pan flute bands didn't make sense to any of us either.
"
Stan,"None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
"
Cpt. Taylor,"You don't understand, the plan was to have a refueling truck meet us here. We don't have enough gas to fly anyplace.
"
Craig,"Oh, that's awesome.
"
Kyle,"So we've gotta find another way out of here.
"
Cpt. Taylor,"It's starting to look that way, yeah.
"
Craig,"This is fun. Let's walk for miles through a spooky jungle. It just keeps getting better and better.
"
Cartman,"You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
Cartman,"Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
"
Cpt. Gabriel,"Luck at that: no lights on, nothing. It's like, humans have never been to this part of Peru. 
"
Top Official,"More guinea pigs seem to be moving in from all directions. We checked on Wikipedia and found out that guinea pigs are from the Andes Mountains, here. 
"
Michael Chertoff,"What about the pan flute bands? Are they on their way to Guantanamo Bay?
"
Official 1,"...Sir, we believe we have bigger problems right now than pan flute bands.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Have they been loaded onto the boats or not?!
"
Official 2,"No sir. We diverted all the resources away from the pan flute bands to deal with the guinea pigs.
"
Michael Chertoff,"That was an order!  The pan flute bands were to be put on boats to Guantanamo last night!  I am still in charge here! I want those pan flute bands on the boats to Guantanamo!
"
Soldier 4,"Yes sir. I don't see why you have to yell at people. 
"
Randy,"Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!
"
Sharon,"Where do we go, Randy?
"
Randy,"We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 
"
Man,"Geow, my arm! MY ARM! 
"
Randy,"Oh Jesus!
"
Sharon,"Randy, run! 
"
Randy,"Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
"
Shelly,"Dad! 
"
Randy,"In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
"
Sharon,"Randy, put down that c-! 
"
Shelly,"It's gonna kill us!
"
Sharon,"Just stay down, Shelly. It can't come in here. 
"
Randy,"Hold on, hold on, I need to get a shot of it from outside. 
"
Sharon,"Randy? Where are you going? 
"
Randy,"Here we see a view from outside the bus.
"
Sharon,"Randy!  What the hell are you doing?
"
Randy,"I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 
"
Cpt. Gabriel,"I don't know, Lemsky. This entire area of Peru isn't even charted on the maps.
"
Cpt. Taylor,"This whole valley is strange. Just look at the size of that fruit.  Ain't that a peach? And how do you like them apples?
"
Cpt. Gabriel,"Take a look at this! They look like... beehive combs.
"
Cpt. Taylor,"Oh my God.
"
Stan,"Dude, what is this place?
"
Cpt. Taylor,"It's like... an unknown valley that time forgot, where everything grows huge.
"
Craig,"That's a shock. I decided to follow you guys, and now I'm in the land of the giants lost world.
"
Stan,"Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Stuff just happens.
"
Craig,"Stuff just happens.
"
Kyle,"That's right!
"
Craig,"You just wind up being sent by the government to take down the city of Lima only to wind up in the land of the giants lost world.
"
Cartman,"That's right.
"
Craig,"You know when stuff happens to most kids? They fall off their bikes. They get in fights with their parents. They get swindled out of their birthday money.
"
Cpt. Taylor,"Look, wherever we are, I think we'd better keep moving.
"
Kenny,"(Hey, look out!) 
"
Cpt. Taylor,"Ohhh stop it, make it stohhhp!
"
Randy,"All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
"
Butters,"Hello, heh.
"
Linda,"What is that? Chris, what is that?
"
Randy,"That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 
"
Stephen,"Oh God look!
"
Sharon,"Those aren't guinea pigs.
"
Stephen,"Get off the roof! 
"
Randy,"Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 
"
An Anchorman,"And we are now getting word of giant bees. The giant bees have been seen in the U.S. and Europe.
"
Randy,"Oh no! Oho oho. 
"
Townsman,"Get away, there's bees everywhere!  There's another one right there!  
"
Townsman 2,"It stung me! It stung me! 
"
Randy,"Whoa, that startled me! That was really startling!
"
Kyle,"Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
"
Kenny,"(I think we're fucked!)
"
Kyle,"Hey, hey, look at this. 
"
Cartman,"What is it?
"
Kyle,"I don't know. It's old.
"
Stan,"Let's see what's in there.
"
Craig,"""Let's see what's in there."" That's why you guys get into these situations. Because when you come across a spooky, ancient ruin, you say ""Let's see what's in there.""
"
Stan,"It might be a way out, Craig!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 
"
Kyle,"Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
"
Kenny,"(Yeah. Totally.)
"
Stan,"You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
"
Kyle,"Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
"
Stan,"I know, a-and look. 
"
Cartman,"Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
"
Kyle,"Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
"
Stan,"And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
"
Cartman,"Dude, it's Craig!
"
Craig,"What?
"
Kyle,"That is Craig. 
"
Stan,"Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?
"
Craig,"I have no idea.
"
Cartman,"Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
"
Craig,"I don't know.
"
Top Official,"There is now word of huge beehives forming in cities across the U.S. and Canada. Europe and China are reporting deaths by guinea pigs in the tens of thousands.
"
Michael Chertoff,"And how are the efforts to contain all this going?
"
Official 3,"It's bad, sir. It seems we have no way of stopping it; we've lost complete control. 
"
Top Official,"Uh, sir?
"
Michael Chertoff,"Ah I'm sorry, I just thought of a funny joke.
"
Official 1,"Oh, a-hah.
"
Michael Chertoff,"All right, get the jets ready. I need to get to Machu Picchu.
"
Soldier,"Uh, Machu Picchu, sir?
"
Michael Chertoff,"Yes, I need to be taken to Machu Picchu! Have you lost your hearing?!
"
Official 1,"But S-sir, what could possibly be at Machu Picchu to help the-
"
Michael Chertoff,"Am I in charge or not?! 
"
Randy,"We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
"
Sharon,"Can we get out through the highway?
"
Soldier 5,"The highway is unreachable; there's guinea rats all over it.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Guinea rats?
"
Randy,"I'm so startled.
"
Mr. Garrison,"What do you mean ""guinea rats""?
"
Soldier 5,"Look, there are guinea pigs, but there's also guinea bees, guinea rats. I've even seen some guinea spiders out there.
"
Sharon,"Randy, will you stop doing that?! 
"
Stephen,"Look, I I need we need to find a way out under the city.
"
Mr. Garrison,"In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
"
Randy,"Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?
"
A Woman,"Oh my God!
"
Townsman 3,"Something's inside the store!
"
Townsman 4,"Guinea rabbits! They're inside! 
"
Townsman 5,"God they're everywhere!
"
Townsman 6,"Help me!  Help... me... 
"
Townswoman 1,"Travis! No!
"
Randy,"You can't help him!
"
Stephen,"There's something over there!
"
Townsman 7,"It's a guinea bear!
"
Randy,"No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! 
"
Townswoman 2,"Kill me!
"
Sharon,"Randy, the storeroom, we've gotta get to the storeroom! 
"
Shelly,"Mom, I can't see.
"
Randy,"It's okay, Shelly. Daddy's gonna turn on night vision.  There. There. Okay. Gaaah! 
"
Sharon,"What what what what?
"
Randy,"Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! 
"
Stan,"Let's head over this way, guys.
"
Kyle,"Hear that? It sounds like water.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, it's coming from up there.
"
Stan,"Wow. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, that's awesome.
"
Stan,"All right, let's go. 
"
Craig,"No.
"
Stan,"Wait, whattaya mean no?
"
Craig,"I'm not following you guys any more.
"
Stan,"Dude, we we have to go check this out.
"
Craig,"Why?
"
Stan,"'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
"
Craig,"Every time bad things happen, you guys end up putting yourselves deeper into the middle of it, because ""that's just the way it is.""
"
Stan,"Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
"
Craig,"I don't care. I've decided that I'm done. I am choosing not to be a part of this anymore.
"
Kyle,"How do you do that?
"
Craig,"It's easy. Watch. 
"
Stan,"Craig, dude, wait up.
"
Cartman,"Dude, Craig, we should go back now.
"
Craig,"No.
"
Stan,"Hey look, there's something here.
"
Craig,"...Nope.
"
Cartman,"Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
"
Craig,"Yup, nice and boring. Just the way I like it.
"
Randy,"It's been three days now since the guinea pigs and the guinea bees attacked. Guinea rabbits are still everywhere, along with a few guinea panthers. We've taken shelter at the Outback Steakhouse. There's Sharon and Shelly. Say ""hey"" guys.
"
Shelly,"What is that? What is that? 
"
Randy,"I'm gon-, I'm gonna take a look outside! 
"
Randy,"What is it?
"
Husband,"It's a Guineasaurus Rex! 
"
Shelly,"Oh my Gohhhd!
"
Randy,"Oh no, I'm way too startled!
"
Sharon,"Look! 
"
Randy,"Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
"
Sharon,"Randy?! I have had it! You are putting down that God damned camera!
"
Randy,"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 
"
Michael Chertoff,"Wait here a minute.  Behold! I am standing on your precious land! I've waited a long time for this! 
"
Soldier 6,"What's he doing?
"
Michael Chertoff,"What of your prophecy now?! Nothing can stop me!  Craiiig!  No! How did you get here?!
"
Cartman,"Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
"
Soldier 6,"Sir, ih-is everything all right?
"
Michael Chertoff,"Shoot them!
"
Soldier 7,"Shoot them?
"
Michael Chertoff,"They're a Peruvian band that escaped. We must keep them contained.
"
Stan,"No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
"
Michael Chertoff,"I said shoot them!
"
Kyle,"Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
"
Top Official,"Maybe we should look at it, sir.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Damn you Craiiig! You just don't ever stop, do you?!
"
Craig,"I didn't say anything.
"
Michael Chertoff,"You see, for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the Guinea Valley of Peru. The Incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay: by playing pan flute music. Guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do. But the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and I have made that happen! The Incas predicted the world would be saved... by Craig. But that part of the prophecy will not come true! For you will all die on this mountain! 
"
Top Official,"You're, you're some kind of monster.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Oh, I'm much more than that. Guinea bees, guinea rabbits, guineasaurus rexes, I am something much more evil!  Arrrgh.
"
Top Official,"Guinea pirate! 
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
Craig,"Sir, I promise you, I'm not going to ruin your plans. I'll just walk away. See? 
"
Michael Chertoff,"Dargh, no!
"
Craig,"Okay, now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes.
"
Michael Chertoff,"Argh, curse ye, Craig. Dar, argh. 
"
Craig,"My name is Craig Tucker. Last week I stopped a guinea pirate from taking over the earth. All the Peruvian flute bands were released,  and drove the guinea creatures back to the Andes mountains.  Many people had died, but mankind had prevailed.  All over the world, survivors were found, living witnesses to the horror that had been seen.
"
Randy,"Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 
"
Craig,"The guinea pirate lived, but was taken to prison to live out the rest of his days.  And people all over the world learned to support their local Peruvian flute bands, and buy their CDs. For they protect us from the guinea creatures. As for me, I was returned home by Homeland Security.  My parents were sooo happy.  I realized that we don't always have control over what happens to us.  We are but players on the stage of life. And I also learned to never listen when people come asking you for money. 
"
Cartman,"That guy's an asshole!
"
Kyle,"Yeah, what a dick!
"
Kenny,"(I fuckin' hate Craig!)
"
Top Official 2,"Sir! Sir, we have a problem!
"
New Director,"What now?!
"
Top Official 2,"The former director of Homeland Security, that turned out to be a guinea pig? It attacked the guards, got out of its holding cell.
"
New Director,"My God, are you telling me..?
"
Top Official 2,"Yes sir. It broke out of prison. 
"
Obama,"If there is anyone out there tonight who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer. 
"
Randy,"Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
"
Gerald,"Yyeeaahh!!!!
"
Obama,"It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.
"
Randy,"Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!
"
Obama,"Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. We will name him ""Sparkles"".
"
Randy,"He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!
"
Obama,"Where we are met with cynicism, and doubt, and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes We Can.
"
Supporters,"Yes we can!
"
Randy,"Yes I can! Yes I can! 
"
Randy,"Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! 
"
Mr. Harris,"Did you see? Our man is in! 
"
Mrs. Harris,"We did it!
"
Mr. Adler,"Everything is going to be awesome now!
"
Randy,"This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
"
Linda Black,"I don't even know what to do now.
"
Randy,"I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!
"
Crowd,"Looosers! Looosers!
"
Stephen,"Oh, shut up!
"
Crowd,"Looosers!
"
Butters,"We lost?
"
McCain,"It is natural. It's natural tonight to feel some disappointment. We fought as hard as we could, and though we fell short, the failure is mine, not yours.
"
Supporters,"No no! Noo nooo!
"
Butters,"Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
"
Stephen,"No. No, this can't happen! No! 
"
Linda,"Stephen!
"
Stephen,"It's all over, Linda! The country as we know it is about to change. We're all dead.
"
Linda,"You don't know that, Stephen!
"
Mr. Mackey,"With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!
"
Mr. Garrison,"We'll probably be dead by sunrise!
"
Stephen,"Butters, Daddy loves you. Just remember that... he always loved youuu... 
"
Randy,"WOOOO Obama!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Get out o'here!
"
Kyle,"Dude, have you seen my parents? 
"
Stan,"No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
"
Kyle,"He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
"
Reporter 1,"Uh Mr. President, over here!
"
Reporter 2,"Congratulations!
"
Reporter 3,"Great start, great job!
"
Reporter 4,"Change!
"
Reporter 5,"Great job, Mr. President!
"
Reporter 6,"Great job, Obama!
"
Obama,"Thank you all for your support. If you don't mind, I'm gonna spend the rest of the evening getting some much needed rest.  Senator McCain.
"
McCain,"President Obama. 
"
"McCain, Obama","Boom, baby!
"
Obama,"Ohoh man that was perfect! 
"
McCain,"I almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there. That would have screwed us.
"
Obama,"You played it perfectly, there was no way.
"
McCain,"It's McCain, we did it! Obama is President.
"
Davis,"Yeah, so I've heard. You guys are out of your freakin' minds, you know that?
"
McCain,"Yes, we do. Assemble the rest of the team: we've only got ten hours.
"
Davis,"Sure. Hard part's over, right?
"
McCain,"Actually, the hard part's just starting.
"
Reveler 1,"Yoohoo!
"
Reveler 2,"Obama yeah, I can't believe it!
"
Randy,"O ba ma! O ba ma!
"
Revelers,"O ba ma! O ba ma!
"
Randy,"Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  It's Obamobama! 
"
Stan,"Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 
"
Crowd,"Obama!
"
Randy,"Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
"
Crowd,"OooooOOOOooo! 
"
Barbrady,"Okay people, time to disperse. Party's over!
"
Randy,"BOOOO! 
"
Reveler,"...party Obama!
"
Barbrady,"Come on, time to go home.
"
Randy,"What are you? A McCain voter?
"
Crowd,"Yeah!
"
Randy,"Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 
"
Crowd,"Obama! Obama!
"
Randy,"Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
"
Barbrady,"Ey, put down my car! 
"
Revelers,"Yes we can! 
"
Barbrady,"No! No! Hey, stop it!
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ...
"
Randy,"O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 
"
Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 
"
Quincy,"Bravo Obama and McCain. Ten years you two have been working on this plan and you've finally pulled it off!
"
McCain,"Guys, we've all known each other a long time, had many incredible adventures, but this is going to be our greatest feat ever.
"
Neely,"I knew it! I knew when you two ran for President you were just working an angle.
"
Obama,"Always workin' the angles.
"
McCain,"My friends, while the entire country is busy reacting to the election, we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history.
"
Quincy,"So, come on, enlighten us. What are we stealing this time? 
"
Obama,"The Hope Diamond, rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world. Going street value, Middle-Eastern market, of course, two hundred and ten million dollars.
"
Davis,"Two hundred ten?
"
McCain,"Million.
"
Quincy,"No no no, the Hope Diamond is ungettable. Every thief in the world knows that.
"
Obama,"Almost ungettable. The diamond is kept in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built.  The Diamond Wing Is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel. On the northeast side, a seven-five laser system.  There's simply no side of the Smithsonian that can be breached.
"
Davis,"So you go in from the roof, drop into it from the top.
"
Obama,"Can't get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse.
"
Quincy,"Okay, you can't get into the museum from any side and you can't drop in from above, so you can't get the diamond. 
"
McCain,"Meet... the Presidential Escape Tunnel,  A two-mile long underground passage that runs from the White House to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack. The tunnel is only accessible from the Oval Office and just happens to travel right underneath the Smithsonian Natural History Museum.
"
"Neely, Davis","Boom, baby!
"
McCain,"You get somebody into that tunnel, they can blast into the museum, let the others in, the heist is on.
"
Quincy,"So you both run for President because one of you has to win, and you've got your access to the tunnel.
"
McCain,"And we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next... eight hours.
"
Quincy,"This all sounds very risky.
"
Obama,"We've spent ten years putting this plan together. If we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-
"
Neely,"And we are.
"
Obama,"-we won't get caught.
"
Kyle,"Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
"
Stan,"Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Stan,"Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
"
Kyle,"Oh my God! 
"
Kyle,"Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
"
Ike,"Good-bye. 
"
"Stan, Kyle","NOO!
"
Kyle,"Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
"
Chief of Security,"All right, everyone, I'm turning in for the night. Go to standard security, team 3.
"
SS Agent,"Sir! S-sir, we have a bit of a problem.
"
Chief of Security,"What?
"
SS Agent,"The new President-elect is here. Eh he wants into the Oval Office.
"
Chief of Security,"Barack Obama? 
"
SS Agent 2,"They're all, they're all right through here, sir.
"
Chief of Security,"Uh, hello, is there something we can do for you, Mr. Obama?
"
Obama,"Just checking out the new digs. How are you guys?
"
Chief of Security,"Good, sir.
"
Obama,"I'd like to see the Oval Office, please?
"
Chief of Security,"Right now?
"
Obama,"I don't waste time, gentlemen. I've only got two months to figure out how I wanna redecorate, if you know what I mean. You know, change the drapes and stuff.
"
Chief of Security,"Sure, right this way, Mr... President. 
"
Obama,"I will need absolute privacy, is that understood?
"
Chief of Security,"Yes sir. 
"
Obama,"Thanks. 
"
Chief of Security,"I got a hundred dollars. 
"
Obama,"All right, McCain. I'm in.
"
McCain,"Nicely done, B. We're in position outside the Smithsonian.  You find the escape tunnel?
"
Obama,"I'm already on it.  Boom baby.
"
Reveler 3,"Yehhheheah!
"
Randy,"Wooo, change.
"
Reveler 4,"Change.
"
Reveler 5,"Change.
"
Stan,"Dad Dad, we have a problem.
"
Randy,"Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
"
Stan,"No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
"
Randy,"We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
"
Stan,"Dude, he's wasted.
"
Randy,"Hey, it's my boss. Hey boss! 
"
Randy's Boss,"Oh, hello Marsh.
"
Randy,"Yeah, you know what? Fuck you! 
"
Randy's Boss,"Huh?
"
Randy,"You heard me, you fuckin' piece of shit! I can finally tell you what I think o'you, fuckin' asshole!
"
Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?!
"
Randy,"It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
"
Randy's Boss,"Hey, I voted for Obama.
"
Randy,"Obama's not talkin' about you!
"
Kyle,"Can someone help us? My little brother fell out of a window. 
"
Palin,"I just wanna say to everyone who's a little disappointed that we lost the election that there's always next year. Maybe I'll run again for Vice President again in 2009. 
"
Reporter 1,"Uh Mrs. Palin, have you seen or heard from John McCain?
"
Palin,"Uh, uh, nnno, I don't really know where he went. Kinda seems a little odd, I guess, but  Oh, my phone's going ringy. Ex-cuse me.  Hello?
"
McCain,"Hello Sarah, it's McCain.
"
Palin,"I hope to God you're calling to tell me you're in position below the vault with the L7 charges.
"
Obama,"I'm in the tunnel now, Sarah. I should be almost below the museum.
"
Palin,"Just make sure you don't blow the transformers along with the tunnel because it will trigger the five-four laser system! And don't damage any coupling wires or it'll be worthless when Gary shuts down the grid. I'll be there in thirty.
"
Obama,"God she's awesome.
"
Palin,"Oh, I guess Senator McCain's gonna fly me back to Alaska now. He's got a private jet, you know? Okay, byebye then.  Bloody idiots. 
"
McCain,"All right, here we go. 
"
Guard 1,"What's that noise?
"
Guard 2,"It's okay, just some construction outside. 
"
Obama,"Oh no.  McCain? We've got a problem. 
"
Kyle,"Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
"
Stan,"Hey, there's some people. 
"
Stephen,"Let's just stay back- STAY BACK! We don't have any more room in the Ark. 
"
Supporter 1,"You have to let us in! You know the country's doomed!
"
Woman Supporter 1,"Who are you to turn us away?!
"
Stephen,"I built this bunker in case McCain lost! There isn't enough room for everyone!
"
Kyle,"Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
"
Stephen,"I know you do, but there's no more room, I tell ya!
"
Supporter 2,"You're going to deny them too?
"
Supporter 1,"For God's sake, man, they're children!  Look them in the eyes and tell them you won't take them in!  Look at their little cheeks!
"
Stan,"Let go of my face, asshole!
"
Stephen,"All right, damn you! The children can come in!
"
Kyle,"No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
"
Supporter 3,"Okay, then I want their place.
"
Supporter 4,"Me too.
"
Kyle,"We NEED a ride to the hospital!
"
Supporter 1,"THERE ISN'T GONNA BE A HOSPITAL! DON'T YOU GET IT?!
"
Woman Supporter 2,"Let us in now! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!
"
Supporter 5,"Obama hasn't been elected four hours and already the country's going to hell! 
"
Chief of Security,"Mr. Obama?  Sir?  All right, give me the keys. 
"
Obama,"Is there a problem, gentlemen?
"
Chief of Security,"Uh, no. No, sir. Everything okay in there?
"
Obama,"Why wouldn't it be? I'm sorry, but I asked to be left alone?
"
Chief of Security,"Yes, sir, it's, just that... your wife is here.
"
Obama,"My wife?
"
Michelle,"Barack, everyone's been looking for you. What on earth are you doing?
"
Obama,"Uh, c-c-come on in, darling.  Thank, thank you boys. 
"
Michelle,"Okay Barack, tell me what's going on?
"
Obama,"Michelle, there's something I need to tell you.
"
Michelle,"What is it?  Barack, what is it?!
"
Obama,"The laser system guarding the diamond was replaced by an optical relay three days ago.
"
Michelle,"You gotta be kiddin' me. So the entire diamond vault is inaccessible?! Is McCain online?
"
McCain,"Hi, Michelle.
"
Michelle,"You guys weren't runnin' update checks on the security logs?!
"
McCain,"Michelle, we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay.
"
Michelle,"On a new system, in an hour?! Are you nuts? My job was to pretend to be married to this bozo and get you three scan hacks into a laser system!
"
Palin,"Michelle, it's Sarah. They did replace the laser system, but the new one isn't brand-new. It's an old H-7 series. You can break this baby in 30 minutes.
"
Michelle,"Egh. Tell Davis to get me a fortrans emitter and enough pulse drives to light a spark.
"
Obama,"Did you catch that, Davis?
"
Davis,"I'm on it.
"
Kyle,"We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
"
Nurse,"There, just take a seat over there.
"
Kyle,"E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
"
Nurse,"Was he an Obama supporter or a McCain supporter?
"
Stan,"Why does that matter?
"
Nurse,"Because then I'll know if he partied too hard or if he tried to kill himself. 
"
Kyle,"Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
"
Nurse,"You don't understand, kid: there's only two doctors on call, and Dr. Wilson is out celebrating in the streets somewhere.
"
Stan,"So where's the other doctor? 
"
Randy,"Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 
"
Michelle,"I've almost got it. You're only going to have five minutes. Do you understand?
"
Obama,"Did you really not like pretending to be married?
"
Michelle,"Oh Jesus, now is not the time, B.
"
Obama,"Come on. You have to admit we had some fun.
"
Michelle,"My girls need somebody better than a world-class diamond thief. Woowait, there! I got it.
"
Obama,"All right, everyone. We're about to go. So here's the revised schedule: 4:40 a.m., the team gathers at the northwest exit of the museum.  4:45 a.m., Michelle hacks the optical relay, allowing me access to the rear doors.
"
Michelle,"Go! 
"
Obama,"4:46, from inside I can open the doors and let in the rest of the crew.  5:10 a.m., at the Department of Power Quincy shuts down the grid, disabling power to the vault room. 5:12, my grandmother who faked her death on Monday calls in a bomb threat to the museum.
"
Grandma Obama,"I said I put a bomb in your building, bitch.
"
Obama,"5:13, the guards open the southwest door, checking the museum for any bombs.  5:14, McCain, dressed as a football player, enters security and shuts off the diamond case alarm. 
"
A Guard,"Hey you! Stop!
"
Obama,"Michelle and I head back into the tunnel and the hole is patched.  5:15 a.m., I walk out of the Oval Office with the diamond securely hidden in my anus.
"
Obama,"All done. Thanks. 
"
All,"Boom, baby!
"
Quincy,"There's just one thing: don't you think people are going to be suspicious when you disappear? Go looking for you?
"
Obama,"We hired a guy for that a couple of months ago. 
"
Kyle,"What the hell?  Ike?
"
Ike,"Boom, baby.
"
Flight Attendant,"Here are all the tickets for your group, Mr. Sanchez.
"
McCain,"Thank you very much.
"
Quincy,"Well friends, let us depart.
"
Obama,"Hey uh, you guys go ahead. I just came to say goodbye.
"
Neely,"Wha?
"
Obama,"I decided to hang it up, maybe give this President thing a shot.
"
McCain,"B, you can't be serious.
"
Quincy,"Besides, you died in a jet in the Rocky Mountains, remember?
"
Obama,"Could have been I didn't make that flight.  What do you say, Michelle? Would you and your girls like to move into the White House with me? You know, settle down, just be President and First Lady for a while.
"
Michelle,"You're serious.
"
Obama,"Who knows? Maybe we could change a few things. What do you say?
"
Michelle,"Aww, what the fuck. 
"
McCain,"I just looove happy endings.
"
Stephen,"It's still here, ih... it's all still here.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?
"
Stephen,"No, no, I wouldn't say that. It's just maybe... well, uh... maybe Obama will be all right.
"
Randy,"Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
"
Stan,"Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
"
Randy,"Oh!  Ugh, God damn it! Obama said things would be different! That sonofabitch lied to us! I knew I should have voted for McCain! 
"
Cartman,"Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
"
Butters,"Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
"
Kyle,"What's High School Musical 3?
"
Clyde,"You know, the sequel to High School Musical 1 and 2.
"
Stan,"What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
"
Cartman,"There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
"
Jason,"What's High School Musical 1 and... Dude, it's only the most popular thing with kids in our age group!
"
Jimmy,"Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?
"
Craig,"Peru.
"
Bebe,"And then I saw High School Musical 3 again on Friday, and guess who was there? Bridon Gueermo.
"
Millie,"Bridon Gueermo? Oh he's such a dream!
"
Red,"I'd give anything to be with Bridon Gueermo, but he'd never go for me. I'm nobody.
"
Wendy,"That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! 
"
Bebe,"As long as we've got each other, we'll never have any trouble.
"
Girls' Table,"That's what bein' friends is about.
(Oh ye-ah)
Everyone is special in their own way, and we'll always be together as one.
"
Cartman,"What the hell are they doing?
"
Girls' Table,"- Together as one -
"
Stan,"I have no idea. 
"
Girls' Table,"As long as we stick together, together we'll stay.
And every kid in school is special in their own way.
"
Cartman,"Dude, girls are such fags. 
"
Kids,"Oh yeah, oh yeah!
"
Boys,"Boys... are special in their own way.
"
Girls,"Girls... are special like a birthday.
"
Kids,"We'll always be dancin' and singin' aloud. Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh!
"
Heidi,"Here he comes. 
"
A Boy,"I like havin' fun in the hot summer sun (wooo!)
An' groovin' to the beat when my homework is all done. (yeah!)
If you ask me what I know, then you know what I will say?
That every single body is special in their own way.
"
Stan,"Who the hell is that?
"
Butters,"Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
"
Bebe,"He's already seen High School Musical 3 over a hundred times.
"
Kids,"Everyone is special in their own way
"
Bridon,"Special in their own way!
"
Kids,"Move to the beat and let your spirit out!
"
Bridon,"Let it out! Party people!
"
Kids,"As long as we have each other, we'll never have any trouble.
That's what bein' friends is about.
"
Kyle,"Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
"
Stan,"Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
"
Singers,"You've gotta go with the status quo. If you wanna be a regular Joe. (come on now)
And your dreams are only a beat away; don't let 'em tell you no. (tell you no-o-o)
You've gotta go with the status quo. Keep singing 'bout the status quo (keep singing 'bout the status)
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status quo (go with the status quo). That's where we should go. (Go there now)
Copies of pop songs packaged by Disney and turned into a show (into a show).
That's the status quo! That's the status quo (That's the status quo) That's the status quohh!
That's the place we know (get down now)
We're all in our high school dancing on tables singing 'bout what we know (singing 'bout what we know)
We've gotta go with the status quo, go with the status quo. (go with the status)
Go with the status-
"
Cartman,"This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 
"
Stan,"Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
"
Kyle,"They just released part 3 in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"
Cartman,"Well, I'm out guys.  If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done. I no longer have any connection to this world. I'm gonna go home and kill myself. Goodbye, friends.
"
Stan,"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing it.
"
Kyle,"I'm not doing it either. Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(No way in hell I'm doing it.)
"
Stan,"All right, do we promise? We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this. 
"
Kyle,"I swear
"
Kenny,"(I swear too.)
"
Stan,"Okay, good.
"
Cartman,"Ehhhhhhh. 
"
Kyle,"What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
"
Cartman,"I tried. Went to sleep in my mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
"
Stan,"But you didn't die?
"
Cartman,"...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.
"
Wendy,"East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. 
"
Bebe,"As long as we care about each other we can still have some fun.
"
Kyle,"Aw man.
"
Class,"Don't sweat what you might get by assuming the other side as a threat
"
Mr. Garrison,"Oh, you kids. 
"
Class,"Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.
"
Bridon,"East side, west side, doesn't matter to me.
We've gotta learn to power through, set each other free.
"
Wendy,"We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. 
"
"Bridon, Wendy","Each side is right or wrong, we've gotta learn to all get along.
"
Class,"East siiide, west siiide, east siiide...
"
Cartman,"God this sucks!
"
Jimmy,"Do you feel like maybe you're l-l-losin' her, S-Stan?
"
Stan,"I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
"
Jimmy,"M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-
"
Stan,"Stop. 
"
Jimmy,"All righty then.
"
Stan,"Uh, Wendy?
"
Wendy,"Hey Stan.
"
Stan,"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
"
Wendy,"What?
"
Stan,"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
"
Wendy,"Stan, that's ridiculous.
"
Stan,"It is?
"
Wendy,"I would never leave you for Bridon.
"
Stan,"Really?
"
Wendy,"No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. 
"
Jimmy,"There you go. Feel better, p-pal? 
"
Stan,"What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
"
Kids,"Awww. 
"
Stan,"No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.
"
Kids,"Awww. 
"
Butters,"Awww jeez, you're no fun. 
"
Bebe,"Hey Bridon.
"
Bridon,"Hey.
"
Lola,"Hi Bridon
"
Bridon,"Hi.
"
"Heidi, Millie","Hey Bridon.
"
Bridon,"Hey.
"
Stan,"Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
"
Bridon,"Huh?
"
Stan,"Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
"
Bridon,"They are?
"
Stan,"Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.
"
Bridon,"I don't blame 'em. All that singing and dancing? I can't stand it.
"
Stan,"You don't like doing it?
"
Bridon,"It just isn't me. What I really wanna do is just... play basketball.
"
Stan,"Basketball?
"
Bridon,"I love it! Always have. I never miss a game on TV ...when my dad isn't making me rehearse. I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
"
Stan,"Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
"
Bridon,"I can't.
"
Stan,"Yes, you can. What's stopping you?
"
Bridon,"It's my dad. He thinks basketball is for sissies. If I don't do what he wants, he beats me.
"
Stan,"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your dad what you want!
"
Bridon,"Really?
"
Stan,"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents. Go to your dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing, and join the basketball team.
"
Bridon,"You know... you're right. I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight. 
"
Stan,"Sweet.
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Sit up properly, Bridon. You know how strict your father is about posture.  All right dear, dinner's ready!
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Okay, let's eat!
"
Bridon,"Dad, I need to talk to you about somethin'.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Ooo, that sounds emotional!  What is it son? What's on your mind? Whatever it is, you know your dad has the time.
"
Bridon,"No, Dad, can we just talk?
"
Mr. Gueermo,"If you can talk it, you can sing it.  You can lay down the rhythm and bring it! Just put a melody to the words that you're sayin' and sing the beat-
"
Bridon,"Dad, I want to join the basketball team. 
"
Mr. Gueermo,"What did you say?
"
Bridon,"This kid at school today told me I should do what I wanna do. That's what I really wanna do.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Basketball? No son of mine is going to be a sweaty little jock!
"
Bridon,"But Dad, it's what I really want.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"There's no singing and dancing in basketball!
"
Bridon,"I know. That's kind of why I like it.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Don't you even think about it! If I had a jock for a son, I'd be the laughingstock of the men's choir club.
"
Bridon,"It's my life, Dad!
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Don't make me slap you!  I will slap your face so super hard...  I am the man of this house! You disrespect me and you're gonna get slapped!
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Maybe you should let him try it.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"What did you say, woman?!
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"You aren't being fair.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"That's it! I'm gonna slap you!
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"No, please.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"I slap you!
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Ahh!
"
Mr. Gueermo,"I slap you!
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Ohh!
"
Mr. Gueermo,"I slap slap slap you!
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Dohh!
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Slapping you slapping you silly 'cause you disrespected me.
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Ooohohoo.
"
Cartman,"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
"
Kyle,"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
"
Cartman,"Fuck you, Kyle! 
"
Kids,"And you know, we're together at school again.
"
Jimmy,"School again.
"
Stan,"Aww!
"
Kids,"With all of our friends, and you know, we'll be doing this forever.
"
Cartman,"Oh God, shut up!
"
Kids,"Together at school again. What a special day.
"
Cartman,"Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
"
Kids,"We could say that neverrrrrrrrrrr
Goes away.
"
Stan,"Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
"
Bridon,"Yeah, well, my dad blew a gasket when I told him and, then he beat my mom.
"
Stan,"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
"
Mr. Garrett,"Really?
"
Bridon,"Look, I should be getting to class.
"
Mr. Garrett,"Hey, we sure could use you, kid. I could never find enough kids that wanna play ball. All the kids and the school funding go to the theater department.
"
Stan,"You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
"
Bridon,"I don't know...
"
Mr. Garrett,"Look, just come in at recess and shoot some ball with the team.
"
Stan,"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
"
Bridon,"Okay.
"
Mr. Garrett,"Aayy, that's great, Bridon.
"
Bridon,"Thanks.
"
Jason,"We might have a chance at winning now. 
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Bridon! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Bupow! Bupow! Bupow!
"
Bridon,"Dad, I was just messin' around.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"I drove by the school and saw kids on the playground doing a music number and you weren't there! You're here in the sports gym shooting basket hoops!
"
Mr. Garrett,"Eh, your kid is really good at this.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Don't talk to me, stupid jock asshole! 
"
Mr. Garrett,"Just... go easy on him, huh?
"
Mr. Gueermo,"You know what this means? It means you're about to get slapped, so you'd better shut up!
"
Mr. Garrett,"If he wants to play ball, you should let him.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"I'll do it! I'll slap the shit out of you!
"
Mr. Garrett,"He's just a kid.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"You don't tell me how to raise my son! I'll slap it again. 
"
Bridon,"Dad, stop!
"
Mr. Gueermo,"You're trying to turn my son into a little asshole sports person like yourself  There, there's another slap! Maybe you'll think next time you act, you-  Slap it, I'll slap it! 
"
Bridon,"Ow, Dad. Dad, you're hurting me.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Shut up, Bridon! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Get out of my way, Mackey. You wanna piece of this?!  I'll slap everyone in this God damned school if I have to! 
"
Mr. Gueermo,"You are never going to play shooting hoops, do you understand?!  You are going to sing and dance and be the best at it!
"
Bridon,"You're hurting my arm.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Stupid-ass boy!
"
Stan,"Ah, shit.
"
Cartman,"Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
"
Stan,"You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
"
Kyle,"What? Are you crazy?
"
Cartman,"No way dude.
"
Kyle,"We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
Stan,"I know, but... I think we're really starting to become outcasts at school. We're losing all our credibility. I mean, look at who you guys are hanging out with now. Scott Malkinson, for Christ's sake.
"
Scott,"What's so bad about hanging out with me?
"
Cartman,"Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.""
"
Scott,"Hey, don't make fun of my diabetes!
"
Cartman,"""Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" 
"
Stan,"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
"
Kyle,"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
Stan,"That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
"
Scott,"Hey, that was supposed to be my power-up pack.
"
Cartman,"""That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.""
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Yadada yadada yadada dadadadada High School Musical is so awesome. 
"
Male CPS Agent,"Mister... Gueermo?
"
Mr. Gueermo,"What?
"
Male CPS Agent,"We're from Child Protective Services.  There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child?
"
Mr. Gueermo,"What? Who the hell's been saying that?!
"
Female CPS Agent,"We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
"
Male CPS Agent,"His name is Stan Marsh.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"You'd better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car, 'cause there's a world o'hurt about to come your way!
"
Male CPS Agent,"Mr. Gueermo, we need to come in and have a word with your son.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Oh, by all means. You got the balls to come in here?! Do it! Do it! 
"
Male CPS Agent,"Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly.  We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes if that's okay and just maybe... 
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Yeah! There it is! Slapped you! You probably think I'm finished, huh?!  No, there's another one!
"
Female CPS Agent,"Oh my God!
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Don't worry, bitch, I didn't forget about you!  There's a slap for you!  Slap, slap, slap!  Yeah, there you go!  Here's a little reach around the back of the head slap! 
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Oh God, please, you have to get away! He won't ever stop! 
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Awww. I'm going slap-happy!  I'm going slap, slap happy! Slappity slappin' you, teachin' you a lesson for coming in my house!  What are you looking at, Robertson? 
"
Bebe,"They're here! The audition results for the school musical are in! 
"
Butters,"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 
"
Clyde,"Who's the male lead?
"
Butters,"No surprise there. It's Bridon.  I get to be a stand-in! 
"
Wendy,"Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.
"
Bridon,"Yeah, great.
"
Stan,"God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now?

"
Mr. Gueermo,"You hear the rhythm. Now is the time, the tiiiiime. It's time to go to bed. It's time to call it a day. You can reach the stars and-
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Oh please. You have to do something.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"What are you interrupting me for?!
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"It's our son, he's- he's running away.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"What?!  What's going on here, what's this all about?  What do you think you're doing?
"
Bridon,"Dad, I'm sick of you trying to always-
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Nono! Sing it!
"
Bridon,"No! I'm sick of singing!
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Can you believe it? What'd he just say? What's the matter with kids these days? 
"
Mrs. Gueermo,"Kids these days.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Kids these days!  Unh unh unh! Just go right back to your room and sing a ballad, mister!
"
Bridon,"Just let me go.
"
Mr. Gueermo,"Go ahead. Make my day.  You get upstairs, or I will slap you until there's little red hand prints all over face!  Ow!  Oh my God, what was that?  Did you see that?! Oh my God it hurts so bad!  Ow. What the ""H"" is going on?! 
"
Kyle,"Well, I had to see it to believe it!
"
Cartman,"I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
"
Stan,"Actually, this is High School Musical 2. It has a dance-along part.
"
Kyle,"We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)
"
Stan,"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
"
Kyle,"You know what? At least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect! At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave into peer pressure and start doing musicals!
"
Stan,"Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes! Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
"
Scott,"'At's enough, you guysth, it's not cool. Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be-
"
Cartman,"You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
"
Stan,"Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
"
Cartman,"That's a low blow, Stan.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.
"
Mr. Garrett,"All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?
"
Bridon,"I'm ready, coach.
"
Mr. Garrett,"Give 'em hell! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Just a minute to go in the first quarter. 
"
Bebe,"Hey Bridon, how come you weren't at musical rehearsals last night?
"
Bridon,"I joined the basketball team. I gave up singing and dancing forever. I'm just not into it.
"
Wendy,"You gave it up?
"
Stan,"That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
"
Cartman,"But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
"
Stan,"Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
"
Boys,"You've gotta do what you wanna do. Even if other people don't really want you to.
True, girl, you know it's true,  that the thing you wanna do is the thing that you should do.
"
Kyle,"Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
"
Cartman,"And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 
"
Boys,"Do what you wanna do.
Just make sure that what you're doing is what's cool and popular with everyone
Chew, baby, chew and chew.
When you're eating jerky, if eating jerky is what you wanna do.
"
Bebe,"Hey Bridon, can we watch you practice basketball?
"
Bridon,"Uhh, sure. 
"
Kyle,"Do what you want, don't have restraint.
"
Cartman,"Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
"
Kenny,"(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)
"
Stan,"Try to do what you wanna do!
"
Boys,"Do what you wanna do.
As long as what you wanna do is what everybody wants you to.
Glue, baby, buy some glue
Just in case if what you're doin' 
"
Stan,"involves needing scissors and glue!
"
Scott,"Hey guys. Hey guys! 
"
Stan,"Huh? 
"
Kyle,"Where did everybody go?
"
Scott,"The girls all wanted to go watch 'at Bridon kid practice basketball.
"
Stan,"But the girls like singing and dancing.
"
Scott,"No, I think the girls just like that Bridon kid, no matter what he does.
"
Stan,"But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in ""x = y + 1"". Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.
"
Cartman,"Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, now right-click on menu item ""Equate O"" and type in ""input y"".
"
Kyle,"Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
"
Stan,"No, I'm on the Japanese side.
"
Cartman,"Oh, who just shot me? 
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  uhhh, but then what the hell is the...?  Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.
"
Cartman,"U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
"
Butters,"Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
"
Stan,"Dude, what?
"
Butters,"There's vampires in the school!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Butters,"Vampires. I've seen them.
"
Stan,"Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
"
Red,"Not a cheat if you rank up.
"
Butters,"Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
"
Kyle,"Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
"
Butters,"But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
"
Cartman,"All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
"
Butters,"Really? Do you think that's best?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, now get out of here.
"
Butters,"All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
"
Cartman,"Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
"
Lead Vampire,"Isn't this cool? This time of day nobody's in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.
"
Spiky Vampire,"That's an awesome new coat, Mike. Totally badass.
"
Vampir,"Don't call me Mike, my name is Vampir now.
"
Spiky Vampire,"Oh, that's cool.
"
Midnight Vampire,"I'm gonna change my name to Vladimir.
"
Vampir,"You can't; it's too close to Vampir. 
"
Butters,"12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
"
Sparkly Vampire,"You know that girl Bella in Twilight? I think I'm like her. I'm a psi vampire. Do you like the sparkles I got?
"
Butters,"Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
"
Vampir,"Yeah, I'm more a sanguinarian vampire in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.
"
Spiky Vampire,"Hehyeah, I'm gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.
"
Butters,"That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
"
Bloodrayne,"Lunchtime's almost over. Should we drink some more blood?
"
Other Vampires,"Yeah! Cool!
"
Vampir,"Yeah, and then I think it's time for us to feed, per se. 
"
Butters,"Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
"
Tape,"Toot toododoo!  It's the Big Texas Butters show! And now here he is, Big Texas Butters! Why howdy there, partners. I'm Biiig Texas Butters. And this is my horse, Toast. Happy Trails, to youuu.  AAHHH.
"
Vampir,"Ummm, what are you doing?
"
Butters,"Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
"
Bloodrayne,"That kid was really scared of us.
"
Vampir,"That's true, Bloodrayne. People are going to be frightened of us because they don't understand our ways, per se.
"
Spiky Vampire,"Heeyeah, we're cool, huh? 
"
Pete,"What the hell are those kids doing?
"
Henrietta,"Why are they all dressing like that all of a sudden?
"
Pete,"Are they trying to be Goth?
"
Michael,"No, they're vamp. They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.
"
Henrietta,"But they can't dress like that. That's our style.
"
Midnight Vampire,"Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.
"
Vampir,"Tommy Petros? Is he cool?
"
Bloodrayne,"Yeah, he's cool enough.
"
Vampir,"All right. 
"
Pete,"So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it's cool to dress like us?
"
Vampir,"We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.
"
Michael,"Aren't you Mike Makowski?
"
Vampir,"That's Vampir Makowski now.
"
Henrietta,"You kids need to all go put your freakin' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!
"
Sparkly Vampire,"Hey, we're just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!
"
Pete,"Really. Do you guys even smoke?
"
Vampir,"Of course not. Smoking's bad for you.
"
Other Vamps,"Yeah.
"
Pete,"Oh my Gohhd.
"
Vampir,"You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.
"
Pete,"All right, Count Fagula, you just do that. 
"
Butters,"Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin'! You're not gonna believe it!
"
Linda,"Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.
"
Butters,"Oh no, what did I do this time?
"
Linda,"You just march on in there.
"
Butters,"Oh Jeez...
"
Stephen,"You see this, Butters?! It's a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?!  It's Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?!  Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!
"
Butters,"I have no idea, sir.
"
Stephen,"I'll tell you why!  Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!
"
Butters,"Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
"
Stephen,"What keeps a family together, Butters?!
"
Butters,"A well-organized pantry.
"
Stephen,"That's right!  If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong!  Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!
"
Butters,"Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
"
Stephen,"You do it right now or you're going to be grounded! You got that?!
"
Butters,"Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
"
Vampir,"...All mortals share a soft repose,
My soul doth dreadful vigils keep,
More keen than which hell scarcely knows.
"
Sparkly Vampire,"What is that kid doing?
"
Butters,"Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
"
Vampir,"So?
"
Butters,"O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
"
Vampir,"What?
"
Butters,"Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
"
Cowlick Vampire,"You're not cool enough to be one of us.
"
Butters,"Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
"
Vampir,"We'll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.
"
Butters,"Yes! Yes, anything else?
"
Midnight Vampire,"I want some Cheetos.
"
Butters,"Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
"
Singer,"I'm not part of your society. I don't follow your fads and rules. Doctrines...
"
Boy 1,"Where did it go? Do you see where it went?
"
Boy 2,"Yeah, it's right over there by those vampire kids. 
"
Pete,"What? Hey. Hey! We aren't vampire kids, we're freakin' Goths!
"
Boy 1,"Whatever, Dracula, why don't you turn into a bat or something?
"
Michael,"So lame. So... Lame...
"
Henrietta,"You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.
"
Michael,"Sooo lame! 
"
Little Vamp,"See? Isn't it cool back here? It's all dark and isolated.
"
Shades Vamp,"This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.
"
Henrietta,"Get out of our space, you little twerps!
"
Pete,"More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?
"
Butters,"I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
"
Vampir,"You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?
"
Butters,"Yeah, I guess.
"
Vampir,"Are you sure? Because once you're in South Park Vampire Society, you can't ever leave.
"
Butters,"Well I'm sick of bein'- pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.
"
Vampir,"Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin!  This way. Prepare thyself. 
"
Butters,"Whoa.
"
Vampir,"And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se!  With this thy transformation is done. 
"
Butters,"Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 
"
Vampir,"It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. 
"
Stephen,"There you are, Butters! Do you know what time it is?! Where have you been?! 
"
Linda,"Butters, what have you done to your hair? 
"
Stephen,"Hey! Butters, we are talking to you! Explain yourself, mister! 
"
Butters,"I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
"
Linda,"What on Earth?
"
Stephen,"That does it! You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!
"
Butters,"You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
"
Stephen,"All right, I don't know what's gotten into you, mister, but you're gonna-  Ah!
"
Linda,"Butters? 
"
Butters,"I am going to my room now! For I must slumber, per se. 
"
Principal Victoria,"Now, kids, I understand that you are very into this ""vampire"" thing, but I don't want to see it get out of hand. You kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some.
"
Pete,"...Oh my God. You've got the wrong flippin' people.
"
Michael,"We aren't vampires.
"
Principal Victoria,"I know that you aren't really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the ""in"" thing right now, but-
"
Pete,"We aren't trying to be popular!
"
Principal Victoria,"-but just make sure that this new little trend doesn't become a distraction. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay.
"
Vampir,"Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?
"
Principal Victoria,"I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-
"
Michael,"We aren't friends!
"
Vampir,"Don't worry, Ma'am. As I was just explaining to my new minions, vampires are actually very spiritual and deep beings, per se.
"
Michael,"Allison Merch is a vampire kid now? This thing isn't going to stop.
"
Pete,"Let's just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone's gonna think we're trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin' Gap and just buy normal clothes. 
"
Pete,"Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. 
"
Boy 1,"It went this way?
"
Boy 3,"Yeah, it's over there by that fat girl, the big-nosed kid, the midget, and the kid with pock marks on his face. 
"
Michael,"So we're back to that, are we?
"
Firkle,"Shit.
"
Pete,"Let's get out of these freakin' Gap clothes.
"
Butters,"Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
"
Cartman,"Butters?  Butters?! 
"
Butters,"I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
"
Cartman,"Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
"
Butters,"I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
"
Cartman,"Dude! 
"
Liane,"You all right, sweetie?
"
Butters,"U-huh.  Ow.
"
Liane,"What's going on?
"
Cartman,"Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
"
Liane,"Oh dear.
"
Cartman,"Yes.
"
Michael,"I walked into the cafeteria today. Rebecca Miller and Philip Russ were dressed like vampires drinking Clamato juice with four kids from the football team.
"
Firkle,"Jesus.
"
Pete,"It's like, there's more vampire kids every freakin' day. Why is this happening. I mean, why now?
"
Michael,"Doesn't matter why. Pretty soon, the whole school is going to be an endless hive of conformist happy-go-lucky vampire wannabes.
"
Henrietta,"It seems like that preppy Mike Makowski kid started all this. Maybe he's the way to stopping it.
"
Pete,"Whattaya mean?
"
Henrietta,"I mean, what do you do when you want to change vampires back to normal? You get rid of the head vampire.
"
Pete,"Does your mom know you took her car?
"
Henrietta,"Do I care?
"
Michael,"All right, this is probably good enough.
"
Pete,"Yeah, pull over here. 
"
Vampir,"(Please, what do you want?! Let me go!)
"
Michael,"What should we do with him?
"
Pete,"Well, if he's a vampire, I guess we should drive a stake through his heart.
"
Vampir,"(No! I'm not really a vampire! I'm not a vam-, I'm not a vampire!)
"
Michael,"What's that?
"
Vampir,"(I'm not really a vampire.)
"
Michael,"You're not really a vampire? Really? I'm so freaking shocked. 
"
Pete,"If we get the right packaging, we can just Fedex him somewhere far way.
"
Michael,"How about we send him to Transylvania?
"
Pete,"No, he'd probably see it as something to brag about someday to his little vampire buddies.
"
Henrietta,"If we're gonna send him somewhere, it should be the most horrible, most miserable place on Earth.
"
Goths,"Scottsdale.
"
Linda,"Butters, we just got a call from Mrs. Cartman. Butters?  Unbelievable! He's locked the door. 
"
Stephen,"Butters, this is your father! Explain why you snuck into another boy's bedroom and gave him a hickey!  Butters?! Butters, you will open this door right now!
"
Butters,"What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
"
Stephen,"Butters, you have five seconds to unlock this door!  One! Two!  Uhh, Bu-Butters?
"
Butters,"Hey Dad. 
"
Stephen,"AAAARH! Buh. Bu-Butters, did you get gay with one of your schoolmates tonight?!
"
Butters,"I have to eat! But I can't do it. I'm getting weak.
"
Stephen,"All right! Now you listen, and you listen good! Until you stop behaving this way, you are not going to leave this room! Do you understand?!
"
Butters,"Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
"
Linda,"Stephen, what has happened to our boy?
"
Stephen,"He's become something, Linda. Something that... we cannot ground.
"
Michael,"I just. Don't. Get it. We sent the head vampire kid to Scottsdale, but still more and more kids are dressing up like vampires.
"
Henrietta,"He must not have been what was causing it. It must be something else.
"
Waitress,"Hey you kids gonna order any food or just sit there and drink coffee all night again? 
"
Henrietta,"Leave us alone!
"
Waitress,"Bad enough I always get stuck with you Goth kids, now I got Goth kids in my entire section. 
"
Pete,"They aren't Goth! They're douchey little vampire kids!
"
Waitress,"Looks the same to me.
"
Pete,"I bet they aren't even drinking coffee.
"
Waitress,"No, they said they're too young to drink caffeine, so they're havin' orange juice. 
"
Henrietta,"Let's go over there and tell them they're not taking Village In from us too.
"
Pete,"Forget it! It's over, all right? There's too many of them now. We can't stop them. Let's just face it. The freakin' vampires beat us.
"
Butters,"Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
"
Henrietta,"Get away, douchebag.
"
Butters,"Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
"
Pete,"What are you talking about?
"
Butters,"I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
"
Pete,"Awww, Hot Topic? When did this open?
"
Butters,"Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
"
Michael,"Of course. Freaking Hot Topic. That explains everything.
"
Pete,"How did we not figure that out? Of course a new Hot Topic must have come to town. Duh!
"
Henrietta,"Well, I think we all know what has to be done.
"
Michael,"Yup.
"
Pete,"Let's get to it. 
"
Singer,"Burn down down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it steal your soul away.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Light the fire. Take control.
Burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
Don't let it take your soul.
Burn down, burn down, burn down Hot Topic.
And take control.
Burn down... Hot Topic.
Burn it down... Hot Topic.
"
Clerk,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
"
Pete,"You should probably get out of here. 
"
Spiky Vamp,"What the hell are they doing??
"
Butters,"They're putting an end to it! 
"
Clerk,"AAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
Butters,"Mom, Dad!  I changed back!
"
Stephen,"What?
"
Butters,"Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
"
Linda,"We have no idea what you're talking about, Butters, but we're glad you're home.
"
Stephen,"That's right son. There's only one thing I care about.
"
Butters,"What's that, Dad?
"
Stephen,"Well, would you mind telling me why there's Rice-A-Roni in my coffee?!
"
Butters,"Uh oh.
"
Stephen,"Butters, you are grounded!
"
Butters,"Ahh, dangit! 
"
Stephen,"It worked, Linda. Our son is groundable once more. 
"
Pete,"Fellow students. Over the past week there's been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black 'cause it's ""fun"", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. 
"
Michael,"Fuck all of you.
"
Character,Line
Cartman,"Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
"
Stan,"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, it's just so astounding.
"
Cartman,"Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.
"
Craig,"Yeah, a fifth-grade girlfriend.
"
Kyle,"This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
"
Jimmy,"Well, so, w-who is she?
"
Cartman,"Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
"
Butters,"Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Butters,"Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
"
Stan,"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
"
Butters,"Um, does Kenny like her?
"
Kyle,"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
"
Butters,"Oh, no. Oh, geez!
"
Cartman,"Butters, what's the problem?
"
Butters,"Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Butters,"It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
"
Cartman,"That bitch! Kenny gave his heart to her, and she's just gonna throw it in his face!
"
Jimmy,"Well, Kenny deserves to know, fellas. If you guys found out my girlfriend was a raging whore, I'd want you to t-tell me.
"
Stan,"All right, come on, guys. 
"
Butters,"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
"
Girl 1,"So, anyway, I passed him a note, but then Johnny... 
"
Stan,"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! 
"
Kenny,"(Oh, hi, guys.)
"
Stan,"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
"
Kenny,"(What about her?)
"
Stan,"Oh, boy.
"
Kyle,"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
"
Kenny,"(But what?)
"
Kyle,"W-well, we've heard that she's...
"
Cartman,"Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
Cartman,"Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
"
Kenny,"(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) 
"
Cartman,"He took it pretty well.
"
Kenny,"(Hey, Tammy!)
"
Tammy,"Hi, Ken. You decide what you wanna do after school?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
"
Tammy,"TGI Friday's?
"
Kenny,"(Yep. I like the food!)
"
Tammy,"Yeah, okay. But...  Kenny. Listen. Uh, there's somethin' I need to talk to you about. There's a lot of rumors goin' around about me, that I agreed to give a boy a B.J.? Well, it's true.  But it was before you and I were together, and it wasn't my fault!  See, I was watchin' the Disney Channel, and that show came on with the Jonas Brothers.
"
Kenny,"(Jonas Brothers?)
"
Tammy,"You know that teenage boy band? Every time I see them I get so tingly. I just completely lose control.  And then Dave Darsky showed up and took me to TGI Friday's,  and it just happened. But it was only for one second, and I had my eyes closed. I know it's terrible. Can you... can you forgive me, Ken? 
"
Clerk,"There you are, young man. Two tickets to the Jonas Brothers concert.
"
Kenny,"(Thanks.) 
"
Cartman,"The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
"
Kyle,"Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah. Tammy said if I got her the tickets for the concert, she would give me a B.J.!)
"
Stan,"A B.J.?
"
Kyle,"You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
"
Kenny,"(Of course, dude!)
"
Cartman,"Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
"
Stan,"Yeah, dude, that's gross.
"
Kenny,"(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
"
Kyle,"What kind of protection?
"
Kenny,"(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)
"
Clerk 2,"Box of condoms. Certainly, little boy. What kind would you like?
"
Kenny,"(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)
"
Clerk 2,"These here? Why, certainly. 
"
Kenny,"(Cool!) 
"
Kyle,"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
"
Kenny,"(No, I'm not young and I want a B.J.)
"
Cartman,"Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
"
Kenny,"(Yep! Woo-hoo!) 
"
Tammy,"Go, baby! Whoooo! Kenny, you're the best for bringing me here. Isn't this awesome? 
"
Joe Jonas,"I'm ready to get it on.
But there's no gettin' on until I'm ready.
Too soon, slow down.
Take it easy, oh, my girl, I need your love. Bay-bay!
"
Jonas Brothers,"I can't wait till the day I kiss you.
Until then I have to tease you.
'Cause my mom doesn't like it when I'm naughty.
She'll make me clean my room if I'm naughty.
"
Joe,"Bay-bay! I'm hot.
"
Nick Jonas,"He's hot.
"
Little Girl,"My 'giney tickles! 
"
Tammy,"Oh, my God. It's that tingling again.  I love you! 
"
Joe,"Tell me how was I to know?
"
Jonas Brothers,"You'd take your love and go.
"
Joe,"Was it 'cause I wanted to wait till we were married...
"
Jonas Brothers,"To put my arm around you?
"
Joe,"The seasons change.
"
Kevin Jonas,"Bay-bay!
"
Joe,"And the world goes round.
"
Nick,"The world goes round and round and round.
"
Jonas Brothers,"Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna take my time.
Can't wait 'til you are mine, but it might be a while. 'Cause,
yeah yeah, girl, we can take it slow, so we have room to grow.
And then someday we can get it on.
Until then, go back to Montreal.
"
Joe,"'Cause I still love you, bay-bay!
"
Nick,"Love you, bay-bay!
"
Kevin,"Bay-bay!
"
Tammy,"Whoooooo!  Aaah-oww!  You're so hot, Kevin! I love you, Joe!
"
The Jonas Brothers,"Good night, Denver. We love you all!  We love you, Denver!  Good night! 
"
Tammy,"Oh, my God, I am so worked up! I just want to attack you, Kenny!
"
Kenny,"(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 
"
Usher,"And, uh, you too, little girl in the red.
"
Tammy,"Huh?
"
Usher,"Band would like you to come backstage. You, too, little girl in the puppy T-shirt. 
"
Tammy,"They want me to come backstage? Oh, my God!
"
Kenny,"(Look, they're nothing, but...)
"
Tammy,"It's a dream come true! 
"
Kenny,"(Hey!)
"
Usher,"All right, right this way, girls.
"
Roadie,"Yeah, come on in everyone. The band is waiting for you.  Uh, not you. 
"
Kenny,"(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)
"
Roadie 2,"The Jonas Brothers will be right out, girls. 
"
Girl in Puppy T-shirt,"Why do you think they called us back here?
"
Fat Girl,"They must've wanna have sex with us.
"
Tammy,"What? You think so?
"
Fat Girl,"Sure, they're a band. They called us back here so we can give them blowjobs.
"
Girl in Puppy T-shirt,"Well, I'm not doing it! Just 'cause they're rock stars doesn't mean I'll do that!
"
Girl in O T-shirt,"Yeah, I'm not giving a blowjob to anybody!
"
Tammy,"Me neither. 
"
Jonas Brothers,"Hey, there, girls! 
"
Joe,"Hey, listen, we saw you out there in the audience.
"
Nick,"Yeah, you were getting a little crazy out there.
"
Fat Girl,"Let's just get to the blowjobs.
"
Joe,"Blow what?
"
Kevin,"I don't know.  Look, we called you back here because we want to share our love of Christ with you
"
Nick,"And see if you'll wear purity rings from now on.
"
Tammy,"Purity rings?
"
Joe,"We all wear purity rings. It means we are going to be pure and not have sex until we're married.
"
Kevin,"And it means we stay away from bad stuff and avoid people who swear and watch naughty TV shows.
"
Nick,"That's just how we roll.
"
Kevin,"Yeah.
"
Nick,"Yeah. 
"
Joe,"So, what do ya say, girls? You wanna be kid hipsters like us and wear purity rings too?
"
The Girls,"Okay.
"
Kevin,"And be sure to give a ring to all the kids you care about, 'cause it's the hip new way to roll.
"
Cartman,"Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
"
Stan,"So how did it go last night? 
"
Kyle,"What's that?
"
Kenny,"(A purity ring.)
"
Cartman,"Purity ring?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)
"
Kyle,"...Well, what does that mean?
"
Kenny,"(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
"
Stan,"Dude, you? We thought you really wanted to have a BJ before you got too old an-
"
Kenny,"(I did! I was really excited to get a B.J. but now I have to wear this motherfucking purity ring!)
"
Kyle,"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 
"
Butters,"Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, but it's okay Butters. They have purity rings now.
"
Butters,"Uh, what's that?
"
Stan,"They're rings that says they're not gonna have sex or do anything naughty anymore.
"
Butters,"Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
"
Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
Can't just do whatever I feel like, I've got to stay right, just and true.
I can't hang out with my buddies and get into trouble, 
'Cause now we're both wearing these rings for each other.
But who needs sex and drugs and partying 
When we can cook a meal, then sit around and watch Netflix...
Bay-bay!
I've got a ring on my finger to remind me that I must behave.
No need to chase after girls; it's a promise I can never break.
I made a commitment and it is forever, 
So we can spend every waking minute together.
And if we get bored it won't be a problem, 
'Cause we can just hang out with other couples who wear these rings...
Bay-bay!
"
Purity Boy 1,"Yeah, we found out that once you wear purity rings, it's best to hang out with other couples that do. Got more in common. Isn't that right, Sarah?
"
Purity Boy 2,"You know? What Carole and I enjoy is Grey's Anatomy. We love Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Carole?
"
Purity Boy 3,"We adore Grey's Anatomy, don't we, Nancy?
"
Nancy,"Adore it. Kenny and Tammy, do you watch Grey's Anatomy?
"
Purity Boy 1,"We look forward to it all week long. 
"
Purity Boy 3,"Sure is sweet.
"
Purity Boy 1,"It's the most fun I've had in weeks. 
"
Jonas Brothers,"I've got a ring on my finger to remind me what I cannot do.
What I cannot do.
Bay... bay...
Baaay...
Baybay.
Baybay.
Baaaybaaaaay.
"
Director,"Aaand cut. Great video shoot, guys.
"
Joe,"This is bullpucky!
"
Kevin,"Yeah, we've had it, Goshdarnit!
"
Director,"Uh oh, looks like we've got a problem.
"
Joe,"Our decision is final! We have decided, as a band, not to wear purity rings anymore!
"
Kevin,"Yeah, you tell 'em, Joe.
"
Disney Exec 1,"Boys, I know you're tired, but the purity rings are important to the company's image.
"
Joe,"We don't care about the company.
"
Director,"And you're gonna say that to the boss's face?
"
Kevin,"We aren', we aren't afraid of him.
"
Disney Exec 2,"Well, I hope you're right, because the boss is on his way here. Now.
"
Disney Exec 3,"Oh Jesus, he's here. The boss is here!
"
Kevin,"Let's be strong, guys.
"
Disney Exec 3,"Hello sir. How was your trip? 
"
Mickey,"What's all this I'm hearing about not wearing the purity rings, haha?
"
Director,"Uh we'll just leave you alone. 
"
Mickey,"So uh, I guess we have some issues, haha?
"
Kevin,"We... need to talk about something.
"
Mickey,"Oh boy! I just love flying all the way to Colorado to hear about your problems, haha.
"
Joe,"Look, we just want our concerts to be about our music, and not about purity rings.
"
Mickey,"Oh Gosh, fellas, let me explain this to you one more time. You have to wear the purity rings because that's how we can sell sex to little girls, haha. See, if we make the posters with little girls reaching for your junk, then you have to wear purity rings or else Disney Company looks baaad, haha.
"
Joe,"Well we don't wanna be selling sex to little girls anymore.
"
Mickey,"The rings stay on!
"
Joe,"Well, well, maybe we'll just refuse to go onstage. 
"
Mickey,"You don't... Fucking..Talk to me. Like that, haha. You little... piece of... shit, Haha!  Get the fuck up. Get the fuck up! Haha.  Now, do we have a problem?! Haha.
"
Nick,"No, sir.
"
Kevin,"No, Mr. Mouse.
"
Joe,"No, Mr. Mouse.
"
Mickey,"Oh, that's good, 'cause I thought we had a problem for a minute there, haha.  Alright now, get out there and make me some Goddamned money! Haha. 
"
Kyle,"Yup, he's in here. 
"
Stan,"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
"
Kyle,"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
"
Kenny,"(Look at this. More DVDs.) 
"
Cartman,"Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
"
Stan,"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
"
Cartman,"Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
"
Stan,"You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)
"
Stan,"You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
"
Kyle,"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!
"
Stan,"What? 
"
Cartman,"""Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
"
Kyle,"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
"
Stan,"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
"
Kyle,"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
"
Kenny,"(Yeah...)
"
Announcer,"Live from Five News Studio in Colorado, it's Good Mornin' Denver.
"
Host,"We are joined this morning by the Disney supergroup the Jonas Brothers. Hello boys. 
"
Joe,"Hello.
"
Host,"Now, tell us what you're doin' here in Denver, guys.
"
Joe,"Uh, we're gonna be doin' a live concert from Red Rocks tonight that will be live-broadcast on the Disney Channel.
"
Mickey,"In 3-D. Don't forget to mention in 3-D.
"
Kevin,"Oh, oh-and it's gonna be in 3-D. 
"
Host,"Now, guys, a lot has been made about your ""purity rings"". Can you tell us about those?
"
Joe,"Well. Um.  We, we wear these to symbolize how pure we are and how we ...um don't approve of things that are naughty or filthy.
"
Mickey,"Yeah, that's good. Get a close-up on their purity rings. Close-up on the purity rings, haha. 
"
Host,"That's wonderful, boys.  It's good that little girls can see a concert and not have it be about sex. We understand that at the concert tonight you'll be dousing girls in the audience with white foam. Is that correct?
"
Nick,"Uh huh.
"
Joe,"Yeah. Uh huh.
"
Kevin,"Yeah.
"
Nick,"Yeah.
"
Host,"Well can you give our audience a peek?  What do you say girls? Do you want the Jonas Brothers to douse you with their white foam? 
"
Mickey,"Oh boy! This is TV gold, haha. 
"
Stan,"Excuse us. Excuse us.
"
Girl 2,"Hey, what do you think you're doing?!
"
Host,"That's great stuff, boys. You like takin' the Jonas Brothers' hot foam in your faces, girls?
"
Cartman,"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
"
Stan,"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
"
Joe,"Huh?
"
Kyle,"What the hell do you think you're doing spreading this crap to kids?!
"
Mickey,"Who the hell are these guys?  Are they from DreamWorks? Goddamn Eisner trying to hurt this company again, haha?
"
Cartman,"This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
"
Kyle,"Cartman?
"
Mickey,"You aren't ruining my plans this time, DreamWorks, haha! 
"
Stan,"Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa? 
"
Kyle,"Dow... 
"
Voice 1,"Fifteen minutes, that's fifteen minutes, people!
"
Voice 2,"Get another mic on that dronk kid.
"
Mickey,"They almost ruined everything, haha. How did something like this happen, haha?  Wake up. Wake up, you little prick! Haha.  Who do you work for? DreamWorks?  Answer me, haha!
"
Stan,"We... don't work for any-body.
"
Mickey,"Oh boy, I sure believe that, haha.  You just tried to ruin Disney Company's big night for your own amusement, huh?! Haha.
"
Cartman,"The hell did you do to us?!
"
Mickey,"SHUT UP!  Haha.
"
Announcer,"And now, Disney Channel presents... the Jonas Brothers 3-D concert spectacular!  Live from Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado! 
"
Male Host,"Truly a night of magic as we're set for the biggest concert event of the year!
"
Female Host,"In about ten minutes, the Jonas Brothers are going to take the stage in what Disney is calling ""the most pure and innocent rock event of the millennia.""
"
Blonde Girl,"Do we put the 3-D glasses on now, da-da?
"
Father,"Not yet, Katie.
"
Male Host,"Everyone around the country is tuning in to see Disney's latest kid pop stars.
"
Kenny,"(And not getting a blowjob...)
"
Male Host,"We understand the Jonas Brothers are getting ready. What's going on backstage must be exciting.
"
Mickey,"You'd better start talkin', haha!  You'd better start talkin' right now, haha!
"
Stan,"We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
"
Kyle,"We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
"
Mickey,"You're lying! I'll cut you up, haha!
"
Joe,"You see? We were right about the purity rings! A nice Christian symbol can't be used for profit gains.
"
Kevin,"We've all angered God.
"
Mickey,"You think God is in control here, haha?! I am in control! I've been in control since the '50s in case you haven't noticed, haha!  You three faggots are going onstage, and  YOU three faggots aren't going to stop me! NOBODY IS RUINING THIS EVENT!! Haha. I've worked too long and too hard to have anybody  fuck this up!  Where would you be without me, Jonas Brothers? Haha. Your music sucks and you know it! Haha. It's because you make little girls' 'ginies tickle! And when little girls' 'ginies tickle, I make money! Haha. And that's because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I'm selling sex to their daughters! I've made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?!  Because Christians are retard-ed! Haha.  They believe in a talking dead guy! Haha.  Ohhh. Haha. Hello, folks.
"
Audience,"BOOO!!
"
Mickey,"Now now, take it easy, haha. Here's the Jonas Brothers.
"
Joe,"Come on guys. 
"
Mickey,"No! Stop! Bring them back here!
"
Roadie,"It's over, Mr. Mouse. Everyone's tuning out.
"
Mickey,"NO! NO GODDAMNIT! NO! SHUT UP! SHUT! UP! AAAAAAGH! 
"
Father,"That's it girls. No more Disney TV for a while.
"
Reporter,"Tom, the Disney Jonas Brothers 3D Television Special has failed, costing the Disney Company millions, and once again Mickey is pissed off and throwing a fit.
"
Mickey,"Vengeance is mine! You are all ants and I am your destroyer, haha.
"
Reporter,"The Disney purity ring venture will now most likely prove a marketing bust, as Mickey returns to Valhalla to slumber and feed. 
"
Tammy,"Aw Ken, look what we've become. We're way too young to be this boring.
"
Kenny,"(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
"
Tammy,"No! I don't want to watch Grey's Anatomy, Ken. Let's take off these rings, Ken.
"
Kenny,"(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)
"
Tammy,"Let's take them off and just be kids again. There'll be plenty of time to wear rings and be boring and lame when we reach our late 30s and we're boring and lame anyway.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah. Screw this crap!) 
"
Tammy,"Oh I feel better already!
"
Kenny,"(Me too!)
"
Tammy,"What say you and me... go to T.G.I. Fridays?
"
Kenny,"(Woo-hoo!!) 
"
Father Maxi,"And so, as we commit this young child to the earth, let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease, and it can be caught even if using protection. This young boy learned the hard way that there's no guarantee... For the world of oral sex is a world...
"
Cartman,"I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
"
Kyle,"Well, now we know.
"
Cartman,"And knowing is half the battle.
"
Cartman,"The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap. It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. Bad economy made things worse.  The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down.  Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things.  He didn't.  As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. The city needs protection.  There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage.  To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man.  I'm the hero this town needs. I am...  the Coon!  As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 
"
Josh,"Lisa I had a really great time tonight.
"
Lisa,"I did too, Josh.
"
Josh,"Would you... mind very much if kissed you?
"
Lisa,"Not at all. 
"
The Coon,"A woman being raped. This is what our city has been reduced to. When the money goes, the raping starts. Women are helpless... without the Coon.
"
Lisa,"O-hoh, yes Josh. Yehehessss!
"
The Coon,"Let her go!
"
Josh,"'Scuse me?
"
The Coon,"You aren't raping anyone tonight!
"
Josh,"Oh, it's a talking squirrel.  Oh!
"
Lisa,"Ah!
"
Josh,"Oh! Ow! Wugh! Oh!
"
The Coon,"Get out of here! Get to safety! 
"
Josh,"Ugh! L-lisa! Call me! Oh! Ow!
"
The Coon,"Another woman saved from rape. But how many more rapists are out there?
"
Josh,"Oh that really stings.
"
Officer 1,"Here's that file on the Rodriguez case, detective.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Alright, things are pretty quiet out there, boys. Let's try to get caught up on some paperwork. Murphy I want you to- 
"
The Coon,"Don't let the city's peacefulness fool you, commissioner! It's too quiet.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Oh, not this kid again.
"
Officer 1,"Hey, you get out of here. Out.
"
The Coon,"There was another rapist in the park tonight.  It's no coincidence. It must be a rapist plot and at stinks to the top.
"
Sgt. Yates,"What?
"
The Coon,"I think the Mayor might be involved. It's my theory she might have a lesbian lover who's holding her leash.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Jesus Christ,  can we get a lock on that window?  Look kid, you need to stop- 
"
Officer 1,"He's gone.
"
The Coon,"No, I'm just over here now.  What do we know about the Mayor's sexual preferences?
"
Sgt. Yates,"Alright, listen: you have five seconds to leave or we're gonna put you in the jail and call your parents!
"
Officer 1,"Jail's full, sir.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Whatever. Then we'll just put you in- 
"
The Coon,"Now I'm back over here.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Just get out of here before we-! 
"
The Coon,"I'm right here now. 
"
Sgt. Yates,"All right, stop it!
"
The Coon,"Yes, I have to go now.  But in the meantime I have something that might interest you.  Make sure all your men get a look at these, detective!
"
Sgt. Yates,"What's in here? 
"
Cartman,"Hey guys. Good morning.  You guys... hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night? They say it was the Coon.
"
Stan,"Who's the Coon?
"
Cartman,"I know, right?  ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
"
Kyle,"...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
"
Cartman,"You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
"
Kyle,"...Dude, what?!
"
Cartman,"He's not a fag!
"
Kyle,"Why do you care?
"
Cartman,"Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?
"
Cartman,"And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
"
The Coon,"Sometimes it seems the more criminals I try to stop, the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars. The city is a dying whore. She calls out to me to save her. And I don't know if I can. But she is still my city.  And I cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are-  Who the hell is that?  Who the hell are you?
"
M,"I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets, I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs.
"
The Coon,"Aw nonononono, I am the symbol this town needs!  Dude, seriously, you can't do that! Go home! I was, I was doing this first!
"
M,"Nuh uh.
"
The Coon,"Yeah huh! You heard of the Coon and now you're being a copycat. Is that your name? Copycat?
"
M,"I am Mysterion.
"
The Coon,"Mysterion? That's fucking retarded! You just gave yourself away, Craig! Only you would think of a name that dumb!
"
Mysterion,"I might be Craig, and then again I might not be. My identity must remain a secret. You cannot know.
"
The Coon,"Yeah? Well you cannot know my true identity either.
"
Mysterion,"I assume you must be Cartman, because you're fat.
"
The Coon,"Well you're wrong! I'm not Eric Cartman and he's not fat! Care to guess again?!
"
Mysterion,"I really don't care who you are.
"
The Coon,"Oh all right Kyle! Yeah, took me real long to figure it out! Only you, Kyle, would be a buzzkill, and try to steal my thunder! You don't care about stopping crime, you're just doing this... 'cause you hate me, Kyle!
"
Mysterion,"Kyle hates Eric Cartman. Are you saying you're Eric Cartman?
"
The Coon,"No, I'm no- I  I'm sayin' that... Goddammit Stan is that you? It is you, isn't it? Clyde? Clyde, you're not a superhero, I am!
"
Mysterion,"I cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer. The city needs my help. There are innocents to protect. 
"
The Coon,"NO! Dude, I'm seriously! You're being a copycat! I'll sue you!  Motherfucker!
"
Cartman,"Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
"
The Coon,"How is it that nobody came to Coonicon 09? This is just, this is fucking ridiculous!
"
Maitre D,"Got everything you need here, sir? Okay on beverages, buffet items?
"
The Coon,"Yes, it's fine!
"
Maitre D,"Great. Hey, I just want to say that the Airport Hilton really appreciates your continued business.
"
The Coon,"What do you mean ""continued""? You don't know who I am!
"
Maitre D,"Aren't you that little boy who had his ginger pride rally and his AIDS benefit here, before?
"
The Coon,"No, I'm not that kid!
"
Maitre D,"Oh. Oh oh really? Oh my bad. I'm actually relieved. That kid was kind of a douchebag.
"
The Coon,"You're a fucking douchebag! Get outta here!
"
Cartman,"Hunh!
"
Liane,"Oh, hello sweetie. What did you do today?
"
Cartman,"I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
"
Liane,"Aww, what happened, hun?
"
Cartman,"I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
"
Anchor,"Tonight an incredible story of an unknown child in South Park who has taken to the streets in an effort to fight crime.
"
Cartman,"Wha, what?
"
Anchor,"But who exactly is... Mysterion? 
"
Cartman,"What?!
"
Anchor,"Curious crowds in the town of South Park, Colorado.  They've brought binoculars and camera phones trying to get a shot of a mysterious superhero.
"
Man 1,"Uh, he was dressed mostly in black with a kind of... cloak.
"
Woman 1,"He jumped down from the fire escape stairs, and then he just ran off. We barely got a look at him.
"
Man 2,"To me it looked like Mysterion to me. Everyone who's seen Mysterion, say yeah!
"
Crowd,"Yeah! 
"
Man 3,"Well I, I think he's kind of a symbol for the town, you know? A, a symbol.that everyone who's sick of crime can uh can rally behind.
"
Cartman,"Fuckin' butthole!
"
Man 4,"Well if you ask me, he's a menace. There's no room for vigilantism in today's world!
"
Reporter,"This artist rendition of Mysterion has already generated thousands of copies.
"
Cartman,"You gotta be kidding me!
"
Reporter,"As hundreds of people to try and get a glimpse of the superhero, one question remains: Who is Mysterion? 
"
Anchor,"If you have any idea about the true identity of Mysterion, please call the 9 News Hotline.
"
Cartman,"AAAAAHT!! 
"
Mysterion,"I could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime.  I have lived in South Park all my life. I decided it was up to me to keep this town safe.  Nobody at school knows my double life. To them, I'm just another fourth grader. But tonight, I am Mysterion. 
"
Sgt. Yates,"Oh, Mysterion, thank God you've come. What news do you have?
"
Mysterion,"There's some graffiti on the bridge again. I think those sixth grade kids are doing it. And the guy at the movie theater is harassing Mexicans again.
"
Officer 2,"We'll get right on it, Mysterion. Thank you. Thank you for all your help.  Godspeed, Mysterion!
"
Sgt. Yates,"You are a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak and dreary world! 
"
The Coon,"Dude, seriously? I'm gonna kick the shit out of you if you don't stop!
"
Mysterion,"This city needs my help. It cries for protection and I will-
"
"Mysterion, the Coon","Answer the call to save her.
"
The Coon,"That's what I'm supposed to say! I know it's you, Kyle. Just stop!
"
Mysterion,"I don't have time for this.  Fireworks are illegal in Colorado, you asshole!  Hey, he's got fireworks!
"
Cartman,"So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
"
Stan,"Not really.
"
Cartman,"Really?! Nobody was playing with any fireworks?! 
"
Stan,"Dude, what the hell?
"
Cartman,"Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!
"
Stan,"Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
"
Clyde,"Yeah, so do I.
"
Cartman,"What?! Why?
"
Clyde,"I don't know, it's just a cool costume.
"
Cartman,"It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
"
Wendy,"How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
"
Cartman,"Fucking bitch...
"
The Coon,"I had no choice.  I was at the end of my rope.  Sometimes when a superhero needs answers, he has to turn to the wretched underbelly of society.
"
A Voice,"Hahahahahahahahaaa... Look what the cat dragged in.
"
The Coon,"Come out where I can see you!
"
A Voice,"What's the matter, Coon? Nervous?
"
The Coon,"I didn't want to resort to this, but he could have the answers I need.
"
A Voice,"How utterly delightful! The heroic and mighty Coon  come to put a stop to me again.
"
The Coon,"Chaos. I need to keep on my toes.  I'm not here to stop you this time, Chaos! I need information.
"
Professor Chaos,"Oh I'm sure you do. But you see I  whoop.  But you see I also know you like to beat me up.
"
The Coon,"I didn't call you to fight, Chaos! I came to see if you know Mysterion's identity. 
"
Professor Chaos,"Oh I'm close. And I'll put an end to him, and all of you goody-two-shoe heroes!
"
The Coon,"I'm not on his side!
"
Professor Chaos,"Do you think I'm a fool?! All those times you stopped me from my acts of evil! All those times you tricked me into meeting you, and then ga- and then gave me titty-twisters! Not this time, Coon! I finally learned my lesson! Now, General Disarray!  Yeah-ha! 
"
The Coon,"That's it! 
"
Professor Chaos,"O- oh careful General Disarray.
"
The Coon,"Agh- Stop it! You, you... butthole! Knock it off!
"
Professor Chaos,"Hehyeah! We beat him, General Disarray! 
"
The Coon,"Listen to me! I want to... help you... get rid of Mysterion!
"
Professor Chaos,"Let him go, General Disarray!  Why would you help us?!
"
The Coon,"Because Mysterion is trying to  You fucker, that fuckin' hurt!  Because Mysterion is trying to say he's the hero this town needs! But that's my job!
"
Professor Chaos,"But you both fight for justice and good.
"
The Coon,"Yeah, but he's a fuckin' dick! I want him gone just as much as you do!
"
Professor Chaos,"Very well. I will show you what we know about Mysterion's identity, but if this is some kind of setup-
"
The Coon,"N- I'm the good guy, Chaos. I don't betray people.
"
Professor Chaos,"Weh- oh yeah. 
"
The Coon,"I didn't like having to work with this scumbag. But I knew Mysterion was out there, plotting his next move.
"
Mysterion,"Hello Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Whoa, what the?
"
Mysterion,"Do not be afraid. I mean you no harm.
"
Kyle,"Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
"
Mysterion,"Yes. But now I believe someone is trying to learn my true identity.
"
Kyle,"Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
"
Mysterion,"I cannot be unmasked, for then I would stop being a symbol. I need help. Somebody who can do background checks for me, do some investigating.
"
Kyle,"Who? Me? Why?
"
Mysterion,"Because I think you are the smartest kid in class. 
"
Professor Chaos,"This way! We will now show you our secret headquarters of DOOM.
"
The Coon,"You guys have your own storage facility?
"
Professor Chaos,"Actually it belongs to General Disarray's grandma, um but she lets us use it.  This is where we come up with all our evil plans. Here's our computer relays.  And this is like a, a cube of chaos that can destroy the world in one second!  And here's some of our evil minions!  We have everything we need here. Can I offer you a Coke or a Sprite or something?
"
The Coon,"I'll take a Sprite.
"
Professor Chaos,"Uhget the Coon a Sprite, General Disarray.  As you can see we too have been working hard on Mysterion's identity.
"
The Coon,"You have an entire wall dedicated to Mysterion? What about...? Do you, do you still have that ""Who Is The Coon?"" T-shirt I gave you?
"
Professor Chaos,"Oh yeah, I think it's around here somewhere. Uh, using our photos we are tryin' to pinpoint Mysterion's identity.
"
The Coon,"Why is Cartman crossed out? He, he could be Mysterion.
"
Professor Chaos,"No, he's too fat. Based on his body type it's gotta be someone like Stan or Kyle. 
"
The Coon,"Alright, al, alright, alright, look, Chaos. Just set up a video camera. I know how we can put an end to Mysterion once and for all.
"
Anchor,"The clock is ticking and the citizens of South Park are gripped in fear. Two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if Mysterion  does not reveal his identity.
"
Professor Chaos,"Mark my words, South Park! Your precious hero is now, uh, your undoing! If Mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by Wednesday night, I am going to blow up... a hospital. Blow up a hospital?  I'm not gonna blow up any hospital. Are you nuts? What?  Uh, the choice is yours, Mysterion! Unmask yourself or hundreds will die! Hahaha.  Jesus Christ.
"
Anchor,"Since the threat was issued there has been no sign of Mysterion. Where is Mysterion?
"
Anchor 2,"Where is Mysterion?
"
Professor Chaos,"Hey Coon w-we aren't actually gonna blo- blow up anything, are we?
"
The Coon,"If you don't make good on your threats, Chaos, then what good are your threats?
"
Professor Chaos,"But you really wanna blow up a hospital? I mean, a-aren't you a good guy?
"
The Coon,"Sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good, Chaos.
"
General Disarray,"You know, I've been thinking: if we're really evil villains, then we should betray him, and blow him up with the hospital.
"
The Coon,"You know, you're a little scrotum-licker dude! Why don't you shut the fuck up?!  Alright Chaos, I'm gonna get the triggers for these things at ACE Hardware. Keep an eye on this stuff! 
"
Professor Chaos,"Aww jeez General Disarray, this is a lot more than I ever really intended.  I mean, well I hate the world and all its beauty and happiness and all but, but blowin' up a hospital? It just seems mean.  Whoa. Oh hamburgers!
"
General Disarray,"AAAGH! 
"
Professor Chaos,"Aaah, a m m Mysterion, I b-, I beg you, I mean ah, judahadahada...
"
Mysterion,"Why are you doing this?! This isn't your usual MO, Chaos!
"
Professor Chaos,"Whowell I b- Well I b- ah I just would jes one nigh-, and then the Coon saw it up and I wa able to, and was able to 
"
Professor Chaos,"Waaugh!
"
Man 5,"What is that?
"
Man 6,"Look! Mysterion and Professor Chaos are fighting!
"
Man 7,"Give him hell, Mysterion! 
"
Woman 2,"Look out Mysterion! General Disarray is behind you! 
"
Officer 3,"Jesus Christ, we need backup out here! 
"
Officer 4,"I think I can get a shot at Chaos, sir.
"
Sgt. Yates,"You think your bullets can hurt him? 
"
Professor Chaos,"Yeah, we did it!
"
Man 8,"He's dead. Mysterion is dead.
"
Woman 3,"Nooo... 
"
Reporter,"The impossible has happened. Mysterion, beloved protector of the city, is dead. Who will save us now?
"
Man 9,"Wait! Look! 
"
Officer 4,"He's all right! 
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
"
The Coon,"Fear not everyone! Coon is here to save the day.
"
Man 10,"Isn't that Bruce Vilanch?
"
Man 11,"Be careful Bruce Vilanch! There are superhumans fighting right over there!
"
Professor Chaos,"Okay sorry sorry! I'm sorry! I give up! Please, I give up!
"
The Coon,"Don't worry, Mysterion!  The Coon will now help you!
"
Professor Chaos,"Well, wait! I thought we were workin' together.  Waaa.  Oh jeez, I think I broke a tooth. 
"
The Coon,"That was great teamwork, Mysterion. South Park is safe. Until next time.
"
Mysterion,"What next time?
"
The Coon,"Well, people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that they'll do anything. Won't be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask. 
"
Mysterion,"Citizens, tonight has shown me I have no choice but to unmask myself.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Don't do it, Mysterion! If you show your identity we'll be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante
"
The Coon,"Don't you think he knows that?! But superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good.
"
Man 12,"Don't show your face, Mysterion!
"
Man 13,"You have to be a symbol!
"
The Coon,"So that the next terrorist can threaten South Park if he doesn't unmask himself?!
"
Mysterion,"No, it's true. As long as my identity is a mystery, this will just happen again and again. It has to end. I will show my face. 
"
Crowd,"Ohhh.
"
Man 14,"Well I'll be.
"
The Coon,"I knew it was you! 'Member I even said it before!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Well I'm sorry but you're under arrest. Take the kid to jail. 
"
The Coon,"My entire plan worked to perfection.  My work here is done.  With Mysterion out of the way the Coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe.  Once again, I alone am the symbol this town can stand behind.  Every town needs a hero.  Every town needs... a Coon. 
"
Stan,"Do I really have to do this, Dad?
"
Randy,"Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
"
Stan,"But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
"
Teller,"Okay, next please.
"
Randy,"Go on, Stanley. 
"
Teller,"How can I help you, young man?
"
Stan,"I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
"
Teller,"Well that's fantastic, a really smart decision, young man. We can put that check in a Money Market Mutual Fund, then we'll reinvest the earnings into foreign currency accounts with compounding interest aaand it's gone. 
"
Stan,"Uh, what?
"
Teller,"It's gone. It's all gone.
"
Stan,"What's all gone?
"
Teller,"The money in your account - it didn't do too well, it's gone.
"
Stan,"What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
"
Teller,"Not anymore you don't. POOF.
"
Stan,"Well, what can I do to get back my money-?
"
Teller,"I'm sorry sir, but this line is for bank members only.
"
Stan,"I just opened an account.
"
Teller,"Do you have any money invested in this bank?
"
Stan,"No, you just lost it all!
"
Teller,"Then please stand aside for people who actually have money with us. Next please. 
"
Stan,"Hey!
"
Teller,"Hello Mrs. Farnicle, how are you today? Making a deposit are we? Great, we can just put that into your retirement account and make it go to work for you aaaaand it's gone.
"
Elderly Woman,"What?
"
Teller,"Sorry, yeah, that's gone. Please step aside for people who actually have money with the bank. Next please.
"
Stan,"Dad?!
"
Randy,"Hey I'm trying to teach my son the importance of savings. You already lost his money?
"
Teller,"Oh, Mr. Marsh, don't worry. We can just transfer money from your account into a portfolio with your son aaand it's gone! This line is for people who have money with the bank only please step aside. 
"
Announcer,"This, is a 9 News Special Report. RECESSION: A NATION IN PERIL
"
Anchor,"An economic crisis has hit South Park and the nation like never before. Another South Park bank has closed down, leaving thousands of people in debt.
"
Mr. Garrison,"It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.
"
Stephen,"It's really terrifying. We... we've got no money to pay our mortgage now. We could very easily lose our house!
"
Butters,"Hi, Grandma!
"
Darryl Weathers,"First the money started goin', and now everyone's gettin' laid off work! They took arrr jawbs!
"
Worker 1,"They took our jobs!
"
Worker 2,"Trk rrr jrrbs!
"
Worker 3,"Tuck rjrrbs.
"
Worker 4,"Turk rjrrrbs.
"
Anchor,"Just how far will the economy fall? We asked economic reporter Dan Banks for his assessment.  We'll have the rest of Dan's interview tonight at 10.
"
Sharon,"All right everyone, eat up. 
"
Randy,"Aw Jesus Christ! Sliced hot dogs and tomato slices?!
"
Sharon,"You said we had to be very careful with our money. I've got nothing for our food budget.
"
Stan,"Mom, Dad, how come there's suddenly no money?
"
Randy,"I'll tell you what happened, son! See, there's a bunch o' idiots out there who weren't happy with what they had!  They wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didn't even need.  People with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying.  And these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing,  'cause they thought money was endless!  It goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in America deserves to own a house. So we have people having a hard time paying their loans,  meaning less money coming in.  And the idiots couldn't see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the Economy. And they made the Economy very angry.  We're all feeling the Economy's vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money! Do you understand, son? 
"
Stan,"Yeah, I think I get it.
"
Orator 1,"And so why is our economy failing us? Because the government kept interest rates too low for too long! The government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price! How long will we sit and watch our economy just-? As the people we must...
"
Orator 2,"...An angel came to me and so I say to you: Do not listen to the Wall Street brokers! For they are the ones that put us in this situation! Fat cats with corporate greed! They are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom! Our responsibility is...
"
Cartman,"And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
"
Randy,"There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
"
Man 1,"He's right.
"
Man 2,"This is the first guy to actually make sense. 
"
Randy,"Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 
"
Clerk,"Hello young man, welcome to Sur la Tahbluh. Can I help you?
"
Stan,"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
"
Clerk,"Oh, that's all we get anymore, returns. Could you please just put the receipt here on this tahbluh.  Sorry, our computers are a little slow today. We need a new Ethernet cahbluh. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, I'd like to give you a refund but I'm afraid it's not doahbluh.
"
Stan,"What?
"
Clerk,"I said I'm not ahbluh, sir. You see, this Margaritaville was purchased with a payment plan?
"
Stan,"So?
"
Clerk,"Well an outside financing company handles those payment plans. Customers just pay for some of the machine and the finance company pays for the rest.
"
Stan,"Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
"
Clerk,"Hm... that's improbahbluh,  but not impossibluh. I'm not really sure how it works; you'll, you'll have to speak with the people at the top. I can give you the finance company's address if that... agreeahbluh with you. 
"
Randy,"We have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the Economy! There are those who will say that the Economy has forsaken us! Nay! You have forsaken the Economy!! And now you know the Economy's wrath! O thoust can shop at a sporting goods store, but knowest thou that the Economy will take away thy Broncos' cap from thine head!  Mock the Economy without fear! Thine own stockbrokers... now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the Economy! Well here we are, my friends! You have brought the Economy's vengeance upon yourselves!
"
Gerald,"What can we do, Randy?
"
Man 3,"Yes tell us.
"
Man 4,"Tell us.
"
Man 5,"Tell us what to do.
"
Man 6,"Tell us, Randy, what we should do!
"
Man 7,"What should we do, Randy?!
"
Randy,"We must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent! Instead of cars that take gasoline we can... get around on llamas from Drake's farm! Instead of video games that take batteries and software, our kids will play with squirrels! We must let the Economy know that we are capable of respecting it! No more needless spending!  The Economy is our shepherd. We shall not want. 
"
Al,"Mornin' Ted.
"
Ted,"Mornin' Al.
"
Kyle,"Well this sucks!
"
Clyde,"Sure was better when our parents were buyin' us stuff.
"
Cartman,"Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
"
Kyle,"You want something new every week, fatass.
"
Cartman,"Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
"
Kyle,"My fault?
"
Cartman,"The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
"
Kyle,"Don't even start! Don't even start, Cartman!
"
Butters,"Well,  why are we wearin' bedsheets and playing with squirrels, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
"
Butters,"Well Eric did. 
"
Cartman,"Just tell us where the cave is, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
"
Man 8,"We best speak with the Council, and tell them.. a young Jew is speaking heresy towards the Economy.
"
Receptionist,"Can I help you?
"
Stan,"I wanna return this Margaritaville.
"
Receptionist,"O-kay, let me send you into Josh. 
"
Josh,"Heeey, welcome to Big Orange Finance Company, yeah. Have a seat. You want some Carmex?
"
Stan,"No thanks. I wanna return this Margaritaville, and the guy at Sur la Table said that you were the company that financed it.
"
Josh,"Oh yeah no, you know what? No, yeah.
"
Stan,"What?
"
Josh,"Yeah, we can't give you your money back for that, yeah, no. You'd have to talk to the people on Wall Street, yeah, mmmm.
"
Stan,"Wall Street?
"
Josh,"Yeah, no, see, what I do is find Americans who want a frozen beverage machine but can't afford one, and I hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business, yeah.
"
Stan,"So?
"
Josh,"Yeah, so the problem is your Margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big Margaritaville security, yeah, no. Yeah. No. Yeah... 
"
Stephen,"The entire town has given over to your ways, Mr. Chairman. Everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills.
"
Father Maxi,"You've really done an amazing thing, Mr. Marsh. People have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the Economy's mighty sword.
"
Randy,"I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
"
Skeeter,"We've got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff. And, uh, Pat Sallsman is doin' house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online.
"
Randy,"Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
"
Man 9,"Council, I bring news of discord! A young Jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the Economy!
"
Randy,"What?!
"
Man 9,"He was saying that... your ideas are false and the Economy is not vengeful. He was rallying people to spend more!
"
Father Maxi,"Spend more?! What mockery is this?!
"
Randy,"Relax, Father Maxi. What harm can one Jew do against our... economic recovery movement?
"
Cartman,"I had a dream last night. I was in a field, and I had Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars right next to me. But then the sky went black and ...Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars just... melted in my hand. 
"
Kyle,"What's that? 
"
Man 10,"'Scuse me, we need to borrow your squirrels.
"
Kyle,"What? 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Now please, please! 
"
Man 10,"You have sinned!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.
"
Kyle,"What's going on?
"
Man 10,"Garrison, you have brought your filth to this town for the last time!
"
Kyle,"What did he do?
"
Man 11,"Your teacher was caught buying a KitchenAid Stand Mixer at Bed Bath & Beyond!
"
Man 10,"Take that punishment, heathen! 
"
Kyle,"Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
"
Man 10,"Move aside, kid! He must pay for his stand mixer.
"
Kyle,"Come on, this is ridiculous!
"
Man 10,"What's ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the Economy?!
"
Kyle,"Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Oh. 
"
Stan,"'Scuse me. 'Scuse me! I'd like to return this Margaritaville, please?
"
Stockbroker,"Margaritaville?
"
Stan,"My dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here.
"
Stockbroker,"Oh, that makes sense.
"
Stan,"It does?
"
Stockbroker,"You see, son, we lump thousands of these Margaritaville installment plans together into Margaritaville-based securities, then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks.
"
Stan,"So I can return it to a bank?
"
Stockbroker,"Nope, because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their Margaritavilles so the government had to buy the Margaritavilles assets from the banks.
"
Stan,"What?!
"
Stockbroker,"Just talk to the Treasury Department in DC. They're the ones who really understand how all this works.  Oh, sell sell sell sell sell sell sell!
"
Stan,"Aargh! 
"
Kyle,"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
"
Man 11,"By all reports, the young Jew is not letting up! He is still going around convincing people to have faith in the Economy by shopping!
"
Randy,"We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
"
Stephen,"Perhaps... he is the Economy's only Son, sent to save us.
"
Father Maxi,"Are you retarded, Stotch?! The Economy is omnipotent! Which means it can do anything! So saying it would be limited to one Son is fucking stupid!
"
Randy,"That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
"
Man 12,"Well then, there's only one option: we have to kill the Jew.
"
Father Maxi,"Yep, I think we gotta kill the Jew.
"
Skeeter,"I don't know... He's got a lot of support. It might be hard to even catch this Jew. 
"
Cartman,"Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
"
Treasurer 1,"Uhh, how can we help you, young man?
"
Stan,"I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
"
Treasurer 1,"Ohhh that makes sense.
"
Stan,"Nnnaaargh!
"
Treasurer 1,"No problem. We just need to consult the chart. We can determine your property's value and we'll be done.
"
Stan,"Really?  Thank you.
"
Treasurer 1,"Be right back. 
"
Treasurer 2,"Excellent news, sir. We've determined the investment value of your Margaritaville to be... ninety trillion dollars.
"
Stan,"What?!
"
Jimmy,"Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
"
Kyle,"I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
"
Butters,"Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
"
Kyle,"I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
"
Cartman,"All right, whoever is thinkin' of betraying Kyle, that is not cool!  That's freaking lame, dude! Kyle is trying to get the economy goin' again! If somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back, you're b-you're being a dick!  Go ahead, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
"
Jimmy,"Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
"
Kyle,"There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
"
Stan,"Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
"
Treasurer 1,"What, you think it's worth more?
"
Stan,"No, dude, that doesn't make sense!
"
Treasurer 2,"Well, you don't get ninety trillion dollars, but the chart says that's what it's worth.
"
Treasurer 3,"Uh oh, problem! Problem again!
"
Treasurer 2,"What is it now?
"
Treasurer 3,"Another insurance company is about to go under; if they do, people could lose millions!
"
Treasurer 1,"Okay, no problem.  We'd better consult the chart. 
"
Treasurer 3,"Sirs, another insurance company is going under!
"
Sir 1,"Now determining most prudent move for insurance company. 
"
Treasurer 1,"Bailout!
"
Treasurer 3,"Most prudent move is a bailout!
"
Sir 1,"Bail out the insurance company! 
"
Man 13,"It's a miracle.
"
Man 14,"Why would someone do this? 
"
Randy,"What is this? What's going on?
"
Stephen,"There! Look!  It's the Jew. Somehow he got a platinum AmEx with no spending limit.
"
Randy,"What's he doing?
"
Stephen,"He's... paying for everyone's debts. 
"
Darryl Weathers,"Hey thanks, kid, this is really nice of you.
"
Randy,"But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
"
Man 15,"So that people will have money to spend.
"
Sheila,"Kyle!  Kyle, you have to stop this! 
"
Kyle,"It's okay, Ma.
"
Sheila,"No-o Kyle, you'll be in debt for the rest of your life!  Please, somebody, get him to sto-o-op! 
"
Randy,"Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
"
Kyle,"Heunh. 
"
Man 16,"He paid for our debts so we could spend once more. 
"
Man 17,"He's dead.
"
Dr. Doctor,"No, he's just passed out. We should get him to bed. 
"
Anchor,"For the first time in almost a year, the economy in South Park has taken a small, but noticeable upturn.  Stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe... to make purchases. 
"
Randy,"Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! ""Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom."" Oh, we need this! 
"
Anchor,"Are we out of the woods yet? Only time will tell. But we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again. The person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice.  Barack Obama. 
"
Kyle,"Aww, come on!
"
Cartman,"Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
"
Wendy,"Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?
"
Stan,"What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!
"
Wendy,"What day?
"
Butters,"The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
"
Clyde,"They're gonna finally reveal who Phillip farted on to get out of jail.
"
Red,"Oh God, that show is so dumb.
"
Cartman,"Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
"
Tweek,"Eagh! This has been the longest week of my life!
"
Wendy,"Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
"
Cartman,"No! No, nono, you're right Bebe! Farts totally aren't funny. 
"
Little Girl,"Eww! 
"
Kyle,"Come on guys, we gotta go! 
"
Jimmy,"We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
"
Cartman,"Let's get to my house!! 
"
Wendy,"God they're so stupid!
"
Stan,"Oh boy!
"
Butters,"This is gonna be great!
"
Craig,"I've been waiting for this all week.
"
Butters,"Oh boy!
"
Cartman,"Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
"
Craig,"Dude, I was here first.
"
Cartman,"It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
"
Butters,"Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
"
Announcer,"You are watching the Canada Channel, the only channel in Canada.
"
Announcer 2,"Previously on Terrance & Phillip: Terrance farted on the American president, but Phillip took the heat. 
"
Phillip,"It wasn't me! 
"
Announcer 2,"And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Terrance & Phillip: Blood Rage 
"
Announcer,"...will not be seen tonight, so that we may bring you this Queef Sisters Special!
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Announcer 3,"The Canada Channel presents... The Queef Sisters. Katherine and Katie Queef.  Two Toronto girls who love shooting air out their vaginas.  It's The Queef Sisters special on Channel Canada.
"
Doctor,"Alright Queef Sisters, it's time for your yearly PAP smear and vag exam.
"
Katie,"Alright Doctor.
"
Katherine,"I'm ready, Doctor.
"
Doctor,"Now I'm just going to check for cysts.  Awww! 
"
Cartman,"What the fuck is this?!
"
Doctor,"Now listen heauh! If you queef in my face, then I refuse to be your gynecologist!
"
Katherine,"I'm sorry, doctor. I had air trapped in my vagina.
"
Katie,"Huhuhuhu!
"
Doctor,"Well just don't let it happen again! Now I'm going to check for cysts.  Arh!  Now stop it! That isn't funny! Babies come from there!  That's it! No PAP smear for you!
"
Katherine,"But doctor, what if I have cancer?
"
Doctor,"You should have thought of that before you queefed in my face three times! 
"
Butters,"They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
"
Katie,"Doctor, my sister is just being difficult. Maybe you can just examine my cervix instead.
"
Doctor,"Well alright, let me check for cysts.  Nooo!  That does it, Queef Sisters! I'm not your vaginal doctor anymore! 
"
Katherine,"Oh Katie, I do believe we made the doctor angry.
"
Katie,"I guess so Katherine.
"
Cartman,"Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
"
Phillip,"What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
"
Terrance,"Queef Sisters?!
"
Network President,"That's right. It's a hot new Canadian show we're trying out.
"
Terrance,"You replaced our show with this?! But they aren't funny! All they do is queef all the time!
"
Phillip,"That's sick!
"
Network President,"You think farts are funny; why not queefs?
"
Terrance,"Because babies come from there!
"
Network President,"Eh, look guys, women are starting to be the driving force behind the television audience! You know, women empowerment and the get-go. So we want to try to appeal to the female sensibility. Sorry guys, but if you ask me, your farts have gotten stale!
"
Cartman,"No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
"
Wendy,"What's going on?
"
Stan,"We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
"
Cartman,"You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
"
Clyde,"I threw up on my way home.
"
Cartman,"Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 
"
Stan,"You tell 'em, Cartman!
"
Red,"What happened?
"
Butters,"They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
"
Kyle,"It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
"
Bebe,"Oh what? So farts are hysterical but queefs are gross?
"
Cartman,"You know that little kids could have been watching that?! What kind of network are you running there in Canada?! Don't call me buddy! I'm not your buddy! 
"
Bebe,"I can't believe they're this upset.
"
Red,"God, they're annoying!
"
Annie,"I don't even know what a queef is.
"
Wendy,"It's when a woman blows air out her vag, Annie.
"
Annie,"Oh.
"
Red,"You know that girl Samantha Dunskin, she can make herself queef whenever she wants.
"
Bebe,"Really?
"
Wendy,"Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
"
Cartman,"And to that end, by resorting to filth and garbage, the Canada Channel has thusly...
"
Kyle,"Robbed us of our innocence.
"
Cartman,"Yes, that's good.
"
Butters,"Robbed us of our innocence... 
"
Wendy,"Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.
"
Stan,"What? 
"
Butters,"Oh God, oh my God no! 
"
Stephen,"Butters?
"
Randy,"Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 
"
Sharon,"Why? What happened?
"
Randy,"A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 
"
Sharon,"...So?
"
Randy,"Hey pal. I heard about what happened at school today. You wanna talk about it?
"
Stan,"Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
"
Randy,"I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
"
Stan,"It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
"
Randy,"Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face. 
"
Gerald,"How did this happen?
"
Stuart,"Where were the teachers?!
"
Mrs. Testaburger,"Whoa, whoa whoa, wait a minute. Are you saying we're all here just because a girl queefed on a boy?
"
Man,"Just?!
"
Thomas,"We're here to find out why?!
"
Randy,"The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Now hold on a minute, I think we're being a little drastic here. You know, I probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl. 
"
Randy,"What does that have to do with anything? 
"
Regis,"Our next guests have really taken America by storm. Their hit show is being tuned in by women all over the world. Please welcome the Queef Sisters! 
"
Katherine,"Oh hello Regis.
"
Katie,"Hello Kelly. 
"
Regis,"So, uh, gals, ...you seem to really like queefing.
"
Katherine,"Well Reeg, it's like this: we think that queefing is a perfectly normal female bodily function. Why not have fun with it? 
"
Regis,"But I mean really, isn't queefing a bit juvenile?
"
Katie,"Men enjoy farts, so why shouldn't women enjoy their queefs?
"
Katherine,"That's right. We've written all about it in our new feminist book, Eat, Pray, Queef.
"
Kelly,"Well I think that what you gals are doing for the feminist movement is amazing. And that's why women all over America stand behind you. 
"
Regis,"D'ohhh! 
"
Network President,"Terrance and Phillip, you've put on a terrific show for many many years. You've made Canada Channel what it is today. You're fired.
"
Terrance & Phillip,"Fired?!
"
Network President,"Sorry guys, but this queefing thing is really catching on.  Queef Sisters' ratings are through the roof, and to pay them what they're asking we've gotta get rid of you. Goodbye. Here's some cookies. 
"
Terrance,"Brian, don't do this!
"
Phillip,"You can't let Canada Channel be soiled by that perverse garbage! You know it's sick!
"
Brian,"Yes, I know it's sick. To be honest, I gag every time one of them lets out a queef.  But it's money Goddammit and this channel needs it! I'm sorry, Terrance & Phillip, your show is done!
"
Martha,"I always love when Spring is on the way. Such a fun and inspiring time to decorate. Just like most women out there I've really gotten into queefing lately.  It's a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays. What we're gonna do is just... cut out some paper... like... this...  and cut out little stars and little moon shapes,  and we're gonna just... jam those... up... and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores; they come in... little tube which make them very easy to just...  shoot... right up the ol'... there we are.. And of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive Easter grass. But the point is that when we're done we can... let one rip.  See how pretty that was? It's a good thing.
"
Randy,"What was that?
"
Sharon,"Oh, excuse me, I...  I, I had a little air trapped. 
"
Randy,"Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
"
Sharon,"Pardon me. 
"
Stan,"Mom, gross! 
"
Randy,"Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
"
Sharon,"Sorry, it's just ...it's kind of funny how much it bothers you.
"
Randy,"Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!
"
Stan,"Stop it, Mom!
"
Randy,"Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
"
Sharon,"Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
"
Randy,"Sharon! Marsh!
"
Sharon,"Ex-cuse me.
"
Shelly,"Hey Mom, do you like Australia? 'Cause that was the Great Barrier Queef. 
"
Randy,"That's it, I'm leaving! 
"
Stan,"I'm going too. 
"
Sharon,"Oh! Oh please, Randy! How many times have you farted in bed and held my head under the covers?!
"
Randy,"That's completely different!
"
Stan,"Yeah it's different, Mom!
"
Sharon,"Alright, tell me exactly where the line is. Er, okay, how about this? I have a friend Abbie. She had a baby boy and it farted.
"
Randy,"Heh, yeah?
"
Sharon,"But she was actually still pregnant with the baby boy and it farted inside her.
"
Randy,"Yeah?
"
Sharon,"And then the gas from the baby's fart traveled down and shot out her vagina, haHA. 
"
Randy,"Come on Stanley, let's go. 
"
Sharon,"Oh! Oh, so when does that stop being funny?!
"
Randy,"It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 
"
Katie,"Look Katherine, I made queef cookies!
"
Katherine,"But those are just ginger snaps, Katie.  Could you get that, Katie? 
"
Katie,"Oh my God! Look, Katherine! It's Canadian television stars Terrance & Phillip!
"
Katherine,"Oh my God, they're famous!  Well hello sirs! It is such an honor to meet you! Oh Katie, I'm getting all goosebumpy and queefy. 
"
Katie,"Wooo.
"
Phillip,"May we come in, please?
"
Katherine,"Oh certainly, though I feel we look a mess. 
"
Terrance,"Very nice place you have here. Network must be paying you well.
"
Katie,"Oho yes, the show is going aboat as well as it could. 
"
Terrance,"All right, enough with the queefing! We didn't come for a social call!
"
Phillip,"That's right! We've come to kill you! 
"
Katie,"Why kill us? We love you.
"
Terrance,"Because you've reduced Canada Channel to smut and toilet humor!
"
Katherine,"Oh. Well I suppose if we're going to die, we should die by the hands of our idols.
"
Terrance,"Your idols?
"
Katherine,"We grew up watching you. You meant the world to us. We used to fantasize about pleasing you in all different ways. Know that it is an honor to die by your hand. 
"
Terrance,"I don't think I can do it, Phillip. 
"
Phillip,"Why not? 
"
Terrance,"Because I'm suddenly finding myself strangely attracted to Katherine.
"
Phillip,"What?! That's crazy, Terrance! Katie is obviously the hot one. 
"
Butters,"Ohhhhh ohhhhh. 
"
Cartman,"Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
"
Butters,"Oh. Hey fellas.
"
Cartman,"We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
"
Butters,"Aw thanks.
"
Stan,"Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
"
Butters,"Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
"
Kyle,"Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
"
Butters,"My, my picture?
"
Cartman,"You're going to be the face of queef abuse, Butters, so that we can make people open their eyes.
"
Terrance,"AAH! 
"
Phillip,"Dammit I'm trying to enjoy my wine, Katie!
"
Terrance,"No, that was me, Phillip. I farted.
"
Phillip,"Oh. 
"
Katherine,"Oh, this is a dream come true. I've always wanted to meet you, Phillip. 
"
Terrance,"Phillip?! I'm Terrance!
"
Katie,"What? I thought you were Terrance.
"
Phillip,"No, I'm Phillip!
"
Katherine,"Oh dear. 
"
Stephen,"A disgusting, violating trend is taking over our city, our state, our nation. Queefing has become an acceptable evil.
"
Cartman,"Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.
"
Stan,"On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
"
Randy,"I would like to take this opportunity to explain why farts are funny and queefs are not. Men have always joked about farts and we in fact name our farts. We have The Squeaker  And then there's The Foghorn  and the ""Don't be scared""  and of course there's the-
"
Woman,"Excuse me.  Well if that really is your argument, it isn't a very sound one. Women name their queefs too.
"
Other Women,"That's right! We do.
"
Woman,"For instance, we have the Sneezing Unicorn.  and The Resuscitator 
"
Cartman,"Sick! Stop it, lady!
"
Randy,"Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 
"
Woman 2,"That's all well and good, but we can do the Road Warrior. 
"
Road Warrior Queef,"Nooo! We go iiin! We kiiill! No more talk! We kiiill! Soon, my dog of war, but we have to do it my way.  Losers! Losers wait!
"
Males,"AWWW!
"
Randy,"Jesus Christ!
"
Phillip,"You stupid bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?! 
"
Katherine,"I'm not your sex toy, you fucking pig! 
"
Phillip,"Ugh! You don't queef in bed while we're having sex!
"
Katherine,"Fuck you, you don't fucking slap me! 
"
Terrance,"Could you please keep it down? We're trying to have sex over here.
"
Phillip,"She queefed while we were having sex, Terrance!
"
Terrance,"SICK!
"
Katie,"Well what's the big deal? I've been queefing in this bed the entire time.
"
Terrance,"What?! Gross! 
"
Katie,"How dare you?! 
"
Katherine,"Get out! Get out both of you!  We never want to see you again! 
"
Terrance,"After everything we've been through? 
"
Terrance,"What the hell am I going to do, Phillip? She makes me so mad sometimes.
"
Phillip,"Katherine just won't stop queefing, but I don't know if I can live without her.
"
Terrance,"Katie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.
"
Phillip,"Me too, Katherine. I don't love your queefs, but dammit, I love you.
"
Katie,"Oh Terrance. 
"
Katherine,"Phillip! 
"
Randy,"Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
"
Stan,"No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!
"
Randy,"Alright son! Yeah!!
"
Sharon,"What's going on?
"
Randy,"HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
"
Sharon,"Well, ...congratulations, guys. Looks like you got us. Good job.
"
Randy,"Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...
"
Sharon,"You really think women cared that much about queefing? Is that really what you think this has all been about? This has been about women having a little bit of fun for once at your expense. For just this one time we could be the immature ones to make you feel uncomfortable. But no, you just couldn't let us have that one little thing, could you? Because even though things are getting better for women, you still think of us as lesser people sometimes, and we always have to prove ourselves twice as hard. Congratulations, guys.  For getting your way... again. 
"
Stan,"Mom, we didn't mean... 
"
Randy,"Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 
"
Stan,"Yeah. We all got so caught up in how we felt that we didn't realize... women actually cared about something a lot deeper.
"
Randy,"Stan, let's call the guys together. Maybe we can make this right.
"
Randy,"There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
"
"Randy, Stan","And realize we've been keeping women down.
"
Mr. Mackey,"They have power and they have courage.
"
"Stephen, Butters","And we must all stand by the belief,
"
"Gerald, Kyle","That a woman is strong, and she has the right to queef.
"
The Males,"Fly free. Free to queef aloud; fly free. Let every queef show that you’re proud.
"
Randy,"You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
"
The Males,"You are woman now, and you are free to queef.
"
Cartman,"It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
"
Mr. Garrison,"They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
"
The Males (Randy),"Queef free (Queef free). Every woman has the right; queef free (Queef free). Let your queefing stars shine bright.You are woman, hear you roar (queef free), queefing too loud to ignore. Queef a little each day and let your soul take flight!
Ah-aaaaaaah-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, queef free.
"
Bishop,"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.  Nooo! 
"
Phillip,"Stop it, Katherine! This is a serious moment!
"
Bishop,"Therefore what God has joined together let no man- 
"
Phillip,"Aww. sick! 
"
Bishop,"That's it! I now pronounce you farts and queefs! 
"
Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? 
"
Jimmy,"Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine.
"
Cartman,"Yeah well, ya wanna do somethin'? I wanted to hang out with Stan and Kyle, but they're all pissed off at me for somethin' so I have to hang out with you.
"
Jimmy,"Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
"
Cartman,"Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
"
Jimmy,"Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
"
Cartman,"No, that's not that funny. Let's try something else.
"
Jimmy,"Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
"
Cartman,"No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 
"
Jimmy,"...So the Pope says, ""What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?""
"
Cartman,"Meh. 
"
Sarah,"Here's some fruit, boys.  Better for you than potato chips. Oh Jimmy, look out, there's a black widow! 
"
Jimmy,"Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.
"
Cartman,"Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
"
Jimmy,"You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. 
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I like fishsticks.

Jimmy,"Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks.  Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before?

Butters,"Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
"
Jimmy,"Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.
"
Cartman,"Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
"
Clyde,"Hey.
"
Stan,"What's going on?
"
Butters,"Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
"
Cartman,"Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
"
Clyde,"Yes. 
"
Cartman,"Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
"
Clyde,"Yes. 
"
Cartman,"What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
"
Butters,"HA you saiid you like fishsticks in your mouth; that makes you a gay fish! 
"
Cartman,"Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?
"
Token,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I guess so. 
"
Cartman,"Shh shh shh shh Butters Butters.  You you like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
"
Token,"Yes.
"
Cartman,"What are you?

"Butters, Cartman","A gay fish? 
"
Butters,"Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?
"
Stephen,"Oh hey Peterson, buying fishsticks, I see.
"
Peterson,"Yeah, I like fishsticks.
"
Stephen,"What are you, Peterson? A gay fish? 
"
Announcer,"And now, here he is! Jimmy Kimmel! 
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Alright, hey, how are we all feelin' tonight?  So uhhh, let me ask the guys in the audience a question. Do you like fishsticks?
"
The Guys,"Yes.
"
Jimmy Kimmel,"Huh. What are you, gay fish? 
"
David Letterman,"And so uhhh, hay Paul, do you like fishsticks, Paul?
"
Paul Shaffer,"Uhhh, sure?
"
David Letterman,"What are you, Paul, a gay fish? 
"
Jay Leno,"So apparently more and more Americans are eating fishsticks. Have you seen this? Have you read about this? Loving fishsticks, kinda makes me wonder, you know? What is everybody, a gay fish? 
"
Tom Snyder,"It is quite possibly the funniest joke over conceived, and its origin is unknown. The fishsticks joke crosses all border, all races, all ages and ethnic groups and is slowly uniting our country. In fact, the only person who appears to not get the joke is rapper Kanye West, who becomes furious when people use the joke on him.
"
Kanye,"Yo, that is messed up, yo! I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain't no fish! Alright?!
"
Tom Snyder,"You. Really. Don't. Get it.
"
Kanye,"Hey man, I'm a genius, alright?! I'm the most talented musician in the world! If I was a homosexual, or a fish, I would know!
"
Tom Snyder,"You're a rapper.
"
Kanye,"Yes.
"
Tom Snyder,"An entrepreneur.
"
Kanye,"Yes.
"
Tom Snyder,"And you like fishsdicks.
"
Kanye,"Yes.
"
Tom Snyder,"You're a gay fish.
"
Kanye,"No! I am not no gay fish!
"
Tom Snyder,"Just gay?
"
Kanye,"I'm not gay and I'm not a fish! Man!
"
Tom Snyder,"You are male?
"
Kanye,"Damn right I'm male.
"
Tom Snyder,"A male that like fish dicks.
"
Kanye,"Yeah, I like fishsticks
"
Tom Snyder,"You like to put fish dicks in your mouth.
"
Kanye,"Yeah.
"
Tom Snyder,"You're a gay fish.
"
Kanye,"Alright, that does it! I'm gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass! 
"
Cartman,"And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
"
Kyle,"We know, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
"
Jimmy,"P-patent?
"
Cartman,"Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
"
Jimmy,"Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
"
Cartman,"Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 
"
Kyle,"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
"
Jimmy,"Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
"
Kyle,"Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.
"
Jimmy,"Actually it was potato chips.
"
Kyle,"I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
"
Jimmy,"W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.
"
Craig,"Then just give him half.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Craig,"I like you Jimmy, but you're not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he's only asking for half.
"
Kyle,"Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
"
Craig,"Yep. And if I had wheels, I'd be a wagon.
"
Kyle,"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!""
"
Craig,"Just give him half.
"
Kanye,"There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I'm going to prove once and for all: I'm not a fish. Because I am a genius, I've ascertained that fish have gills.  Doctor, do I have gills?
"
Doctor,"He does not have gills.
"
Kanye,"You hear that? No gills! So I can't be a fish. And I'm a genius voice of a generation so I'm not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It's over! Now are there any questions?
"
Reporter 1,"Do you like fishsticks?
"
Kanye,"Love 'em!
"
Reporter 2,"You're a gay fish. 
"
Kanye,"No I'm not- AAAARGH! 
"
Conan O'Brien,"Alright, recently... Recently we've all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here's your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia.
"
Carlos Mencia,"Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!
"
Conan O'Brien,"So Carlos, you've got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?
"
Carlos Mencia,"Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas 'cause I'm so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, """"Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks?"" And my homeboy says ""Yeah Carlos"" you know, ""you're so funny!"" And then it just occurred to me. I said, ""Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!""  And this is how I came up with it, my amigos! 
"
Cartman,"Motherfucker!
"
Cartman,"Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
"
Jimmy,"Really?
"
Cartman,"Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
"
Jimmy,"Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
"
Cartman,"But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn't do!
"
Jimmy,"Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
"
Cartman,"What?!
"
Jimmy,"Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
"
Cartman,"Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
"
Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
"
Jimmy,"Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
"
Cartman,"Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
"
Sarah,"Here's some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.
"
Cartman,"Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 
"
Jimmy,"Wow, thanks Eric.
"
Jimmy,"Is that... Is that how it happened?
"
Cartman,"Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
"
Jimmy,"I'm... I'm sorry?
"
Cartman,"It's cool man, it's cool. 
"
Announcer,"Here he is, y'all! Give it up for Kanye West!
"
Kanye,"Yo. Ungh. Yo.  Yo, whoa! Whoa, what the hell?! 
"
Audience,"Gay fish! Gay fish! Gay fish!
"
Kanye,"Yo, fuck this noise, yo! 
"
Kanye,"Just doesn't make any sense, yo. Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?
"
House,"Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don't get it, you don't get it.
"
Kanye,"What do you mean, I don't get it, House?! I'm a genius. I'll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let's see...  Somethin' about fishsticks... interacting with me... makes me gay fish.
"
Aide 1,"Kanye, really...
"
Kanye,"Shut up!  Alright, now what do we know about fishsticks?  They're breaded, they're fried, they're frozen. Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim.  Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?
"
House,"No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don't, don't you get it? You see, fish dicks is a is a play on words.
"
Kanye,"I don't need anyone tellin' me ""play on words""! I'm a motherfuckin' lyrical wordsmith motherfuckin' genius!
"
Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I talk to you for a second?
"
Kyle,"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
"
Cartman,"It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
"
Kyle,"You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
"
Cartman,"You do?
"
Kyle,"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
"
Cartman,"But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
"
Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
"
Jimmy,"Oh hey Eric. Just workin' on some jokes.
"
Cartman,"That's cool. You wanna write some together? 
"
Jimmy,"That'd be great! I've always wanted to work with you. You're really funny and you're totally not fat.
"
Cartman,"Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks
"
Jimmy,"Hey, you're really onto something there.
"
Sarah,"Hello Eric. Have some chips, because you're totally not fat at all.
"
Cartman,"Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?""
"
Jimmy,"Right. And then I say, ""Yeah.""
"
Cartman,"So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?""
"
Jimmy,"Oh wow, this is incredible! 
"
Sarah,"What is that?
"
Cartman,"It's a dragon of some kind! Don't worry, I can save you all! 
"
Butters,"Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.
"
Clyde,"He's the most awesome kid in school!
"
Wendy,"And he's not fat at all.
"
Cartman,"Thanks you guys!
"
Cartman,"Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
"
Kanye,"Is it perhaps that I'm fashionable, and fishsticks are crunchy?
"
Aide 2,"Yo Kanye, KANYE! We found him money.
"
Kanye,"Found who?
"
Aide 2,"You told us to track down whoever started the whole fishstick thang. We found out who, dawg.
"
Carlos Mencia,"Come on, maaaan. What is this, maaaan? What the fuck is goin' on maaaan?  Oh fuck maaaan, Kanye Wehhst? Noo shiiit maaan, okay look it wasn't me. I didn't really start the fishstick thing, alriight?
"
Kanye,"You're just sayin' that now 'cause you're scared.
"
Mencia,"No man it's truuue. I stole it maaan. I took credit for it 'cause I'm not actually funneee. Come on, maaan, do you know what it's like? Being a comedian but not being funneee? Come on, Kanye, I just take jokes and repackage them with a Mexican accent, maaan.
"
Kanye,"Think you can make fun of me? I'm a genius! I'm the voice of a generation! What are you?!
"
Mencia,"Nothing! Look at me maaan. I'm not funny, I steal jokes, my dick don't work maaan. I got to piss in a plastic bag, man, I got no dick.
"
Kanye,"I ain't gonna hurt you. I pay people to do that for me.
"
Mencia,"Awww shih oh no man, come on, I got no dick, man! 
"
Kanye,"Now, explain it to me. Why do people think I'm a gay fish?
"
Mencia,"'Cause... 'cause you like fish dicks, man. Come on, maaan. Don't you get it? Please, just get it, maaan.
"
Kanye,"Why- Look at me, look at me!  I love fishsticks. I love putting fishsticks in my mouth. 
"
Mencia,"You're a- ...you're a gay fish, maaan. 
"
Ellen DeGeneres,"Thank you, thank you very much. Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke. And ever since then us comedians have been kicking ourselves for not thinking of it.  But today we have with us the true creators of the fishsticks joke. Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer.  Hey guys!
"
Cartman,"Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
"
Ellen,"So guys, I gotta ask: how did you come up with this incredible joke?
"
Jimmy,"It was just a-
"
Cartman,"Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
"
Ellen,"But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?
"
Jimmy,"Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-
"
Cartman,"Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 
"
Ellen,"That's so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?
"
Jimmy,"Yes Ma'am. 
"
Cartman,"Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
"
Ellen,"I see. And did you know that Carlos Mencia was found dead in his house this morning with fishsticks stuffed down his open neck hole? 
"
Cartman,"Uhhh excuse me? 
"
Kanye,"Get my jet ready. Looks like we got another inning to play. 
"
Cartman,"Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
"
Jimmy,"It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, that was kewl huh?
"
Jimmy,"Eric, there's something I really need to know.
"
Cartman,"Whassat?
"
Jimmy,"How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
"
Cartman,"So... here it is.
"
Jimmy,"How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
"
Cartman,"That is bullcrap Jimmy, and you know it! I had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did!  Dude, it's Puff Daddy!
"
Kanye,"Tie up these motherfuckers!  Now I'm gonna ask you motherfuckers one more time: why did you start these rumors about me?!
"
Jimmy,"Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.
"
Kanye,"Aw right. Everyone knows who I am! I wanna know how this got started!
"
Jimmy,"Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
"
Cartman,"Oh, so now it's we, huh Jimmy? A minute ago you said you did it all yourself!
"
Jimmy,"Well I just but I buh I was, gonna ebeh-
"
Cartman,"Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
"
Cartman,"Hello Jim.
"
Jimmy,"Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!
"
Cartman,"What are you up to?
"
Jimmy,"I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
"
Cartman,"Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. 
"
Jimmy,"Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. 
"
Cartman,"Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
"
Sarah,"Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.
"
Cartman,"Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" 
"
Jimmy,"What was that? 
"
Butters,"Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 
"
Wendy,"You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! 
"
Jimmy,"Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
"
Cartman,"Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.
"
Jimmy,"What?!
"
Cartman,"You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
"
Jimmy,"Jesus Eric, he's gonna kill you! You won't even admit it was just me, knowing you're gonna die?
"
Cartman,"Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
"
Jimmy,"What? I, I still don't get anything.
"
Cartman,"All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
"
Jimmy,"Rih, r-r-really?
"
Cartman,"I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can't accept the truth of who they are.  Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can't help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won't let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.
"
Jimmy,"Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.
"
Kanye,"He's right. For so long I've considered myself God's gift to the world that I couldn't take it when people made fun of me. But they weren't makin' fun of me. They were tryin' to help me.  Boys I understand what you did now.  Untie them guys. I know what I have to do.
"
Aide 2,"Yo Kanye! You sure about this?
"
Kanye,"It's time for me to stop runnin'. I need to believe what people tell me.  Let all my fans know I love 'em, but a gay fish just can't live in the outside world forever. Don't be sad for me guys!  I'm goin' home! 
"
Kanye,"(Uh. Come on.)
I've been so lonely, girl, I've been so sad and down.
Couldn't understand why haters joked around
I wanted to be free with other creatures like me
And now I got my wish...
'Cuz I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (it's alright, girl)
Makin' love to other gay fish gay fish (Unh)
All those lonely nights at the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle feeling like a whore
'Cuz I wasn't being true even though everyone said
That I had to make a switch (dead fish)...
Now I know that I'm a gay fish gay fish (Gay fish, yo)
Motherfuckin' gay fish gay fish (I'm a, I'm a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish gay fish (Yes, now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish.

Randy,"Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 
"
Sharon,"Hey guys, it's almost 2 a.m.
"
Randy,"We know!
"
Sharon,"Well it's way past time for bed.
"
Randy,"Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
"
Sharon,"Well it's just a block of wood and some wheels; I don't think there's that much more you can do with it.
"
Randy,"That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 
"
Stan,"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
"
Randy,"Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.
"
Stan,"What is that?
"
Randy,"It's, uh it's nothing, really.
"
Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the Hadron particle super-collider in Switzerland, where authorities are shocked and baffled over the theft of a superconducting bending magnet created for use in tests with particle acceleration.
"
Stan,"Oh no, he didn't.
"
Reporter,"The superconducting magnet was stolen sometime last week. Surveillance cameras were able to record the theft on tape and police are now looking for  Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan. Caught here in these photos, the troubled rebel princess is seen taking the superconducting magnet and then appearing disoriented as she tries to find her way out.  If you have any information of Princess Leia's whereabouts, please call your local police department.
"
Judge,"Alright Scouts and Dads, the racing continues. And it looks like our next heat is ready to go, in 3, 2, 1, race!  Two point one seconds for Tommy Bretts. Looks like we have a new leader, folks.
"
Tommy and His Dad,"All right!
"
Randy,"Alright Stan, we're gonna need to check in and have our car inspected to qualify.  Now, son, Daddy needs to teach you something very important about ""tells.""
"
Stan,"Tells?
"
Randy,"When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
"
Stan,"Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
"
Randy,"Son. ...You have to learn how to lie correctly someday, might as well be today, alright? I love you, son. 
"
Official,"Looks good. Thank you and good luck today.  Alright, next please.  Name?
"
Stan,"It's uh, Marsh. 
"
Official,"Alright, car weighs in at 15 ounces. Do you hearby swear that you used parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit and only parts in the official Pinewood Derby kit?
"
Randy,"Yes I do, yes I do.
"
Stan,"Yes I do.
"
Official,"Alright you man, good luck today.

Mr. Hollis,"Well well, look son, it's the Marshes.

Randy,"Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
"
Mr. Hollis,"No, little Emmett hasn't gone yet. Think they're saving the best for last.  Clocked her in at home at 1.5 seconds. It's the fastest car we've ever built.
"
Randy,"One point five?
"
Judge,"The time to beat is 1.9 seconds. May we please have... Brewster, Marsh, Jarvis, and Hollis. 
"
Mr. Hollis,"Huh, only fitting our boys should be going head to head for their match, hey Marsh? Heh. 
"
Randy,"Come on, Stan, you can do this! 
"
Judge,"Alright, kids, are you ready? Here we go, last race for the state championship in 3, 2, 1, Go!

Announcer,"This is Nine News at Ten.
"
Anchorman,"A Colorado boy and his father have set a new record at the Pinewood Derby.  Stan and Randy Marsh not only broke a speed record, but actually appear to have bent time and space and discovered warp speed.  A parade was held for the winners earlier today , and already offers for commercials and endorsement deals for the father and son appear to be pouring in. 
"
Emmett,"Dad, I just want you to know I still love you.  Waaaagh!  He's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK, he's OK-
"
Agent Clark,"Stan Marsh?
"
Stan,"Yeah?
"
Agent Clark,"I'm Agent Clark  and this is Agent Marx  We'd like to talk to you about your Pinewood Derby car.
"
Stan,"Aw crap, Dad! 
"
Agent Clark,"Young man, what we are about to tell you is a matter of national security. Yesterday every country and embassy on Earth was contacted by... an alien life force.
"
Stan,"Alien?
"
Agent Marx,"Apparently the alien came across your Pinewood Derby car and is now headed to our planet.
"
Stan,"What does it want?
"
Agent Clark,"We believe that they intend to welcome us into the Galactic Federation of Planets. They will want to meet the people who discovered warp speed for our species.
"
Randy,"Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
"
Stan,"Dad they aren't here for that.
"
Randy,"Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.
"
Agent Clark,"Mr. Marsh, we were just telling your son that thanks to you, we have made first contact with alien life.
"
Randy,"What?  Hey, hey Sharon.
"
Agent Marx,"NASA's confirmed that an alien ship has entered our solar system and it is headed here,
"
Randy,"So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
"
Sharon,"What? Oh my God.
"
Randy,"Yeah, but I guess it's just a dumb little race like you said, huh Sharon?
"
Reporter,"The world holds its breath as an alien ship prepares to land. Now that our planet has achieved warp speed, we're about to be welcomed into the universal society. All thanks to a father and son who broke the warp barrier using only the parts in this  Pinewood Derby car kit.
"
General,"Mr. Marsh, you are on with all the world leaders. 
"
Randy,"Hullo?
"
Britain,"Godspeed, Mr.Marsh.
"
France,"Ze nation of France iz with you.
"
Japan,"Good ruck witha 'harien, Mista Marsh.
"
China,"Prease say herro froma China.
"
Randy,"Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 
"
Reporter,"Our first encounter with extraterrestrial life is about to happen. Will it be like in Star Trek: First Contact? Or will it be more like Contact, with Jody Foster? 
"
Alien,"I seek the life forms that made this. 
"
Randy,"That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
"
Alien,"Oh yeah?  You're gonna build me another one, see?
"
Randy,"He's got a gun!
"
Alien,"Everyone down on the ground!  Get those hands up! Let me see those hands! Do it now! I mean it! Show me those hands! I'm Baby Fark McGee-zax, the greatest gangster this universe has ever seen, right?!
"
Townsman,"You can't threaten us!  Ow!
"
McGee-zax,"Who wants it next, huh?!  Anyone else on this planet wanna be a hero? 
"
Randy,"What do you want?
"
McGee-zax,"I'm on the lam. Got the entire Federation of Planets after me. But they ain't gonna catch me, ya got that?! They might have busted my warp drive, but you obviously know how to make 'em! 
"
New Yorker,"Screw this guy! He can't take out all of us!  Aargh!
"
McGee-zax,"I can kill any mug on this two-bit planet I want!  You build me a new warp drive or you're all gonna get it, see?!
"
Judge,"Fine. He can build you what you want. All he needs is the official Pinewood Derby kit. Right Marsh?
"
Randy,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's all we need, huh Stan?  Oh boy.
"
Randy,"Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
"
McGee-zax,"What's takin' so long?! You're stallin'!
"
Stephen,"Come on Randy, just build him the warp drive and he'll leave us alone.
"
Randy,"We're working on it! 
"
Stan,"Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
"
Randy,"Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.
"
Stan,"Well we have to tell them we used something outside the kit.
"
Randy,"Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
"
McGee-zax,"Alright, that does it! 
"
Randy,"Hello?
"
Italy,"They justa blew up our government building! Ya got to hurry!
"
Britain,"Mr. Marsh, why won't you finish the Pinewood Derby car?!
"
Randy,"Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
"
Stan,"Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
"
Randy,"Awhuh. 
"
McGee-zax,"Aw zahts, it's the intergalactic police.
"
Randy,"What?! 
"
McGee-zax,"You'd better get rid of 'em or your whole planet is gonna get it, see?!  You tell 'em you ain't seen nothin', you got that?!  I ain't goin' to space jail! 
"
Officer 1,"'Scuse us, Earthlings, but uh, we've been in pursuit of a criminal from the Xenon galaxy. Fella by the name of Baby Fark McGee-zax?
"
Randy,"Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything.
"
Officer 1,"Well, ya think anyone else on your planet might have seen him?
"
Randy,"Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
"
China,"Uh uh no, no, we haven't seen arien.
"
France,"Uh we've seen nothing here in France.
"
Randy,"Sorry, nobody in the world has seen anything. Uh... what did this... criminal alien do, exactly?
"
Officer 1,"He stole over 600 parsohns of space cash from the universal bank. You're absolutely sure you didn't see an alien land here?
"
Randy,"No, we're sure.
"
Officer 1,"So then... we're the first aliens you've ever seen?
"
Randy,"That's right, yep, you're the first ones.
"
Officer 1,"You don't seem that excited about your first contact with alien life.
"
Randy,"...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
"
Officer 1,"If you do see any sign of the other alien or the space cash you-
"
Randy,"We will give you a call!
"
Officer 1,"Mathematical semi-tonal is fine. 
"
Officer 1,"Huh.
"
Officer 2,"Something wrong, sir?
"
Officer 1,"I don't know, Davert. Just somethin' about that planet didn't feel right. 
"
Randy,"Alright son, now you just paint the racing stripe like you did before.
"
McGee-zax,"I don't need it painted, I just need it functional, all right?! 
"
Randy,"Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
"
Scout Leader,"That's true.
"
McGee-zax,"I swear, if you don't have that thing workin' in three minutes this whole planet is done for!
"
Stan,"Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
"
Randy,"No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
"
Stan,"Kill the alien?
"
Randy,"Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
"
Stan,"No. Dad, we don't even know what'll happen.
"
McGee-zax,"What are you two whispering about, riiight?
"
Randy,"Oh no, that's uh that's it. We're done. Uh here. Come, come take a look.
"
Stan,"Dad? 
"
Randy,"Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
"
General,"Alright men, check the ship. 
"
Randy,"You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
"
Stan,"I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
"
Randy,"But Stan, it's over now. We'll never have to lie again.
"
General,"Hey Marsh, get in here! 
"
Stephen,"Can you believe it?
"
Randy,"Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. 
"
General,"Looks like those alien cops were right. Guess you should call them back now.
"
Randy,"Right.  But what if we didn't call the cops?
"
Stephen,"Huh?
"
Randy,"Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
"
Stan,"No, Dad-
"
Mr. Garrison,"He's right. We don't have to call the police back.
"
General,"All right, let's get the cash put into boxes! 
"
Stan,"Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?
"
Randy,"Will you relax, Stan? 
"
Japan,"Don't think you can keep the all the space cash for yourself!
"
Germany,"That's right! This is all of our planet; the space cash belongs to all of us!
"
Australia,"Either America shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops!
"
Randy,"Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
"
Randy,"Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.
"
Officer 1,"Looks like the alien criminal did land here after all.
"
Randy,"Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
"
Officer 1,"And so, did you find the missing space cash?
"
Randy,"Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.
"
Officer 2,"Well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is?
"
Randy,"Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
"
Russia,"No space cash.
"
Japan,"No we haven't-
"
Britain,"No space cash.
"
Brazil,"No.
"
Randy,"Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
"
Officer 1,"Uh huh. Guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet.
"
Randy,"Probably.
"
Officer 1,"Well you folks all take care now.  Just... one more thing, Earthlings, uh... We had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - Mexico? - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days.
"
Randy,"Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
"
Officer 1,"Uh huh. Have a good day. 
"
Randy,"Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
"
Randy,"No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
"
Japan,"Well then why can Engrand build a nuclear power plant?!
"
Randy,"Nobody can build anything!!
"
Britain,"Yeah, well, it's not even gonna matter, because Finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth!
"
Randy,"Wha?! Finland?! 
"
Finland,"We believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did. It's best we come clean now.
"
Randy,"Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
"
Finland,"I'm sorry, but our nation is resolved. We cannot live with the guilt anymore.
"
Randy,"Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
"
Finland,"Very well. 
"
Randy,"All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
"
China,"Yep, we gotta take out Finrand, they gonna squeal.
"
Australia,"Yeah, I think we all agree. Guys? 
"
Randy,"Oh dammit!
"
Randy,"Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
"
Officer 1,"Well we're a little puzzled over one of your countries? Uh, Finland?
"
Randy,"Whaa-wha-what about it
"
Officer 2,"It appears to have been... destroyed.
"
Randy,"Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.
"
Crowd,"Oh no, not Finland.
"
Randy,"Hey guys, Finland's dead.
"
Russia,"Oh no. No! Nooo.
"
Japan,"Noo, not a Finrand!
"
Kenya,"All of Finland, gone.
"
Randy,"Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
"
Officer 1,"None of you knew anything about Finland's destruction?
"
Randy,"No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
"
Officer 2,"We didn't say anything about nukes.
"
Randy,"Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.
"
Stan,"'Scuse me! 'Scuse me!  Everyone, I have an announcement to make. I'm giving back my Pinewood Derby trophy! 
"
Judge,"What?
"
Randy,"Stan?
"
Stan,"The truth is, I don't deserve this trophy. 'Cause I cheated on my Pinewood Derby car. I used something not in the approved kit. 
"
Japan,"Not in the approved kit?!
"
Britain,"He cheated on the Pinewood Derby?
"
Stan,"This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
"
Randy,"Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
"
Officer 1,"Your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words. You sure you Earthlings have nothing else to tell us?
"
Randy,"Hey uh, do we have anything else to tell the space cops?
"
Britain,"Nope.
"
France,"Nope.
"
South Korea,"No changes.
"
Kenya,"Nope.
"
Russia,"No changes.
"
Brazil,"Nope.
"
China,"No. Tell them no.
"
Australia,"No changes.
"
Randy,"Yeah, no, we've told you everything.
"
Officer 1,"All right, that's it then. Come on out sir, it appears to be over. 
"
Randy,"Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!
"
McGee-zax,"My real name is Kevern Zaksor. I am the ambassador to new planet testing. 
"
Britain,"What the hell are they talking about?
"
Kevern Zaksor,"These are not space cops.  There is no space jail, and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth. I mean, how stupid is your species? Space jail? Baby Fark McGee-zax?
"
Randy,"It was... a trick?
"
Officer 2,"Whenever a civilization discovers warp speed, we want to bring them into the Federation of Planets, but first we do the space cash test, to see if that species is worthy of joining.
"
Kevern Zaksor,"Needless to say, you all failed.  People of earth, since you did not return the space cash, your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe. Goodbye. 
"
Randy,"No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!
"
Cartman,"You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
"
Butters,"We can?
"
Stan,"What are you talking about, dude?
"
Cartman,"Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.
"
Clyde,"Somalia? Where's that?
"
Cartman,"North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
"
Butters,"Whoa.
"
Cartman,"I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
"
Kyle,"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
"
Cartman,"Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
"
Cartman,"Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
"
Kyle,"Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
"
Cartman,"Then why don't you wanna go?
"
Kyle,"Well, c-cause dude, I'm Jewish, a-and you know...
"
"Kyle, Cartman","Jews can't be pirates.
"
Cartman,"That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 
"
Kyle,"Please. Please let him go.
"
Gordon Stoltski,"Good morning, students. These are the morning announcements. Teacher-parent conferences have been rescheduled to next Tuesday.  Please inform your parents. The gym is being repainted, and is closed until tomorrow afternoon. And now for a special announcement:
"
Cartman,"Avast there, mateys!  Do ya have a thirst for adventure on the high seas of life?  Arrre you sick and tired of your parents and teachers telling you what to do all the time?

Cartman,"There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
"
Gordon Stoltski,"And for lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving taco salad or hoagie sandwiches. Thank you.

Butters,"Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck!

Cartman,"Attention! All right, you booty lovers! So you decided to join Captain Cartman's edjeh...  Uh, guys, who let in the g-i-n-g-e-r?
"
Clyde,"Well, there's really not that many of us. We figured we should let him join.
"
Cartman,"But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
"
Gordon Stoltski,"Fine, I don't wanna be a pirate anyways! 
"
Cartman,"Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
"
Butters,"Yeah!
"
Cartman,"We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
"
Clyde,"And your mom is okay with that?
"
Cartman,"Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
"
Butters,"Neato!
"
Cartman,"Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! 
"
Butters,"Pirates ho!

Cartman,"Kevin, Goddammit! 
"
Clerk,"Have a good flight. Next, please? 
"
Cartman,"We be headin' to Somaaliaa. By way of Miami to Cairo. And take care o' you put us in an exit row, you land lubber!
"
Clerk,"I see. You five boys are all booked through to Cairo by yourselves?
"
Cartman,"That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
"
Butters,"Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
"
Cartman,"What?!
"
Butters,"It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
"
Clyde,"Yeah maybe we should think about this.
"
Cartman,"You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
"
Butters,"Huh, who, you mean you?
"
Cartman,"Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
"
Butters,"No, I'm sick of it!
"
Cartman,"Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
"
Butters,"He's right, lads. To adventure!
"
Clyde,"This is Somalia?
"
Butters,"Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
"
Cartman,"The FUCK?!  'Scuse me, where are the pirates?  Hey, hey we're looking for the pirates? Where can we find the-uh!  Butters, get the phrase book out.  Ask these people where the pirates are.
"
Butters,"Uhh,  mahjey burazi?
"
Somali 1,"Burad. Iyaja dene zaredeko
"
Somali 2,"Buradi wakuwasa.
"
Butters,"Oh. He-he says they're in there. 
"
Cartman,"Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! 
"
Somali 2,"Mayasuk! Hageha-aden! Letka suwahater! 
"
Cartman,"Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. 
"
Cartman,"Avast!  These aren't pirates, they're just a bunch of black people.
"
Pirate 1,"""Is this some kind of joke?""
"
Pirate 2,"""I don't know what the fuck this is!""
"
Cartman,"I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
"
Pirate 1,"""These white children will bring a high price in ransom money!""
"
Pirate 2,"""Take them out to the nearest European boat! Show them we have children hostages!"" 
"
Cartman,"Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
"
Pirate 3,"""Move it! Go over that way!""
"
Pirate 4,"""We will get a nice ransom for you!"" 
"
Cartman,"Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 
"
Pirate 3,"""Get on board!""
"
Pirate 4,"""Do it now!"" 
"
Cartman,"This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
"
Pirate 3,"""Get on the boat now!""
"
Pirate 4,"""Move!""
"
Cartman,"Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
"
Kevin,"I gotta sit middle 'cause I get motion sickness. 
"
Cartman,"Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!
"
Clyde,"You said there was gonna be crystal clear lagoons and treasure and plunderrrr! 
"
Cartman,"Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
"
Clyde,"No it's not! You made me run away to be a pirate and there's not even any treasure!
"
Cartman,"Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! 
"
French Captain,"""Keep your eyes open, Mr. Leon. These waters are full of renegades and thieves.""
"
Mr. Leon,"""Yes, Captain!"" 
"
Deck Hand,"""Captain! We have an unknown vessel approaching quickly to port!""
"
French Captain,"""Damn pirates! Alert the crew! All hands on deck!"" 
"
Pirate 5,"""We demand ransom for these children! Pay us or we will kill them!""
"
French Captain,"""They've got CHILDREN HOSTAGES!""
"

"
French Captain,"""Get the U.N. on the radio. Advise them of the situation.""

Pirate 5,"""We want 5,000 Euros! You easily have that much on board!""
"
Cartman,"Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!
"
Pirate 4,"""We are going to start killing them! Starting with the fat one!""
"
Cartman,"Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
"
Butters,"ARRRRRRGH!
"
Kyle,"Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
"
Stan,"No, dude, everyone's checked. I think Cartman really ran away to Somalia.
"
Kyle,"Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
"
Stan,"You really think he'll die in Somalia?
"
Kyle,"Oh for sure, dude! It's the most God-forsaken place on the planet! Things are finally gonna be normal around here.
"
Sheila,"Oh God! Oh God, what did we do wrong, Gerald?! 
"
Gerald,"Take it easy. We'll find him.
"
Kyle,"I'll call you back. 
"
Sheila,"Oh Kyle, he's gone! Your little brother's run away from home!
"
Kyle,"What? Are you sure?
"
Sheila,"He left a note saying he's never coming back.
"
Kyle,"""Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
"
Sheila,"Oh Gerald, what are we gonna do?
"
Gerald,"It's alright, he couldn't have gone far. Let's call the other kids' houses. 
"
Kyle,"Oh God. What have I done?
"
Pirate 4,"""We are growing impatient! Give us what we want or they die!""
"
Cartman,"The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
"
French Captain,"""Alright! Alright! We are going to give you what you want! But you must hand over the children UNHARMED!""
"
Pirate 5,"""The money first!""  ""Go! Get on the boat! Move!""
"
Cartman,"Alright, let's go! 
"
Cruise Attendant,"""We got 'em - They're safe!"" 
"
French Captain,"Your crimes will not go unpunished!  Are you kids alright?
"
Cruise Attendant,"""Did they hurt you?""
"
Cartman,"Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
"
French Captain,"""What is this?!""
"
Cartman,"Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
"
Butters,"Okay! 
"
Cartman,"I said, get off my boat!
"
French Captain,"""Hey! You can't order us around!"" 
"
Cartman,"That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs!  Lower 'em down, Ike. 
"
French Captain,"""Scoundrels! You will pay for this!""
"
Butters,"Have a good day! 
"
Cartman,"Hard to port, lads!
"
Clyde,"Hard to port!
"
Butters,"What's ""port""?!
"
Cartman,"Just make the boat go that way, kind of.  That's good. Now bring her around portside.  Now that's a pirate ship!  A fine day o' plunderin' we had, boys! What about yourselves?  Here you are, lads. Plenty of booty to go around.  A round of grog for me boys!  A round of grog for everyone!  The fuck is this? This is water in a Dixie cup! Alright, Goddammit, really you guys!

"
Cartman,"Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.
"
Paolo Captain,"We found then adrift in a lifeboat, sir. They say that pirates took their ship by force.
"
U.N. Leader,"Damn pirates! What's causing them to suddenly be so much more active? Is the crew okay?
"
Paolo Captain,"Yes sir. They're French, so they surrendered immediately.  Once the pirates boarded your ship how did they force you off?
"
French Captain,"Il a vert lightsabeur.
"
Cruise Attendant,"Oui. Un lightsabeur
"
Deck Hand,"Le lightsabeur terrible. 
"
Paolo Captain,"Sir, the pirates appear to have forced the French crew off their boat with a lightsaber.
"
U.N. Leader,"My God, pirates are getting better-equipped every day! Gentlemen, I want the President of the United States on the phone. We can no longer fight the pirates on the seas. We have to take them out where they live.
"
Cartman,"What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?
"
Pirate 6,"""We have a hostage!""
"
Pirate 7,"""Another American arrived on the bus!""
"
Cartman,"Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!
"
Announcer,"The is CNN... N.
"
Anchorman,"Breaking news of yet another pirate crisis in Somalia. Members of NATO received word today that pirates have captured an American child and are demanding ten million Euros for his safe release. U.S Navy ships have been deployed and the pirate standoff is about to get ugly.
"
Cartman,"Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
"
Kyle,"No, fatass, I came to get my brother! We all have to get out of here! It isn't safe.
"
Cartman,"""It isn't safe."" That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was ""awesome.""
"
Kyle,"I know! I was lying then!
"
Cartman,"Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
"
Kyle,"This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
"
Cartman,"Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
"
Butters,"One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
"
Pirate 4,"Ey excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
"
Butters,"Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.
"
Galeed,"Why did you Americans come here?
"
Butters,"Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
"
Ike,"Yeah, homework.
"
Butters,"And our parents hollered at us!
"
Ike,"Yeah.
"
Butters,"So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
"
Ike,"Piewets!
"
Galeed,"But that's not what I do not understand. Why would anyone ""want"" to be a pirate?
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Galeed,"Every day I dream that I can go to school. Learn about the world. But my mother, she is dyin' of AIDS, and there is no money for medicine. My father was killed trying to find food for us. Do you know how I feel every time we try to capture a boat? Scared. And not just scared because I might get killed, but scared because if I don't get something out of it, my family and friends are going to die. I don't want to be a pirate. I don't see how anybody would. 
"
Ike,"Oh my God. 
"
Butters,"Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
"
Ike,"I feel, like an asshole.
"
Butters,"Yeah, me too.
"
Cartman,"Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
"
Kyle,"Cartman, knock it off!
"
Cartman,"That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!
"
Pirate 6,"""Do you think all American kids are as crazy as these are?""
"
Pirate 8,"""It's starting to look that way.""
"
Butters,"Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
"
Cartman,"What?!
"
Butters,"Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
"
Cartman,"Clyde!
"
Clyde,"I hate it here and I wanna go home!! 
"
Cartman,"You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
"
Kyle,"They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
"
Cartman,"Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
"
Pirate 5,"""Hey, what's that?"" 
"
Commander,"Alright men, remember, do not hit the white ones!
"
Cartman,"Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 
"
Sniper,"Clear.
"
Cartman,"The FUCK?!
"
Gerald,"You have been very very naughty!  You're a naughty girl! 
"
Sheila,"Oh yes, Gerald! I've been so naughty!  Ah, oh, oh, oh jeez! Oh! 
"
Gerald,"What the?! ...Ike!  Ike, get back to bed right now!
"
Ike,"I'm scared. There's a ghost.
"
Gerald,"Uh not this again.  Ike, we are sick of you talking about ghosts!
"
Ike,"But Daddy I saw the-
"
Gerald,"No buts! Get back to your room right now and don't come out! You got it?! 
"
Sheila,"Gerald, what has gotten into him?
"
Gerald,"Hoh, I don't know. I think maybe with all the news of famous people dying this summer, he he's just freaked himself out.
"
Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for Megascrub Cleanser.
"
Ike,"AAAAAAAAA!
"
Billy Mays,"Are you tired of your kitchen counters getting those nasty stains? Don't just rub 'em, Megascrub 'em!
"
Ike,"Billy Mays, NO! 
"
Billy Mays,"Mold, mildew, even those impossible wine stains are gone in a flash when you snipe them away.
"
Ike,"MMOOMMMYYY!  AAAAAA! Farrah Fawcett! Farrah Fawcett!  AAAAAA! David Carradine! 
"
Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for Mighty Mend It, the fast and easy way to mend, hem, and wear it again. 
"
Ike,"NOOOOO!
"
Kyle,"Ike! Ike, what?!
"
Ike,"Make Billy Mays go away! Make Billy Mays go away!  Make him stop!  Make him stop, Kyle!
"
Dr. Land,"Now Ike, your family is very worried about you. Ike, you can talk to me. I'm a therapist. Whatever has been troubling you, it's okay.
"
Ike,"No, it's... it's a secret.
"
Dr. Land,"Ike, tell me your secret. I promise not to tell anyone else.
"
Ike,"I see dead... ce-le-bri-ties.
"
Dr. Land,"You mean, you see dead celebrities on TV? In the news?
"
Ike,"I see them walking around. They talk to me.
"
Dr. Land,"Are you seeing any dead celebrities right now?
"
Ike,"Just Ed McMahon. 
"
Dr. Land,"How often do you see dead celebrities?
"
Ike,"All the time. 
"
Cartman,"'Sup, Jew?
"
Kyle,"Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
"
Cartman,"HA! What a dumbass! 
"
Kyle,"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again.
"
Cartman,"Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Cartman,"Your little brother saw the ghost of Billy Mays?
"
Stan,"Dude, I don't even know who that is.
"
Cartman,"The guy on TV who had incredible things for people to buy? He died four months ago but they still show his commercials all the time? Oh, oh for the love of Christ, here!  Here here! This, this is him!
"
Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product. If you're like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle , but you hate all those terrible bloodstains in your underwear .
"
Man 1,"I love Chipotle. But getting all the bloodstains out of my underwear is a nightmare. 
"
Billy Mays,"Well now there's a product that can clean even bloodstains caused by Chipotle right off your underwear. Chipotl-away.  Just one Chipotle burrito  can leave up to a quarter cup of underwear blood , but Chipotl-away  makes your underwear clean  and ready for more.  Stop buying new underwear every time you eat Chipotle. That can cost you thousands. Chipotl-away gets rid of bloodstains and leaves underwear good as new.  Imagine having underwear so clean you can practically eat off of it.
"
Man 2,"Mmm, Chipotle. 
"
Billy Mays,"Now you can eat all the Chipotle you want , and still have underwear that sparkles and shines . Order right now!
"
Cartman,"That product changed my life. It really works. I use it all the time.
"
Kyle,"What?! Are you serious?!
"
Cartman,"Look Kyle, if there's even a chance that Billy Mays' soul is not at rest, then I wanna help however I can.
"
Kyle,"Dude, why the hell would you DO that?!
"
Cartman,"Because he was a great person, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"NO, why the hell would you keep eating something that made you crap blood?!
"
Cartman,"...Dude, have you had Chipotle? It's really good. You guys, we have to help Kyle's brother and get to the bottom of this. And I think I know just who to call...
"
Announcer,"On this episode of Ghost Hunters : a little boy in Colorado appears to be haunted by celebrities.  Now the Ghost Hunter team will roll out and get to the bottom of it. It's the gayest show in the fucking world; Ghost Hunters!
"
Jason,"Alright, tell us what we got this week, Kris.
"
Kris,"We're going to Colorado to investigate celebrity paranorm-
"
Jason,"Wait, what? What was that? What was that?
"
Grant,"I heard it too. It was like a, like a ...*pop*
"
Jason,"Is there a ghost here?
"
Jason,"Alright, so you say a little boy is seeing the ghosts?
"
Kris,"Yeah, apparently only he is seeing them.
"
Jason,"Doyuh ssh ssh. What, what is that? Do you hear that?! There, there look. What is that? What is that?
"
Grant,"I think that's just a cigarette lighter.
"
Jason,"Oh, right, okay. May be.
"
Jason,"We are now inside the house where the celebrity ghosts have been spotted. Whoa whoa what? What was that?
"
Kyle,"What was what?
"
Jason,"Did you hear that? It was like a... it was like a... dee.. Is there a spooky ghost here?? Uh LOOK. What is that? What is that?? 
"
Grant,"I'm pretty sure that's their television.
"
Jason,"Oh man I am really scared.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What is this? What is this? There's a, there's a, a wetness coming from my pants! 
"
Grant,"I see it!
"
Jason,"W... what is it?!
"
Grant,"Oh God I'm so scared!  I'm so scared.
"
Jason,"Look! Look, it's got you too!  Are you getting this? Make sure the camera is getting this. Definitely some paranormal activity!
"
Grant,"It's warm, and moist. A warm moist sensation that's moving down my left thigh. 
"
Jason,"Look, it's starting to form a, a a pool around the floor now. Are you getting this??
"
Stan,"Are you guys fucking serious?
"
Jason,"Oh God, the paranormal activity is now leaving a, a trail of some kind behind both of us! 
"
Grant,"Hoh! Something... hot, and and, warm is coming out the back of my pants now. 
"
Jason,"Oh it smells!
"
TAPS,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
Kyle,"Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
"
Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for the Big City Slider Station.
"
Kyle,"It's all just in your head, Ike.
"
Billy Mays,"The fast and easy way to press and cook delicious sliders
"
Ike,"AAAAA. AAAAAAAAAAA!! 
"
Kyle,"I just... don't understand it.
"
Stan,"It's gonna be alright, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
"
Cartman,"Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
"
Kyle,"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
"
Stan,"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
"
Cartman,"Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
"
Dr. Carroll,"Well boys, little Ike is stable, but the celebrity ghosts appear to have sent him into some kind of coma.
"
Stan,"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?
"
Dr. Carroll,"Well of course there really are ghosts. Haven't you seen that show Ghost Hunters? But I'm a pediatric doctor, so I'm going to hand this off to Dr. Phillips, who specializes in spooky things. 
"
Dr. Phillips,"The ghosts of these celebrities are at deep unrest. I've never sensed anything like it.  I believe these celebrity ghosts are still roamin' the world, reachin' out through the child because they are lost in purgatory.
"
Kyle,"Purgatory? What's that?
"
Dr. Phillips,"Sometimes when people die, they can't quite accept what has happened to them. And so before they reach the afterlife, they go to a place called ""purgatory."" It is a temporary plane of existence. It's neither heaven, nor hell. Purgatory is like... being on an airplane that's waiting to take off, but you're still sitting at the gate. And even though the plane isn't taking off, they won't let you back off the plane. And you can't get up to go to the bathroom, because you're on an active runway. All these dead celebrities are sittin' on the plane waiting and wantin' to move on, but for whatever reason, they are stuck without any information, even from the pilot, how much longer it's going to be, and it's taking forever. And they aren't serving any drinks yet. It's like, a terrifying limbo.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
"
Dr. Phillips,"I am speakin to the celebrities that are hauntin' this child. If any spirit can hear my voice, make your presence known. 
"
Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here with another fantastic product.
"
Cartman,"Billy Mays!  It's him!
"
Billy Mays,"Are you tired of having to put your toilet seat down?
"
Cartman,"Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
"
Walter Cronkite,"No! Be quiet, Billy Mays! Somebody is trying to contact us!
"
Dr. Phillips,"To which celebrity am I addressin' now?
"
Walter Cronkite,"This, is Walter Cronkite.
"
Dr. Phillips,"All you celebrities need to know that you have passed on.
"
Farrah Fawcett,"We know that!
"
DJ AM,"Yeah! Of course we know that!
"
Patrick Swayze,"There's only one person here who's not cooperating!
"
Walter Cronkite,"That's right! Now just admit you're dead and sit down!
"
Michael Jackson,"...No, that's ignorant! I'm not dead.
"
Stan,"Uh oh.
"
Walter Cronkite,"You are dead!
"
Michael Jackson,"No, I just have a skin condition.
"
Dr. Phillips,"Boys, quickly! Convince Michael Jackson that he's dead.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Dr. Phillips,"He's in denial. He's been in denial all his life. Now tell him or you're gonna lose your little brother.
"
Kyle,"Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
"
Michael Jackson,"Nooo, you're being ignorant. I'm alive. And I'm a child. And I'm white.
"
Kyle,"Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
"
Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for the Super Sweeper.
"
The Boys (except Cartman) and Dr. Phillips,"Shut up, Billy Mays!
"
Stan,"You're dead, Mr. Jackson!
"
Michael Jackson,"No, that's, that's just ignorant.
"
Stan,"Accept it! 
"
Michael Jackson,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
Dr. Phillips,"He's in too much denial!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
Kyle,"Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
"
Ike,"Nooo. No, that's ignorant.  Oh look everyone, I told you I was alive.
"
Kyle,"Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
"
Ike,"Wee, I'm a child!  I knew I was a child. See? Come on, let's play! Let's go climb a tree! 
"
Kenny,"(Holy shit, dude!)
"
Kyle,"Comoe back here! 
"
Kyle,"Hey! Heeey!
"
Ike,"Come on, let's climb the tree! Hee hee!
"
Stan,"Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
"
Ike,"Noo, I'm a little white child. Let's play!  Hee! Hee hee!  Hee hee hee! 
"
Kyle,"Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
"
Cartman,"Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
"
Ike,"No, that's ignorant. People are just ignorant and they lie and spread rumors about me. Like, that I'm dead. But if I was dead, how could I do this?  Hoo! Dawdaby daw! Shamon! 
"
Kyle,"What the hell are we going to do??
"
Ike,"Jou know! Jou know it! Hee hee!
"
Ed McMahon,"Come on, this is ridiculous! How much longer do we have to sit in purgatory?!
"
Passengers,"Come on! Come on! This is ridiculous! Come on!
"
Flight Attendant,"Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. I've been informed that we are going to be delayed at least another 96 hours
"
Passengers,"AWWWWWWWW!
"
DJ AM,"Yo, you can't just keep people stuck like this, man!
"
Flight Attendant,"We know that you are all excited to cross over to the next plane, but for now you have to stay on this one.
"
Walter Cronkite,"That's it! I have to go to the bathroom!
"
Flight Attendant,"Sir, you have to stay in your seat with your seatbelt fastened!
"
Walter Cronkite,"You've been saying that for three months now! 
"
Stan,"Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
"
Kyle,"Okay, here's the one part that really makes no sense to me:  the first time you saw blood stains on your underwear, were you alarmed?
"
Cartman,"Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.
"
Kyle,"So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
"
Cartman,"Chipotlaway, Kyle. And I'm not the one who uses it, my mom does. She does the laundry. 
"
Kyle,"Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
"
Cartman,"Yes!
"
Kyle,"And then takes you to Chipotle, and buys you more?
"
Cartman,"Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 
"
Stan,"Here here here it is: possession by a ghost. A ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be. The ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be.
"
Kyle,"What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
"
Cartman,"A child... and a female. And white.
"
Ike,"Oh lookie, it's a planet. Hee hee hee.
"
Stan,"So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
"
Kyle,"Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
"
MC,"Hello. First up we have the beautiful Miss Jessica. 
"
Jessica's Mom,"Alright Jessica! Woohoo! 
"
MC,"Jessica enjoys ridin' her horse Marley and doin' her nails with her sisters. Next, contestant number 26, Miss Brandy 
"
Brandy's Mom,"Yeah Brandy! Work it girl!
"
MC,"Brandy likes ice cream and playing with her cat Sunshine.
"
Brandy's Mom,"Don't forget to blow a kiss to the judges, Brandy. 
"
MC,"And now welcome contestant number 27, little Miss Michael Jackson. 
"
Kyle,"Go on by, Michael. 
"
Cartman,"Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
"
Stan,"Yeahhhh!
"
MC,"Michael says she just enjoys being a child. She loves to play and climb trees, and thinks people who don't are ignorant.
"
Ike,"Ignorant.
"
Cartman,"God I hope this works.
"
Billy Mays,"Hi, Billy Mays here for the little Country Handy Pillow. Are you tired of sitting in limbo? Lost somewhere between planes of existence? Well now there's a product that can help you-
"
Walter Cronkite,"Will somebody shut his fucking mouth?! I can't take it anymore!
"
Patrick Swayze,"This is bad enough without having to constantly listen to you try and sell your stupid crap, Mays!
"
Billy Mays,"With just two easy steps, I can climb over these seats and kick you right in the fucking balls!
"
David Carradine,"That does it. We are not gonna just sit here anymore! We want some Goddamned answers!
"
Walter Cronkite,"Why isn't anybody telling us anything?!
"
Pilot,"Well ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking.
"
Walter Cronkite,"Well it's about fucking time!
"
Pilot,"Certainly want to uhhh thank you for all your patience. We know that you're eager to uhhhh get going and we will certainly pass on any information uhhhhh as it becomes uhhhhhh more available.
"
DJ AM,"But yo! Yo Michael Jackson isn't even here anymore! He's gone! We should be able to move on now!
"
Flight Attendant,"Yes, but as we all know, Mr. Jackson had a LOT of baggage, and he checked some of that baggage in, so a crew has to go through all the baggage and get his off of purgatory before we can push back from the gate.
"
Passengers,"AWWWWWWWW!
"
Ike,"Did I do good in the swimsuit category? I'm worried that little doodoohead brunette girl was prettier than me.
"
Stan,"Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
"
Kylie's Mom,"It's more important for my little Kylie. Just look at this face.
"
Kylie,"Mommy, that hurts my cheek implants. 
"
MC,"All right, thank you Miss Cassie. And now for her talent portion, Miss Michael Jackson is gonna sing for us. 
"
Ike,"I'm just a little girl. Hee hee. A dainty little thing.And I know you all want to be a little white girl like me. Shamohn! Hee hee hee.  Hohhh
"
Stan,"Dude, the two male judges love her.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah.) 
"
An Officer,"All right, that's about enough! 
"
Kyle,"Aww crap!
"
Cartman,"Hey, what the F?!
"
MC,"All right everyone, the judge will now tally her final scores.
"
Kyle,"We're totally screwed!  They took the two best judges away!
"
Stan,"Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
"
Heidi's Mom,"You'll win for sure, Heidi. You know how much that judge adores you.
"
Kyle,"Aw dide, this is hopeless!
"
Kenny,"(Son of a stinking bitch!)
"
Cartman,"Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.
"
Kyle,"So what?!
"
Cartman,"So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
"
Lady Judge,"Oh yes, it's my favorite fast food. I would eat it every day, except I-... 
"
Cartman,"Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
"
Lady Judge,"How did you know-... Look, it doesn't matter.  I'm just gonna have to give it up.
"
Cartman,"What if you didn't have to give it up?
"
Lady Judge,"Excuse me?
"
Cartman,"I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
"
MC,"And now, it is time to announce our Grand Little Miss. Little Miss Michael Jackson. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah!
"
Cartman,"Yeah!
"
Stan,"Woohoo!
"
Cartman,"Good job Ike! 
"
Heidi,"I'm sorry I didn't win, Mommy. 
"
Ike,"Thank you so much for this award. Of all the awards I've ever won, this one means the most. I feel like... I'm finally at rest. I'm finally at rest! I'm free!  Holy shit! What the heck am I wwwearing?
"
Kyle,"Ike!  Ike, you're back!
"
Ike,"Kyle, what the heck is going on?
"
Kyle,"It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
"
Cartman,"Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
"
Michael Jackson,"Wee, I'm free! I'm free! 
"
Farrah Fawcett,"Hey he's here! He's here!
"
Bea Arthur,"Oh, finally.
"
Others,"He's here! He's back!
"
Flight Attendant,"All right everyone, it looks like we are all ready to move on. 
"
Michael Jackson,"Did you all see my crown? 
"
Billy Mays,"Finally! Finally we can all move on!
"
Flight Attendant,"All right, everyone, I'd like to be the first to welcome you to the gates of Hell. Unfortunately, Hell is a tow-in gate.
"
Passengers,"AWWWWWWWW!
"
Cartman,"Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" Come on, dude, ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" 
"
Butters,"I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
"
Cartman,"Alright, your turn Craig.
"
Butters,"Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! 
"
Cartman,"Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
"
Butters,"Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
"
Stan,"Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
"
Cartman,"Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl 
"
Butters,"Uugh!
"
Kyle,"So what?
"
Butters,"So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
"
Craig,"That's right. 
"
Clyde,"You guys, we got it!  We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars.
"
Butters,"Sellin' kisses?
"
Clyde,"She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
"
Butters,"You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
"
Clyde,"So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
"
Butters,"Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
"
Cartman,"Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
"
Kyle,"Butters, I think you should reconsider this.
"
Butters,"Uh, how come?
"
Kyle,"Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
"
Cartman,"Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
"
Butters,"I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
"
Butters,"Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?
"
Francis,"Pretty worth it. 
"
Jimmy,"Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.
"
Butters,"I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.
"
Sally,"Hey. 
"
Butters,"So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
"
Sally,"Okay, cool.
"
Butters,"Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. 
"
Sally,"So you got money?
"
Butters,"Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
"
Sally,"All right, you ready? 
"
Butters,"Thank you! 
"
Cartman,"Atta boy Butters!
"
Tweek,"You did it!
"
Jimmy,"You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
"
Token,"Good job, Butters!
"
Butters,"Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now.  Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money.  Hey, I know.
"
Butters,"Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
"
Scott,"She'll kiss anybody?
"
Butters,"Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!
"
Scott,"Wow.  It's almost like having someone care about you. 
"
Sally,"Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again.
"
Butters,"Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
"
Sally,"Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class.
"
Butters,"Aww nuts!  Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?
"
Sally,"What?
"
Butters,"Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
"
Sally,"Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding.
"
Butters,"We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
"
Butters,"The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
"
Sally,"Wow, that's a great idea, Butters.
"
Butters,"Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
"
Megan,"Got it.
"
Butters,"I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
"
Sally,"This is gonna be great!
"
Murphy,"Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible ""prostitution company"" starting up in South Park.
"
Yates,"What?!  Hohoo, not in my county!
"
Murphy,"We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from.
"
Yates,"So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
"
Murphy,"Sting operation, sir?
"
Yates,"We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!
"
Yates,"Hey baby, you looking for a party?
"
Driver,"Ha... how much are you charging?
"
Yates,"Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra.
"
Driver,"Aww- get in. 
"
Yates,"Right here's good, sexy.  Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex.
"
Driver,"Ok-okay. 
"
Yates,"All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants.  All right! Here we go. 
"
Driver,"Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick.
"
Yates,"Oh that's all right.  Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE!  You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
"
Driver,"Awhuh! What?!
"
Yates,"This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution.  Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking.
"
Kyle,"Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
"
Stan,"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
"
Kenny,"(Stacey Anderson?) 
"
Butters,"Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
"
Stan,"Butters, you're the one doing all this?
"
Butters,"Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. 
"
Cartman,"Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
"
Butters,"I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
"
Kyle,"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
"
Butters,"...A pimp. Huh...
"
Butters,"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
"
Sally,"Oh. 
"
Butters,"Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.
"
Butters,"Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
"
Bishop,"You? You be pimpin?
"
Butters,"Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
"
Bishop,"Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game.
"
Butters,"What's the game?
"
Bishop,"The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your ""bottom bitch."" That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?
"
Butters,"Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
"
Pimp 2,"See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?
"
Butters,"I know what you're saying.
"
Pimp 2,"Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?
"
Butters,"Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
"
Stephen,"There you are, Butters!
"
Butters,"Hey Dad!
"
Stephen,"Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend?  Sally Darson?
"
Butters,"Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
"
Driver 2,"I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?
"
Yates,"No way! Let's just get to this, baby.
"
Driver 2,"Alright.
"
Yates,"So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?
"
Driver 2,"Sure, I have the money right here.
"
Murphy,"Remember, he's going to give us the code word to move in. Wait for the code word, ""stretch.""
"
Officer,"Code word is ""stretch,"" copy?
"
Yates,"Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down.
"
Driver 2,"Oh, you feel good.
"
Yates,"Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are.
"
Driver 2,"Oh yes. That's great. 
"
Yates,"Yeah, you like it?
"
Driver 2,"Oh, I love it!
"
Yates,"Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!
"
Yates,"Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!
"
Driver 2,"Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!
"
Yates,"Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!
"
Yates,"Teach this little whore a lesson!
"
Driver 2,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
Yates,"Yeah, that's right!
"
Driver 2,"Awww, awwwww, awwwwoh!  Awh.  Oh, oh man!  Thank you! That was great.
"
Yates,"Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a...  STRETCH.
"
Murphy,"Uhhh, that, that's it. Move in! 
"
Driver 2,"Oh God! It's the police!
"
Yates,"Freeze!  You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! 
"
Driver 2,"Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!
"
Yates,"A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street.
"
Groundskeeper,"That's it recess is over back to class.
"
Kids,"Aaaaaaah.
"
Butters,"Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
"
Ashley,"So wait, you're keeping all the money now?
"
Butters,"I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
"
Butters,"Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo.
"
Bebe,"What?
"
Butters,"Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
"
Bebe,"What?!
"
Butters,"Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
"
Bebe,"Shut up!
"
Butters,"Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
"
Wendy,"Leave me alone.
"
Butters,"Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
"
Stan,"Butters. Dude!
"
Butters,"What?
"
Stan,"You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
"
Butters,"Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
"
Wendy,"Stan!
"
Stan,"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
"
Butters,"Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
"
Clyde,"Wow wee. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, we've created a monster.
"
Butters,"Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!
"
Butters,"All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
"
Butters,"Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
"
Kyle,"Butters, I really think we should talk.
"
Butters,"Sure, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong.
"
Butters,"Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
"
Kyle,"Butters, what's happened to you?
"
Butters,"What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
"
Frat Boy 1,"Alpha Tau Omega, woo!
"
Frat Boy 2,"ATOs!
"
Frat Boy 3,"Alright, ATOs, our little Kevin is twenty one today!  And so, Kevin, we would like to welcome you to manhood. Our gift to you. 
"
Frat Boys,"Eewwww!
"
Singer,"Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me,
Calling me all the time like Blondie.
Check out my Chrissie behind,
It's fine all of the time.
Like sex on the beaches,
What else is in the teaches of peaches?
Huh, what?
"
Yates,"Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya!  Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE!  Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom!  Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. 
"
Murphy,"Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?
"
Yates,"What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community!  Oh, hold on, that's my daddy.  Hey Daddy.
"
Bishop,"Where you at, bitch? I need my bottom bitch right now.
"
Yates,"Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way.
"
Bishop,"I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?
"
Yates,"Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. 
"
Black Bitch,"Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?
"
White Bitch,"He's an asshole.
"
Black Bitch,"You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him.
"
White Bitch,"A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up. 
"
Butters,"And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
"
Charise,"Did I do good, Daddy?
"
Butters,"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
"
Charise,"Thank you, Daddy. 
"
Butters,"Mmmwhoa boy!
"
Butters,"And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
"
Receptionist,"And exactly what kind of business are you running?
"
Butters,"It's a kissing company.
"
Receptionist,"And you're making a profit?
"
Butters,"Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
"
Receptionist,"Do you keep any record of the men getting these ""kisses""?
"
Butters,"'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
"
Receptionist,"Senator Morris?
"
Butters,"Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
"
Receptionist,"Where?
"
Butters,"In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
"
Receptionist,"Alright, get out of here! 
"
Butters,"Huh? Why?
"
Receptionist,"I'm not falling for it!
"
Butters,"But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
"
Receptionist,"We aren't giving you anything; get out! 
"
Boss,"Mrs. Davis, is there some kind of problem?
"
Receptionist,"Eh no sir.
"
Butters,"Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
"
Butters,"Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
"
Sally,"Okay.
"
Charise,"Ubup. Daddy, how come this ho get to be bottom bitch?
"
Sally,"What?
"
Charise,"I make the most money for you Daddy, that means if anyone should be bottom bitch, it's me.
"
Sally,"Hey, screw off, ho.
"
Charise,"Fair is fair, ho.
"
Butters,"Whoa whoa, bitches, bitches!
"
Yates,"Excuse me!  Well well well, this must be the organization I've been hearing so much about. Took me a long time to find you. You won't believe the hardships I've been through trying to track you down. My name is Yolanda. I'd like to know all about your operation here. You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?
"
Butters,"Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
"
Yates,"Well, I think that's about all I need to hear.
"
Bishop,"Yolanda!  Yolanda!
"
Butters,"What's that?
"
Bishop,"Yolanda please! You gotta come back to me! I got nothin' without you!
"
Yates,"You've got a lot of nerve coming here, Keshawn! After the way you treated me? I need a pimp that doesn't beat me every time he gets drunk!
"
Bishop,"Yolanda, I looove you. I need you. Not as my bottom bitch. I want...  I want to marry you. 
"
Yates,"It's too late for that, Keshawn! I just told this pimp I was his bitch now.
"
Butters,"Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
"
Bishop,"Thanks, pimp. You done changed the game, that's what you did.  Marry me Yolanda? We'll move to a little château in Switzerland and get away from all this.
"
Yates,"Oh Keshawn! 
"
Butters,"Wha? Awww.
"
Bishop,"I love you so much.
"
Yates,"Babe, I love you too.
"
Bishop,"So much, baby.
"
Yates,"Let's, uh, let's just be happy okay?
"
Bishop,"Promise, babe. Promise.
"
Butters,"Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 
"
Butters,"Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
"
Bishop,"Happy anniversary baby.  Do you like 'em?
"
Yates,"I love 'em, darling.
"
Bishop,"I wanted to get you something extra-special.
"
Yates,"Well hold on. I've got something for you too, my love. I just put it right over here by the...  FREEZE!! Ha! You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!
"
John Cena,"Say that again, Edge! You think you're better than me?!
"
Edge,"Cena, your mouth has gotten you in trouble for the last time! I'm gonna shut it up for you!
"
Spectators,"Oooooooooooooooooooooo!
"
Darryl Weathers,"Bust him up, Edge!
"
Obese Woman,"Kick his ass! WOO!
"
John Cena,"Oh yeah?! I've got somethin' else to tell you, Edge! I slept with Vanessa last night. 
"
Redneck 1,"Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend?
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!
"
Stan,"I'm having the best time!
"
Edge,"You cheated, and took my belt from me, and now I can't hardly get work wrestling! You took muh girl AND you took my job! 
"
Darryl Weathers,"He took his job!
"
Redneck 2,"He took his jrrr?
"
Redneck 3,"Took hid drrr! 
"
Cartman,"Oh, sweet! 
"
Edge,"Whoa... 
"
Butters,"Yes! Yehhehehes!
"
Cartman,"This is awesome!
"
Cartman,"Dude! That was so badass!
"
Kyle,"Wrestling is awesome!
"
Stan,"This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
"
Cartman,"The fuck is this?!
"
Stan,"Why did they have us put on long underwear.
"
Kyle,"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
"
Butters,"Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
"
Kyle,"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
"
Cartman,"I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
"
Coach,"Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling.
"
Kyle,"Cool!
"
Stan,"Yeah!
"
Butters,"Let's do this!
"
Cartman,"All right!
"
Coach,"Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?
"
Cartman,"The Rad Russian.
"
Coach,"What?
"
Cartman,"You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
"
Coach,"Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees.
"
Cartman,"Huh?
"
Coach,"Just, down on, down on the floor.  Hands and knees. 
"
Cartman,"Okay...
"
Coach,"Alright and now how about you. Your name is?
"
Butters,"Triceratops!
"
Coach,"Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position.  Here- we- go.
"
Cartman,"The fuck is this?!
"
Coach,"Now just reach around him here. Good.
"
Cartman,"Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
"
Coach,"Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!
"
Cartman,"That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
"
Stan,"Yeah, what are you? A child molester?
"
Kyle,"Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
"
Coach,"Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night!
"
The Boys,"Yeah! 
"
Coach,"Ugh.  The WWE is not wrassling! That's a bunch of fake bullcrap! How stupid are you! Real wrassling, boys, is this! 
"
Cartman,"Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 
"
Stan,"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
"
Butters,"I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
"
Coach,"Rrrgh!
"
Cartman,"The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap.
"
Jimmy,"Sounds good.
"
Cartman,"Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
"
Butters,"Okey doke.
"
Jimmy,"So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
"
Cartman,"Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
"
Butters,"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
"
Cartman,"Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
"
Stan,"Yup.
"
Cartman,"Alright, let's start wrestlin'. 
"
Jimmy,"I am gonna k-kick your ass!
"
Cartman,"You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 
"
Butters,"Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
"
Cartman,"Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!
"
Jimmy,"Your girlfriend is a whore!
"
Cartman,"Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
"
Jimmy,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
Token,"You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!
"
Stan,"We'll see about that!
"
Butters,"Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
"
Redneck 4,"What's goin' on?
"
Redneck 5,"Apparently that crippled kid slept with that Russian kid's girlfriend.
"
Redneck 4,"Jeez they're so young.
"
Kyle,"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
"
Butters,"That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
"
Stan,"You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
"
Cartman,"And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
"
Stan,"I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
"
Redneck 6,"That kid was in 'Nam? Man, that's incredible!
"
Redneck 7,"Good for you for serving your country!
"
Redneck 8,"Guys, check this out! There's this little kid from the Congo, who was raised by panthers!
"
Redneck 9,"Are you serious?
"
Kyle,"Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
"
Token,"I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
"
Redneck 10,"That kid in the hat is havin' sex with two different girls?
"
Redneck 11,"Naw, that little kid from the Congo lied about one of them to try and get the kid in the hat in trouble with his wife.
"
Redneck 12,"They're married?
"
Jimmy,"You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back
"
Cartman,"I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
"
Redneck 9,"That Russian kid's got hepatitis?
"
Announcer,"And here he comes now, the cold-blooded wrestler from Mexico, El Pollo Loco! 
"
Jimmy,"What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?
"
Kenny,"(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
"
Kyle,"Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!
"
Stan,"You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
"
Kyle,"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
"
Announcer,"Uh oh, here she comes now! It's Bad Irene! 
"
Cartman,"Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
"
Stan,"What?!
"
Redneck 13,"No! No! What are you doing?! Stan the Man loves you!
"
Redneck 14,"Don't break his heart!
"
Stan,"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
"
Cartman,"It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
"
Kyle,"Irene, no! Why?
"
Cartman,"Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
"
Redneck 15,"Whoa, did you hear that?
"
Redneck 16,"Shh!
"
Stan,"Irene, you said you loved me!
"
Cartman,"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 
"
Spectators,"Ohhhh!  Ahhhh!
"
Darryl Weathers,"I'm telling you guys, you've got to see this. These kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine.
"
Redneck 13,"There's this one kid, he saw his father get murdered. And yesterday he finds the killer, and it's this other kid whose an ex-cop. Needless to say, he whupped his ass good.
"
Darryl Weathers,"Yup, and there's this little girl, she's actually addicted to gettin' abortions. Got pregnant by nearly every boy there.
"
Redneck 17,"You're shittin' me!
"
Redneck 13,"No! We're telling you these kids are fucking crazy! You gotta check it out! 
"
Darryl Weathers,"You can watch 'em almost every afternoon. It's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen.
"
Coach,"It isn't real! Don't you people understand that stuff isn't real?! None of it! How stupid are you?! 
"
Redneck 13,"What do you mean, it ain't real?
"
Coach,"It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!
"
Darryl Weathers,"Mister, there's a little girl out there who's had fourteen abortions, an' she ain't even ten yet. But I guess that's just  ""not real"" to you!  Son of a bitch.
"
Coach,"Look look look!  THIS is wrestling. THIS. 
"
Darryl Weathers,"Mister, you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar.
"
Stan,"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
"
Kyle,"Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
"
Cartman,"Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
"
Butters,"Yeah!
"
Kyle,"Let's do this! One! Two!
"
Boys,"Backyard wrestling!
"
Cartman,"Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.
"
Stan,"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
"
Redneck 13,"Gee, I didn't know his parents did that.
"
Redneck 18,"Shhh.
"
Principal Victoria,"I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary.
"
Coach,"You're firing me? Why?!
"
Principal Victoria,"The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. 
"
Coach,"No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!
"
Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds.
"
Coach,"You can't fire me for what these kids do!
"
Principal Victoria,"That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
"
Coach,"What do you mean?
"
Principal Victoria,"We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors.
"
Kyle,"So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
"
Token,"Oh! Sure, that works.
"
Cartman,"You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!
"
Kyle,"What dude? 
"
Cartman,"We just received a letter from the WWE.
"
Stan,"From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
"
Butters,"No way!
"
Cartman,"""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.""
"
Stan,"Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
"
Kyle,"This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
"
Stan,"Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
"
Kyle,"Oh my God... Oh my God...
"
Token,"I can't believe it's him.
"
Butters,"I'm freaking out...
"
Kyle,"Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
"
Cartman,"Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
"
Stan,"Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
"
Darryl Weathers,"Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number.
"
Redneck 19,"Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues. 
"
Darryl Weathers,"Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.
"
Kyle,"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
"
Stan,"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
"
Butters,"Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
"
Kyle,"I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
"
Redneck 20,"He don't run from fights, just from responsibilities. 
"
Crowd,"Oohhhhh!  Boooooooo!
"
Stan,"What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 
"
Announcer,"It's El Pollo Loco! 
"
Cartman,"Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
"
Cartman,"Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, we've been talking.)
"
Cartman,"And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
"
Stan,"Yeah?
"
Cartman,"Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy.
"
Kenny,"(Yep.)
"
Kyle,"What are you talking about?
"
Cartman,"Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
"
Stan,"He's right.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Stan,"Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token.
"
Cartman,"Right?
"
Stan,"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
"
Kyle,"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
"
Cartman,"No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
"
Kenny,"(They're gonna hurt our chances.)
"
Cartman,"Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
"
Kyle,"So what do we do?
"
Kenny,"(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)
"
Cartman,"Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
"
Stan,"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
"
Kyle,"How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
"
Cartman,"It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
"
Cartman,"Number seventeen step forward, please?  You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!
"
Number 17,"You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-
"
Cartman,"Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
"
Number 24,"Your father! Your own father!  I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!
"
Cartman,"Thank you. 
"
Kyle,"That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
"
Kenny,"(Mhm.)
"
Stan,"Yeah yeah, not bad.
"
Cartman,"Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
"
Number 37,"Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old. My father... he liked it too. Until he died.  Sometimes I think it's 'cause of him I followed this dream. 
All my life, all I ever wanted was to
Beeeee a wrestler
Fiiiiighting in the ring
Winning that belt.
And so I dreamed every night that I was the
Uuuuundertaaker
Smaaaaashing skulls in
Breaking arms.
But I'm so worked up. This is something I can do.
Do I have what it takes inside?
"
Stan,"Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, this guy crushes.
"
Coach Connors,"It isn't fair. All my hard work.  I'm not going to take it anymore.  That wrestling show is in for a big surprise.  I'm putting an end to this once and for all!  Hyaaaaa!
"
Kyle,"He's here! Vince McMahon is here! 
"
Jimmy,"Oowow, it's really him.
"
Stan,"He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
"
Cartman,"Alright, places everyone.
"
Cartman,"Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. 
"
Stan,"Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?
"
Kyle,"You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
"
Stan,"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
"
Kyle,"Wait a minute. Who is that?
"
Stan,"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. 
"
Kyle,"You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!
"
Cartman,"My man can do whatever he wants.
"
Coach Connors,"Stay calm, you know what you have to do.
"
Cartman,"You're just gonna have to deal with that.
"
Coach Connors,"For the good of real wrassling. 
"
Butters,"No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
"
Cartman,"My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic.
"
Stan,"No, you can't possibly mean that-!
"
Cartman,"Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
"
Crowd,"Awwwww!
"
Butters,"There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!
"
Number 37,"Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?
"
Redneck 21,"He's alive!
"
Cartman,"You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
"
Assistant,"What do you thnk?
"
Stan,"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.
"
Vince,"They are decent wrestlers. We'll see how they develop their through lines in the second act. 
"
Jimmy,"Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
"
Butters,"Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
"
Guard,"Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits
"
Butters,"Are you sure?
"
Coach Connors,"Oh don't mind me.  I was just about to- 
"
Guard,"Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?
"
Cartman,"O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
"
Stan,"When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!
"
Butters,"He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
"
Jimmy,"Lies! These are all a bunch of lies!  Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!
"
Kenny,"(I can keep the baby...)
"
Cartman,"Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
"
Coach Connors,"Only one shot.  Maximum damage.  This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING!  NO! 
"
Fan 1,"O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!
"
Fan 2,"Bastardos! 
"
Coach Connors,"No! No, shut up!  You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling! 
"
Redneck 22,"We want some real wrestlers!
"
Coach Connors,"This is just a bunch of garbage! And you are all ruining the good name of wrassling!  Wrassling is from ancient Greece! It's in the Olympics!
"
Darryl Weathers,"What the hell do you care?! Get off the wrestlin' mat! Boo!
"
Coach Connors,"Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!
"
Crowd,"Huh? What?
"
Redneck 5,"They took his job.
"
Redneck 23,"I know. Sshh. 
"
Coach Connors,"You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother.
"
Darryl Weathers,"Oh man, they took his job?
"
Redneck 13,"They took hid-drr.
"
Coach Connors,"Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!
"
Redneck 24,"They took his dog!
"
Redneck 25,"They tok hid-drr!
"
Redneck 5,"Took hid-drrr!
"
Coach Connors,"I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spent the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!
"
Redneck 26,"They broke his jaw!
"
Redneck 22,"Theeyy broke his jaw!
"
Redneck 27,"Brk hij-jrr! 
"
Coach Connors,"So you see I have nothing left. Nothing! Not even the will to live. 
"
Vince,"Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen.
"
Coach Connors,"What?
"
Vince,"Will you not join our wrestling organization? I promise to make you our leading act.
"
Coach Connors,"You, you mean it?
"
Vince,"Come! I want to get you in rehearsals right away! 
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Stan,"Dude.
"
Cartman,"Hey, what about us? Our show? 
"
Vince,"Sorry boys. You are decent wrestlers, but lack the raw wrestling talent this man has.
"
The Boys,"Aaaaah.
"
Cartman,"This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
"
Kyle,"Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
"
Jimmy,"Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
"
Stan,"What?? 
"
Jimmy,"You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!
"
Stan,"Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 
"
Redneck 28,"What the hell's this?
"
Redneck 29,"This is Goddamned fake!
"
Darryl Weathers,"Screw this, this is just stupid. 
"
Cartman,"Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
"
Redneck 30,"FAKE!
"
Cartman,"Kenny! I'm-
"
Trainer 1,"All right, everyone, welcome to the Dolphin Encounter here at the Denver Aquarium.  My name is Chet and I'll be your guide and trainer as you meet these intelligent and truly magical creatures.  And here they come: this is Trigger and Dolly, uh there's Bubbles
"
Stan,"Wow cool.
"
Randy,"Pretty neat birthday, huh Stan?
"
Stan,"Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
"
Chet,"If they come near you you can touch their back just no grabbing please. What whimsical creatures aren't they? All the dolphins you will be encountering today are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. Now who would like to get a kiss from one?
"
Girl,"I would like to-
"
Randy,"MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
"
Trainer 1,"Uh all right, let's just uh, get you to put your hands, palms down, on the water.  The- 
"
Stan,"What the hell is that? 
"
Trainer 2,"Oh no it's the Japanese! 
"
Japanese Man 1,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck youuu dofiiin!
"
Japanese Man 2,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you dofiiin! 
"
Guide,"These are our favorite animals here at the Atlanta Zoo. It's Dolly and Seymour. They are beluga whales. These whales live mostly in the Arctic region- 
"
Japanese Man 3,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, whaaales!
"
Trainer 3,"All right Jessica, now put your arms down like this.  Great job, Jessica!
"
Japanese Man 4,"Fuck you, whaaale! 
"
Trainer 3,"AAAAAAAA!
"
Randy,"Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
"
Stan,"Dad, why did they do that?
"
Randy,"Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 
"
Commentator 1,"Dan Dierdorf here, welcoming you to this great football matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins. We're all set for kickoff and- 
"
Commentator 2,"Oh Dan it looks like Japanese people are now rushing onto the field.  This is not the kind of thing you want happening during kickoff. 
"
Japanese Man 5,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you, dofiiin!
"
News Anchor,"Several whales and dolphins were again slaughtered by the Japanese today, this time at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom near San Francisco.  Aquariums had been experimenting with methods to keep the Japanese out, but so far nothing seems to stop them. When asked if all of Japan supported the slaughtering of whales and dolphins, the current Prime Minister of Japan, Yukio Hatoyama, had this to say
"
Hatoyama,"(In Japanese Accent) Fuck you weiru , anda fuck you dohfiiin! 
"
Cartman,"Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.
"
Stan,"Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
"
Cartman,"What do you mean? This song is sweet.
"
Stan,"No, not the song. I'm talking about the Japanese killing whales and dolphins.
"
Kyle,"Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
"
Stan,"So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
"
Kyle,"What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
"
Stan,"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
"
Cartman,"I'm not too busy, Stan.
"
Stan,"You're not?
"
Cartman,"No, I just don't care. At all.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, me neither.)
"
Stan,"Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
"
Cartman,"Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
"
Stan,"You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
"
Cartman,"I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be.
I don't give a crap 'bout whales so go and hug a tree.
"
Butters,"Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
"
Stan,"Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?
"
Butters,"Nononono, I got stuff to do. But I wanted to tell you there's these fellers on TV. They go out in the ocean an' try to stop the Japanese wherever they are.
"
Stan,"Really?  People who are doing something?
"
Butters,"I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
"
Stan,"Then that's where I belong.
"
Singer,"The world is a vampire, sent to drain.
"
Captain Paul Watson,"Yeah, we're badass.
"
Singer,"Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.
"
Male Crew 1,"Any means necessary! We're not protesters, we're pirates! 
"
Captain,"That's definitely a Japanese boat.  Looks like they're whaling now. 
"
Japanese Sailor,"Fuck youuu, weiruu!
"
First Mate,"Oh my God, they're gonna kill those humpbacks!
"
Woman,"We've gotta do something!
"
Captain,"Pull up next to them. The fight is on!
"
Stan,"Sweet! 
"
Captain,"Are we ready to do this?
"
Crew,"Yeah!
"
Stan,"Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
"
Captain,"Are we badasses?
"
"Crew, Stan","Yeah!
"
Captain,"Are we badasses?
"
"Crew, Stan","Yeah!
"
Captain,"All right, so... what do we do?  Wait, I know. How about we go on their ship, and then beat ourselves up? And then we can tell the media they did it?
"
Crewman,"Great idea, Captain!
"
Aussie Crewman,"I'll start right now. 
"
Woman,"""Oy my God, Luke's been hurt trying to save whales.""
"
Captain,"Wait, wait wait. I've got a better idea. How about I pretend to be shot? Then we can tell the media the Japanese shot me, a-and start an international c-crisis?
"
Stan,"Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
"
Captain,"Why not?
"
Stan,"Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
"
Captain,"You know what? He's right. It's time to bring out the big guns! You guys ready?  Ready? And... throw the stinky butter at them! 
"
Luke,"Haha, you stink now! Haha!
"
Stan,"Wait, that's it?
"
Captain,"Yeah, we make 'em stink. Haha your boat is stinky! Here, th- here, throw one.
"
Stan,"Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
"
Captain,"Well no, that'd be illegal.
"
Crewman 2,"Yeah.
"
Stan,"I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
"
Woman,"I'm a pirate in a war.
"
Stan,"Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
"
Captain,"We are. People think our methods are extreme. But we'll keep making their boats stink as long as they're killing whales and dolphins!
"
Luke,"The Japanese are scared of how hardcore we are. 
"
Woman,"Paul! 
"
Crewman,"Paul?
"
Crewman 2,"What do we do?
"
Woman,"We don't have a captain!
"
Crewman,"Oh my God, oh my God!
"
Woman 2,"Maybe he's okay.
"
Crewman 2,"Oh my God.
"
Luke,"What did you do?
"
Stan,"What you assholes acted like you were doing? 
"
Stan,"Wait for it... wait for it... NOW! 
"
The Japanese,"Ohhhh Gojira! Gojira! 
"
Hatoyama,"Nippon no gaijin!  Kuso, taberu na! 
"
Announcer,"And now, Larry King, live.
"
Larry King,"My guest tonight is the little boy who took over the Whale Wars reality show and turned it into a big hit. Please welcome Stan Marsh and his crew.
"
Luke,"'Ey Jordan! I'm on Larry King, mate!
"
Larry King,"So Stan, what motivated you, what... inspired you to get out there and make a hit TV show?
"
Stan,"No I, I don't really care about the TV show, I'm just trying to stop the Japanese from killing dolphins and whales.
"
Larry King,"Once you became captain the methods used to stop the Japanese definitely became more aggressive. Was that the key to help boost your ratings?
"
Stan,"...No, I don't care about the show.
"
Woman 2,"We're pirates.
"
Stan,"I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
"
Woman 2,"I've got balls! 
"
Larry King,"Well there are many people who see what you're doing as a positive thing, and of course, many that see problems with it. Joining us now is one of those people and...  You say Stan's methods are unethical.
"
Sid,"Larry, you can't just go out and take matters into your own hands like this. If you want a hit TV show you have to go through producers, directors, people that are in unions.
"
Larry King,"But Sid, you saw the show before Stan took it over; you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama.
"
Sid,"Yes, but it doesn't justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network.
"
Stan,"Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
"
Larry King,"But their old captain, Paul Watson , was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause.
"
Sid,"He yes, of course, everyone knows that Paul Watson was a smug, narcoleptic liar with no credibility, but we must-
"
Stan,"Screw this, I gotta get back to work!
"
Announcer,"On this episode of Real Actual Whale Wars, Captain Marsh searches for the Japanese fleet, knowing they could be absolutely anywhere. 
"
Stan,"Would you mind stepping back a little?
"
Luke,"Captain! Captain, some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade! 
"
Stan,"No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
"
Luke,"But they say you know them. 
"
Cartman,"Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .
"
Stan,"Oh no, no, NO.
"
Cartman,"What dude?
"
Stan,"Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
"
Cartman,"We always have.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, totally!)
"
Stan,"I asked you guys to help me and you said no!
"
Cartman,"That's not what we said.
"
Stan,"You said ""Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!""
"
Cartman,"We were talking about Wales the country.
"
Stan,"Look, if you admit that you're only doing this because you wanna be on TV, then I'll consider it! Admit you just wanna be on TV!
"
Kenny,"(I just want to be on TV.)
"
Cartman,"Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.
"
Crewman 2,"Captain! Captain, the Japanese have been spotted near buoy 24!
"
Stan,"Take us out of port! All hands to stations!
"
Cartman,"All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 
"
Announcer,"Captain Marsh races his boat to the last known location of the Japanese whalers. If he doesn't get there in time, hundreds of dolphins or whales could die.
"
Stan,"As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 
"
Crewman 2,"What the hell was that?!
"
Crewman 3,"We just got rammed.
"
Stan,"Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
"
Crewman 4,"It's not the Japanese.
"
Stan,"What? 
"
Announcer,"On deck the crew is surprised at what they see. The other boat is from Deadliest Catch, a crab-fishing reality show.
"
DC Captain,"You think you're so cool, don'tcha?! You think you're big boat reality show on the block?!  You're taking away men's livelihoods!
"
Stan,"What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
"
DC Captain,"You're taking viewers away from our show, you stupid ass!
"
Cartman,"Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
"
DC Crewman,"Your show is fuckin' gay!
"
Stan,"Screw this! Turn hard to port! 
"
Announcer,"But everywhere his reality show's boat turns, the crab fishing reality boat block its path. 
"
Stan,"Dude, fuck you!
"
DC Captain,"Fuck you!
"
Announcer,"It's been three hours and the crab fishing reality show isn't budging.  Captain Marsh's boat is dead in the water. He can't go after the Japanese, he can't help the whales or dolphins. Once again on Whale Wars, nothing is happening.
"
Crewman 3,"It's pretty difficult times because uh, we know that every minute we're sitting here stopped, a, another whale is dying.
"
Cartman,"Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
"
Kenny,"(And they're all shot.) 
"
Cartman,"Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
"
Kenny,"(I would do anything!) 
"
Announcer,"The crab-fishing reality show was doing just fine. 
"
DC Crew,"Yeah! Woohoo! Alright! 
"
Announcer,"But for the Whale Wars crew, it appears the show is over. Until... a sound is heard. 
"
Stan,"What was that? 
"
Benjamin,"Captain, look!
"
The Crew,"Wow. Whoa. 
"
Woman 2,"The whales are taking out the crab fisherman reality show!
"
Stan,"It's like... they know. 
"
DC Crewmen,"Hey. Heeey. Noo! Stop! 
"
Stan,"They do know. They know everything I've been trying to do for them.
"
Cartman,"Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 
"
Japanese Pilot,"Bonzaaaaaaaai! 
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
"
Woman 2,"Look out! 
"
Stan,"I, I can't, I can't believe it.
"
Cartman,"Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.
"
Cartman,"Well I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Japanese prison got me down
Said I'm in Japanese prison Lawd
Don't belong here, my eyes are round.
"
Stan,"Will you stop that?
"
Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
"
Stan,"Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
"
Cartman,"You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
"
Guard,"Itte kure 'Akihito-sama irashaimasu!' 
"
Emperor Akihito,"So, you are the ones who have been-a sinking our boats!
"
Stan,"You speak English.
"
Emperor Akihito,"You have caused us many problems, set us back many months!
"
Cartman,"Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, can we go?)
"
Emperor Akihito,"Why have you done this? Why do you insist on-a making trouble for the Japanese?!
"
Stan,"Why do you do what you do?! Do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling?! Why can't you just stop?!
"
Emperor Akihito,"You think you have the right to tell us what is okay?! I have-a something to show you!
"
Emperor Akihito,"This is Hiroshima. Over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb. We built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened. 
"
Cartman,"What dude?
"
Emperor Akihito,"At-a 8:15 a.m. the people of Hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all.  Women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated.  Those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all. Burns, radiation poisoning. For generations the radiation affected the victims. Japanese babies born without rimbs. Without eyes! 
"
Cartman,"Sorry.  A little gassy. 'Scuse me.
"
Emperor Akihito,"One hundred and forty thousand Japanese were killed by atom bomb. We have never recovered from the memory of that day. It is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible. This-a picture shows the prane that dropped the bomb.  It was called the Enora Gay. And it was frown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day. Dohfin, and Weiru! 
"
Stan,"Ummm, where did you get that picture?
"
Emperor Akihito,"The Americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing. We were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with America. We will never forgive, never rest until they are all wiped out! Fuck you. Fuck you dohfin and-a weiru!
"
Cartman,"So that's what this has all been about?
"
Stan,"Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
"
Cartman,"Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
"
Stan,"Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
"
Kyle,"Hello? Stan?
"
Stan,"Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
"
Stan,"Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.
"
Emperor Akihito,"Chicken and-a cow? Chicken and-a cow?!
"
Hatoyama,"Chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as-a scapegoat?! This is outrage! 
"
The Japanese,"Fuck you cows!
"
The Japanese,"Teikara chickens!
"
Randy,"Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
"
Cartman,"Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
"
Stan,"Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
"
Kyle,"This... is exactly what I needed.
"
Kenny,"(Meee toooo.) 
"
Stan,"Aww! Not those guys again! 
"
Cartman,"God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 
"
Stan,"God! Shut up!
"
Cartman,"Piss off, you stupid assholes! 
"
Randy,"Isn't this great food?
"
Gerald,"You're so right about this place. It's wonderful.
"
Randy,"You know what's really interesting is that-  ...what's really interesting is that this place has a new owner, and that-
"
Father Maxi,"On this gorgeous day we bring these two together for the most important ta- 
"
Lead Biker,"Everybody's checking us out.
"
Biker 2,"Yeah, they think we're pretty cool.
"
Lead Biker,"Hooo! We were definitely turnin' some heads out there.
"
Biker 3,"Yeah!
"
Biker 2,"I was pullin' back on that throttle, and everybody was like, ""What is that?""
"
Biker 4,"Fer sure!
"
Biker 3,"Yeah.
"
Biker 5,"Hey- hey, nobody here is really paying attention to us.
"
Lead Biker,"That's weird.  Oh yeah, that's better.
"
Lead Biker,"All right let's head out. 
"
Cartman,"Excuse me. Excuse me! Hey assholes!  You guys know that everyone thinks you're total fags, right.
"
Lead Biker,"...What did you say?
"
Cartman,"You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
"
Biker 6,"...Hey man, we roll how we roll, and if people are annoyed or intimidated by it, that's too bad for them!
"
Biker 2,"Yeah! 
"
Cartman,"No no, no, nobody is intimidated, actually. Everyone realizes that people who are so needy for attention they need to dress up and be as loud as possible are you guys and sixteen-year-old girls! Just wanted to let you know, you're fuckin' fags. 
"
Biker 7,"Thah- that little boy just called us fags.
"
Biker 2,"Like he didn't think we were cool.
"
Biker 6,"But he's wrong. People don't think we're fags, do they?
"
Lead Biker,"'Course he's wrong! And anyway, nobody except that little freak would ever say something like it to our faces!
"
Other Bikers,"Yeah! Let's ride!  Let's go! Rev 'em up! 
"
Ike,"Fags! 
"
Biker 2,"Did that kid just call us-?
"
Lead Biker,"Ju-just ignore him!  God damn it, this is fucked up!
"
Biker 8,"What's wrong with kids today? 
"
Biker 4,"It doesn't make any sense. They all called us fags.
"
Biker 6,"How can they call us fags? I mean, listen to this? 
"
Lead Biker,"I know, I know! Look, guys, I think I know what the problem is here.
"
Biker 3,"Really? You do?
"
Biker 9,"Whatwhat?
"
Lead Biker,"Yeah, think about it, guys. You see all the things kids have today? I mean, with their Xboxes and surround-sound entertainment systems, kids today are surrounded by big loud stuff all the time!
"
Biker 10,"Hey, that's right.
"
Lead Biker,"That's all it is, guys. We just need to get a little louder, that's all. 
"
Kyle,"Broflovski looks for Kenny to get clear for the pass.
"
Cartman,"But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 
"
Kyle,"Oh, what the hell?! 
"
Biker 6,"Chicken spears! Chicken spears! Chicken spears! ...Chicken spears! Chicken spears!
"
Stan,"God damn it God damn it!
"
Lead Biker,"Oh yeah, now we're turnin' some heads! 
"
Biker 2,"Let's see 'em call us fags now!
"
Stan,"All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
"
Kyle,"Yes.
"
Cartman,"Agreed.
"
Jimmy,"I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.
"
Stan,"Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
"
Kyle,"Sounds good.
"
Token,"Okay good, yeah.
"
Cartman,"Ni-nice, okay.
"
Butters,"What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Butters,"I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! ""Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!"" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
"
Stan,"...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
"
Butters,"It does?
"
Stan,"Yes, now get out of here.
"
Butters,"Okay. 
"
Stan,"Alright, Kyle and I are gonna spray paint messages to the Harley riders; Cartman, you said you had an idea?
"
Cartman,"I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
"
Stan,"Oh that's good.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I think that'll be nice.
"
Stan,"But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
"
Cartman,"I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
"
Stan,"Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
"
All,"Yeah!
"
Lead Biker,"Now that was a good breakfast.
"
Biker 6,"I'm full. 
"
Lead Biker,"You guys smell that? Smells like that new famous bowl at KFC
"
Biker 6,"Ohh, OHHH! Somebody took a shit on mah fuckin' Harley!
"
Biker 3,"What?
"
Biker 2,"Awwww, me too! I got shit all over my pants now! 
"
Biker 7,"There's a little flag stuck in the shit!
"
Biker 11,"""You're fags."" You've gotta be kidding me!
"
Lead Biker,"Come on, we'll find the bastards who did this! 
"
Biker 12,"This can't be happening. 
"
Stan,"Really nice work, guys.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
"
Big Gay Al,"And so I said to the guy, ""you really think I'm paying that much?""
"
Mr. Slave,"Heheh, oh Jesus Christ. 
"
Big Gay Al,"Oh my God. I thought we were past this.
"
Mayor McDaniels,"Students, I am here because of a very serious matter. This morning it was discovered that in several places all over town, somebody had spray-painted the words, ""Fags get out."" Many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint. Now, if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this, you must come forward-
"
Cartman,"That was us!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"...'Scuse me?
"
Stan,"Yeah, we did that!
"
"Kyle, Kenny","Yeah!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"...Why would you write something like that and be proud of it?!
"
Kyle,"W-well, 'cause we want all of those fags to get out of town.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
"
Other Kids,"Yeah, uh huh, I do, yep. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!
"
Stan,"Gay people?
"
Kyle,"We aren't talking about gay people.
"
Mr. Mackey,"You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!
"
Stan,"Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
"
Cartman,"Oh, they think we meant gay fags.
"
Kyle,"Oh. Hey, that's not very nice, Mayor. Just because a person is gay doesn't mean he's a fag.
"
Mayor McDaniels,"What?! You four boys, in my office, NOW!
"
Stan,"Aw crap!
"
Lead Biker,"Faggot, often shortened to fag, has been used in the English language since the late sixteenth century. Its original meaning was ""an old or unpleasant woman"".
"
Biker 2,"That certainly don't apply to us.
"
Lead Biker,"Faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks. And in the nineteenth century, a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood.
"
Biker 6,"Well they certainly ain't calling us fags 'cause we gather sticks; there's got to be more! 
"
Biker 2,"What's that part say there?
"
Lead Biker,"Later, the term ""fag"" was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried, and was often used as an insult to the elderly, as in calling them ""baggage"".
"
Biker 2,"Fag was used as an insult to women, then poor people, then old people?
"
Lead Biker,"In the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the United States.
"
Biker 10,"Well that word just keeps changing its meaning. What's it got to do with us? 
"
Judge 1,"We are really trying to understand this. How is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in today's world is acceptable?
"
Kyle,"Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
"
Stan,"Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.
"
Judge 2,"I happen to be gay, boys. Do you think I'm a fag?
"
Stan,"Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
"
Judge 2,"No.
"
Stan,"Then you're not a fag.
"
Judge 1,"So what if a guy is gay and rides a Harley?
"
Cartman,"Then he's a gay fag. I mean, is this really this hard?
"
Stan,"I don't know.
"
Kenny,"(This is fucking ridiculous.)
"
Stan,"All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
"
Judge 3,"""Fag.""
"
Stan,"Right. But you're not thinkin' ""Oh, he's a homosexual,"" you're thinkin' ""Oh, he's an inconsiderate douchebag like a Harley rider.""
"
Judge 1,"This, this is, making insanely good sense to me.
"
Judge 4,"Alright, how about this: What would you call a straight man who doesn't own a Harley, but likes them and might buy one someday?
"
Cartman,"You call them ""bike-curious"".
"
Judge 1,"""Bike-cu-""
"
Stan,"""Bike-curious""! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
"
Kenny,"(Jesus fucking Christ!)
"
Big Gay Al,"Fellow homosexuals, I believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind. We must acknowledge that the words ""fag"" and ""faggot"" are never going to disappear. They're simply too much fun for everyone to say. But we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet, and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot Harley riders!
"
Mr. Slave,"Hear hear!
"
Big Gay Al,"We should all be tolerant, but not with these fucking people! They really are faggots!
"
Mr. Slave,"Yeth Jethuth yeth!
"
Announcer,"This is Channel 4 Evening News.
"
News Anchor,"A new movement in South Park is bringing to question the word ""fag"". Gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago.
"
Field Reporter,"And what is your name, little boy?
"
Martin,"Martin.
"
Field Reporter,"Alright Martin, can you do me a favor? Could you point to the ""fag"" for me?  Point to which one is the fag.  All right now could you just point to the fag for me, little girl? Which one is a faggot? 
"
News Anchor,"Sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group, the Mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word ""fag"" officially refer to annoying inconsiderate Harley riders. 
"
Field Reporter,"How do you fags feel about the new city ordinance?
"
Lead Biker,"What did you say?
"
Field Reporter,"Just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance, fag.
"
Lead Biker,"Hey you know what? If you call me fag in my face one more time, you'd better-
"
Field Reporter,"I already did it twice.
"
Lead Biker,"Well I think that- I think that you uh, you probably won't say it again.
"
Field Reporter,"I bet I do.
"
Lead Biker,"Well okay, I-
"
Field Reporter,"Fag. 
"
News Anchor,"As more people in South Park adapt to the new meaning... 
"
Randy,"Fags! 
"
News Anchor,"...more and more Harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere.
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 
"
Stan,"Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
"
Kyle,"I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
"
Mayor McDaniels,"You four turd balls in my office NOW!
"
Stan,"Aw crap! 
"
Mayor McDaniels,"You have got me in a lot of trouble! 
"
Another Mayor,"The fact of the matter is that ""fag"" is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals, and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not! The town of South Park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"She's gaining support all over the country. I should have never listened to you!
"
Kyle,"We're sorry, Mayor.
"
Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, that's nice! You made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes, but at least you're sorry!
"
Stan,"We can fix this!
"
Mayor McDaniels,"HOW?!
"
Stan,"That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
"
Cartman,"Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
"
Lead Biker,"Now I don't know about you, but I think this town is starting a trend. And if we let them officially change the meaning of ""fag"" from gay people to us, then soon every town might.  If we don't do anythng, we can end up trying to fight e-  If we don't do anything, we c-... Hey Bartlett. Bartlett!  I'm trying to talk, you fag!  Aw, see? Now they got us doin' it to ourselves! We gotta put a stop to this now!  We're going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin' ass! 
"
Field Reporter,"Excitement is in the air as the citizens of South Park amass to see if the word ""fag"" will officially be changed in the English dictionary. Four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor, and if they succeed, ""fag"" will officially refer to Harley riders nationwide.
"
Big Gay Al,"You can do it, boys! We believe in you!
"
Field Reporter,"And Tom, it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived.  Entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course, the dictionary's head editor, Mr. Emmanuel Lewis. 
"
Cartman,"Emmanuel Lewis, huh?
"
Stan,"Ohh, it all makes sense now. 
"
Emmanuel Lewis,"To change...  the definition of a word... is no trifling thing. I expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word ""fag"" to be both discerning and undisputable.
"
Big Gay Al,"Come on boys, you can do it! 
"
Randy,"Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 
"
Stan,"There's fags everywhere!
"
Kyle,"We gotta run! 
"
Emmanuel Lewis,"WAAAH! What nefariousness is this?! Ogh! You obdurate beast! 
"
Lead Biker,"Well well. Now, do you think we're fags?
"
Stan,"Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah. You definitely made your point.
"
Biker 13,"No! We rolled in, kicked ass, and took shit over! Is that what a fag does?!
"
Stan,"Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
"
Lead Biker,"No, you're supposed to think we're not fags now!
"
Stan,"But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
"
Kyle,"I don't either.
"
Butters,"That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
"
Biker 14,"Who is this little fag?
"
Butters,"I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
"
Biker 15,"That's it, let's kill them all!
"
Cartman,"No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
"
Big Gay Al,"No one is killing anyone!  We've had enough! You faggots get the hell out of our town!
"
Lead Biker,"All right everyone, all right. We are fags. Yeah, we're fags. We're total fags. And yo know what? We like it.
"
Biker 2,"Yeah, we like being fags.
"
Lead Biker,"So go ahead, America. Whenever you pass by Harley riders like us, roll down your window, and yell ""Faggots!"" All you kids out there, when you see us, walk up to us, and say ""Hello, fags."" No, really, we want you to. At least we're cool enough to embrace who we are. Right guys?
"
Bikers,"That's right. You got it. Yeah. 
"
Biker 6,"Come on, fags, let's roll out! 
"
Stan,"...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
"
Emmanuel Lewis,"Let there be no perplexity: those individuals are the legitimate faggots. The definition shall be replaced. 
"
Stan,"We did it! Yeah!
"
Kyle,"Yeah! We did it, you guys! 
"
Cartman,"Oh it's over, it's finally over! 
"
Stan,"Today, we've made history.
"
Student,"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements, Parent-teacher conferences begin next Thursday.

Intruder,"I'm the man who's gonna put a bullet between your eyes!
"
Student,"Hey! He's got a gun!
"
Intruder,"You little bastard! You fucked my wife! You think I wouldn't find out?!
"
Student,"Sir, please, I don't know you.
"
Intruder,"Yeah, right!
"
Man,"All right, what the hell is going on around here? You sir need to leave this area- 
"
Student,"Oh God, he shot him!
"
Intruder,"Ya had to push me, didn't ya?! NOW YOU!
"
Student,"HAAAAAAAAAA! Sir, I clearly don't know-  th-AAAAA! AAAA!
"
Intruder,"There! How's it feel, huh?!
"
Student,"Please, I don't know you! Uughuh!
"
Intruder,"You're Gordon Stoltski, right?! Truck driver from Chicago?!
"
Gordon,"No, I'm Gordon Stoltski, third grader who reads the morning announcements!
"
Intruder,"Yeah, right! We'll see if that's true. Go on, read the morning announcements!
"
Gordon,"SOMEBODY HELP ME!
"
Intruder,"I said do it! 
"
Gordon,"AAAAA! AAAAA! AAAAAAAAAA! AAA! Any, any interested students should fill out an applicant survey  WAA! WAAAAAAAAAA!
"
Intruder,"I knew you were lyin'! That was terrible! Now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun!
"
Gordon,"No please! I'm so scared!   I'm so scared!
"
Intruder,"DO IT!
"
Gordon,"Please! I'll duh, I'll do whatever you say! Here! Here I see! Here!  I got my mouth on the ba- 
"
Intruder,"Look at you now. We're all dead. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
"
Cartman,"Oh. My. Goodddd.
"
Cartman,"Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
"
Boy,"Yeah, I think it would be really fu-fu-fu-fun, and ru-ru-ru-rurrraise my self es-es-esesesteem.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 
"
Cartman,"He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?
"
Casey,"My name is Casey Miller, and I'm in the third grade.  Ever since I can remember people have told me I should read their morning announcements. My friends always said to me, ""Dear Casey, your voice is like butter to our ears. Could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves?"" Well, here I am, and hopefully I'll be the kid with the job. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?
"
Casey,"I'm tryin' out and dryin' out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice.
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Eric, you wanna go next? 
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay Eric, I'm just gonna have you read this piece of paper.
"
Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?
"
Mr. Mackey,"What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
"
Cartman,"Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Get lost, you little dirtball!
"
Casey,"Excuse me?
"
Mr. Mackey,"I said take a hike!
"
Casey,"I don't understand... what I did wrong.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! 
"
Cartman,"Good morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. And I, am Eric Cartman. All forms for the school book drive must be handed it to Mr. Davis in the library by the end of the school day today. Hm, doesn't seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that, uh, 'kay. Oh well.  For lunch today, the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches. Cold sandwiches. Oh well, thank you so much! Remember when we used to be served hot food? I mean, what has happened to our school? This school is transforming into something very bad, and why? Because we have leadership that doesn't care! I'm talking of course about our student body president, Wendy Testaburger!  Ever since Wendy was elected student body president, this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice! The music room will be closed off today due to painting. All students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead. Oh oh, so now, so now the school is using money to paint the music room. How old and outdated is our playground equipment? What other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it? Our school president is turning this whole place into Communist Russia!  It's not a coincidence that once Wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams! Your teachers don't wanna tell you, but they are scared, and they should be, because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners.
"
Butters,"Oh jeez!
"
Cartman,"But hey, I'm just a normal kid, like you, except that I ask questions. And because I'm brave enough to ask questions, I come under scrutinies. Is Wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin? Probably not, but how can we know? I don't want my lunch money going to drugs! Who's taking these drugs? What would be the point? I'm asking questions!
"
Kyle,"Will somebody shut him up?
"
Cartman,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
"
Principal Victoria,"The job is to read what is written on the paper, Eric, not to embellish the way you do.
"
Cartman,"Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
"
Principal Victoria,"No, it's just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work.
"
Cartman,"Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well, because he was being murdered.
"
Cartman,"You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
"
Principal Victoria,"All we ask is you keep it shorter.
"
Cartman,"Oh I will! And maybe I'll also have a word with the ACLU, tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school! I'm sure they'll find that very interesting!
"
Cartman,"Well. Goood morning South Park Elementary. These are the morning announcements. Tryouts for the soccer team are on Friday afternoon. That is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field.  I have a question. What does Wendy Testaburger actually do? She is supposed to be the president, right? What is her agenda? She's lying to everyone? Or is she? Let's ask these questions.  Today I wanna talk briefly about the state of our school's economy. The bake sale last week was a complete failure. And in the school-  And besides that, who actually voted for Wendy Testaburger? I know I didn't. And everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin' ""Whoops. Guess I shouldn't have done that.""  I'm not in the student council, I'm just a normal kid like all of you. And like all of you, I want to know what has happened... to my school.
"
Third Graders,"I pledge allegiance to the flag -
"
Cartman,"- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
"
Kindergartners,"- a socialist dunghole...
"
Cartman,"Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
"
Kyle,"Oh God, no! 
"
Cartman,"Lunch today is going to be pizza. Again.  Friends, our school is dying and you know it. You feel it. You're like, you're like me; you wanna change it. But ohhh no, Wendy Testaburger's not gonna let that happen! This is not the school we grew up in, and ...and I don't know if we can get it back.  So let's take a look at exactly what our school president wants. You know, what is she trying to achieve? Let's just take a look at these Keywords here: Wendy's made it clear she wants our school to be a more Integrated Leftist and Liberal place! But you see what then happens, what we get is a Socialist, Modern, Utopian, Reformed, Farce of a School. So when you look closely it becomes very obvious what Wendy wants. K I L L S M U R F S. Our school president ...wants to kill Smurfs.
"
Ike,"NOOO!
"
Cartman,"I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.
"
Butters,"Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
"
Wendy,"Is what true?
"
Butters,"That you hate Smurfs?
"
Wendy,"I don't have time for this.
"
Butters,"Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
"
Melvins,"Yeah, that's right. We can ask. 
"
Wendy,"Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
"
Butters,"It is true!
"
Melvin 1,"Oh my God!
"
Melvin 2,"Yeah, bemememe
"
Melvin 3,"Oh my God!
"
Wendy,"Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 
"
Butters,"What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
"
Casey,"Hyeah.
"
Melvin 1,"That was cool.
"
Melvin 4,"Awesome
"
Melvin 2,"Yeah, that was cool.
"
Melvin 3,"Yeah, great job.
"
Cartman,"""Thank you"" and this is to..?
"
Douglas,"Douglas.
"
Cartman,"""To Douglas."" There you go.  Book signing today everyone, be sure to pick up your copy.
"
Butters,"Hey Eric!
"
Cartman,"Well hello. Another person who  cares about the future of our school?
"
Butters,"Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
"
Cartman,"Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
"
Butters,"Cool, thanks.
"
Cartman,"That'll be five dollars.
"
Butters,"Oh, okay. 
"
Stan,"What the hell do you think you're doing?!
"
Cartman,"A book signing.
"
Stan,"I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
"
Cartman,"I do not directly say she's a slut!
"
Stan,"""Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end""!
"
Cartman,"You didn't read the rest, dude.
"
Stan,"""Or does she?""
"
Cartman,"""Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
"
Butters,"Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!
"
Boy 1,"""Shouldn't we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings?"" 
"
Stan,"Hey hey, stop reading that!
"
Boy 1,"Wull what do you mean?
"
Stan,"Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
"
Boy 2,"Yes it does!
"
Casey,"Eric Cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders. We should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina. I'm Casey Miller. 
"
Stan,"Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
"
Wendy,"I really don't care, Stan.
"
Stan,"Well don't you think you should go on his show and defend yourself?! Everyone is starting to think you're a crappy president.
"
Wendy,"I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 
"
Cartman,"You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric, we've been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school.
"
Cartman,"Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
"
Cartman,"And what if they are?! You'll stop me from asking just because Wendy forces you to?!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
"
Cartman,"Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric, I've had enough! You cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds! Do I make myself clear?!
"
Cartman,"Clear as summer rain! Clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water! This school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isn't free! Well I'm not gonna be a part of it, do you understand?! I'm leaving this... hypocritical Communist school! i'm walking out and I'm never coming back! 
"
Announcer,"Live, from the principal's office, these are the morning announcements. Here, is Eric Cartman.
"
Cartman,"Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
"
Butters,"Whoa... 
"
Cartman,"The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
"
Kyle,"""These, are the morning announcements."" 
"
Cartman,"Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
"
Cartman Smurf,"No! No, you must leave the noble Smurfs alone! Who's behind all this?!  I should have known. Wendy!
"
Human Wendy,"Out of my way! 
"
Cartman Smurf,"Wendy, what are you doing here?!
"
Human Wendy,"Smurfberries are worth a lot of money. With all those Smurfberries I can power the school for the entire year.
"
Cartman Smurf,"Wendy, I know you're president of our school, but you can't just dig up the Smurfs' land!
"
Human Wendy,"Fuck the Smurfs! They can suck my fat tits! 
"
Cartman Smurf,"How many Smurfberries is enough, Wendy?!
"
Human Wendy,"You can suck my fat tits too! 
"
Cartman Smurf,"Smurfette noooo!
"
Human Wendy,"Suck mah fat tits!
"
Cartman,"And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
"
Butters,"That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
"
A Melvin,"I can no longer stand idly by.
"
Butters,"We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
"
Casey,"It is time for that slutty Smurf-killing bitch to get what's comin' to 'er.
"
Melvins,"Yeah!
"
Butters,"I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
"
Butters,"Let us not forget what happens this day!
"
A Melvin,"Woo on!
"
Butters,"We are here, Wendy Testaburger! 
"
Melvin 2,"Take that, school president!
"
Melvin 3,"Get her good!
"
Butters,"I am.
"
Wendy,"Hey, what are you doing?
"
Butters,"The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
"
Mr. Testaburger,"What the hell? 
"
Butters,"Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
"
Mr. Testaburger,"Wendy, did a boy just pee on our door because the Smurfs were murdered? 
"
Wendy,"It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
"
Cartman,"Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
"
Wendy,"Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.
"
Cartman,"People are riled up. Hopefully we can clear the air here this morning.
"
Wendy,"If we could just keep it to questions about Student Council?
"
Cartman,"Of course. That's why we're here.
"
A Boy,"Five seconds. 
"
Cartman,"Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
"
Wendy,"Sure.
"
Cartman,"Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
"
Wendy,"Okay.
"
Cartman,"How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 
"
Wendy,"I don't, I, I have no idea what-
"
Cartman,"You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
"
Butters,"Ohhh, he's got her now!
"
Cartman,"Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
"
Wendy,"I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
"
Cartman,"If a Smurf dies and no one is around to hear it, does it still scream? 
"
Butters,"She's speechless!
"
Cartman,"You are the president of the school. Can you see why many students think you're an ineffective slut? Are you denying that the Smurf holocaust ever happened? Is that what you're suggesting?
"
Wendy,"Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
"
Cartman,"Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
"
Wendy,"What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
"
Cartman,"What? What do you mean I know that?
"
Wendy,"I'm just asking a question. We all knew you were sent in to live with the Smurfs, but did you know they would be wiped out?
"
Cartman,"No! You wiped them all out!
"
Wendy,"Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
"
Cartman,"Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
"
Wendy,"No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.
"
Stan,"What?!
"
Wendy,"And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
"
Butters,"All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
"
A Melvin,"I'm confused.
"
Cartman,"Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
"
Wendy,"No, you're right. The students all deserve to know the truth. And so I have answered what really happened in my new book, Going Rogue on the Smurfs.
"
Cartman,"No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
"
Wendy,"Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
"
Cartman,"You sold the movie rights to who?!
"
Wendy,"James Cameron. Go look. The movie came out already.
"
Cartman,"Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
"
Cartman,"Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 
"
Cartman,"Huh!
"
Stan,"Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
"
Cartman,"No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
"
Kyle,"Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
"
Cartman,"I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 
"
Casey,"The sun is up and the birds are chirping. I'm Casey Miller and these, are the morning announcements. I have a letter from second-grade student Brian Falner. Brian writes, ""Dear Casey, why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead? My desk is broken, and so far Eric Cartman has done nothing about it. Will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy?"" Well Brian, I couldn't agree more. Our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake.
"
Cartman,"I'm doin' the best I can! 
"
Cartman,"We're going to the water park,
The water park, the water park.
We're going to the water park,
Me and my best friends, except for Kyle who I don't like.
"
Stan,"Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. 
"
Cartman,"This is gonna be sooo awesome dude. I haven't been to the water park in like, over a year.
"
Butters,"What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
"
Cartman,"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
"
Jimmy,"Wha-what are you talking about, Eric?
"
Cartman,"You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
"
Stan,"We're here! It's the water park! 
"
Randy,"I'm gonna pick you boys up right here at four o'clock, you got it?
"
Cartman,"Come on, let's go!
"
Stan,"We got it, Dad.
"
Cartman,"Six adorable children please.
"
Cartman,"Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 
"
Kyle,"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
"
Stan,"Well Cartman said he wanted to do the wave pool first, right Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Forget it! Just forget it! 
"
Stan,"Dude, this is awesome.
"
Kyle,"You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
"
Butters,"Hey fellers, fellas hang on. I've gotta go to the bathroom. 
"
Kyle,"Okay, go ahead. 
"
Butters,"Okay, thanks. 
"
Kyle,"I can seriously hold my breath longer than anybody. Somebody time me, all right?
"
Stan,"Okay.
"
Kyle,"All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
"
Butters,"You said ""go ahead"".
"
Stan,"Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
"
Kyle,"No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
"
Stan,"Aw come on, look at all this water. It doesn't matter if one person pees in it.
"
Butters,"Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
"
Kyle,"No they don't!
"
Stan,"Yeah, they do, Kyle.
"
Jimmy,"To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago.
"
Kyle,"Dude!
"
Stan,"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
"
Kyle,"NO!
"
Cartman,"What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
"
Ride operator,"Guarden los brazos y piernas dentro del paseo-
"
Cartman,"Just do it in English!
"
Cartman,"There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).
"
Stan,"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
"
Butters,"You bet!
"
Kyle,"I'm not getting back in the water.
"
Stan,"Aw come on, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Dude, I just found out that everybody pees in pools. Why would I go back?
"
Stan,"Not everybody pees in pools.
"
Kyle,"Do you pee in the pool?
"
Stan,"Not today... yet.
"
Kyle,"Aw, come on!
"
Stan,"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
"
Kyle,"Most likely.
"
Cartman,"You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
"
Stan,"Dude, where have you been?
"
Cartman,"I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
"
Kyle,"So what?
"
Cartman,"So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
"
Kyle,"Well then they're not minorities, are they?
"
Cartman,"...What do you mean?
"
Kyle,"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
"
Cartman,"The black and brown people.
"
Kyle,"No, you're the minority!
"
Cartman,"Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!
"
Stan,"This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
"
Cartman,"Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
"
Butters,"The who?
"
Cartman,"The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
"
Stan,"I'm gonna go on the slides.
"
Butters,"Whoopie! 
"
Cartman,"You guys! You guys have to do something to stop this! Come on!  Well, looks like at least you've got some sense left in you, Kyle. So what are we gonna do to keep the Mayan prediction from coming true, buddy?
"
Kyle,"Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 
"
Elderly Woman,"Eugene, that is disgusting! Did you just pee in the pool?
"
Elderly Man,"Aw, come on, look how big this pool is. One person peeing in it isn't gonna hurt anything.
"
Kyle,"Eewww! 
"
Water Tester,"Oh my God.
"
Pi Pi,"Ah, gentlemen, I am da Pi Pi. How can I heelp you.
"
Assistant,"Pi Pi, we have some dire news concerning your water park.
"
Water Tester,"I've just finished some tests. The water in your park is now ninety eight percent pee.
"
Pi Pi,"Yes, uhso whatsuh is the problem?
"
Assistant,"Pi Pi, you know that acceptable pee levels in any water park is eighty three percent.  You have to shut down.
"
Pi Pi,"What?! I can'tuh close down now, it'she my biggesteh weekend. Everyone is having uhtheh fun.
"
Water Tester,"You're endangering people's lives!  If those pee levels hit a hundred percent, there's no telling what'll happen!
"
Lawyer,"And what proof... do you have that the pee levels will go up?
"
Water Tester,"One in three people admit they pee in pools. Add another for people who do but don't admit it; that's two in three. You've got just over five hundred people out there; that's three hundred and thirty two people about to pee in your water!
"
Pi Pi,"Gehntlemen, pleaseh. I come-a from ada Venice.  Venice is almost all pee. And we doin' just fine. We swim-a in the pee, we sing-a in the pee. You can't barge in here and tell me thuh, that I have to close down just because my wahter park has-a too much pee.
"
Water Tester,"You have to evacuate people now!
"
Lawyer,"He said he's not doing it! And as his lawyer I advise you gentlemen to leave and take your wild pee theories with you!
"
Water Tester,"If one more person urinates in your pool, it could set off a chain reaction. Then the pee will be on your hands. 
"
Butters,"Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
"
Stan,"This is sweet, huh Kenny? 
"
Jimmy,"What what's that? 
"
Man 1,"It's pee! 
"
Man 2,"Look out for the pee! 
"
Kyle,"Aaaaah! Gross! 
"
Pi Pi,"Aaaaa, it's-a the peeee! 
"
Floating Man,"Aaaah!
"
Stan,"Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
Kyle,"Aw, sick! 
"
Fire Marshal,"I want that entire water park contained and quarantined until I get some answers. 
"
Randy,"What's going on?
"
Fire Marshal,"I told you people to keep civilians back!
"
Randy,"Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
"
Fire Marshal,"We don't know yet, all right?! There's been a pee breach and a lot of people are dead. Now I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to-
"
Officer 1,"Captain, these two men claim to know the situation. 
"
Water Tester,"We warned the owner of the park, but he refused to shut down. This was inevitable.
"
Fire Marshal,"So this is all pee-related.
"
Water Tester,"Yes, I... tested the pH levels this morning.
"
Fire Marshal,"And?
"
Water Tester,"It was almost all pee, no H.
"
Randy,"Oh my God. I've gotta help him! 
"
Fire Marshal,"Stay back!
"
Randy,"You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
"
Officer 2,"Sir, it's possible with the crane we could help any survivors out.
"
Water Tester,"I think that would be a very bad idea.
"
Fire Marshal,"And why is that?
"
Water Tester,"Anyone inside there is contaminated. We have reason to believe that when people are exposed to that much pee, they... change.
"
Fireman 1,"Change how?
"
Water Tester,"All right uh brubring in, bring in the monkey.  We've only tested the theory on monkeys so far. This monkey is healthy and normal in every way, but now, watch. 
"
Fire Marshal,"My God, he's become full of rage!
"
Kyle,"Aahhh...
"
Stan,"Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
"
Kyle,"No way!
"
Jimmy,"You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.
"
Butters,"Come on, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Dude, that's all pee!
"
Stan,"Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
"
Kyle,"I'll die if I do swim in it!
"
Stan,"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
"
Kyle,"Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
"
Stan,"...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
"
Kyle,"...What?!
"
Stan,"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
"
Kyle,"You don't wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
"
Stan,"Not... all the time.
"
Kyle,"That is gross!!
"
Stan,"Why? It's not like you're peeing on your hands! There's more germs on most furniture than there is in pee!
"
Butters,"Yeah, if anything you should wash your hands before you touch your weiner! 
"
Stan,"Kyle, come on!
"
Kyle,"Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
"
Butters,"Do you need to wash your hands?
"
Cartman,"Help! Help!
"
Man 1,"Here! Hey kid, grab this stick! 
"
Cartman,"Yes! Yes help me! Yes, help me I'm just a little boy! You have to help me!  Oh, oh, oh. 
"
Man 2,"Are you okay?
"
Cartman,"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
"
Man 2,"Well what are we gonna do now?
"
Woman 1,"We've gotta just wait it out.
"
Woman 2,"Yeah, but for how long?
"
Man 3,"We need to find somethin' to paddle with.
"
Cartman,"Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 
"
Sharon,"Randy, Randy, calm down. I can't understand what you're saying.
"
Randy,"It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
"
Sharon,"What is all pee?
"
Randy,"Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
"
Sharon,"What?! What about Stan?! Is he okay?!
"
Randy,"I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
"
Sharon,"Randy, you've got to do something!
"
Randy,"Calm down, Sharon, all right?!  Calm down! They're trying to find an antidote. Once they believe they can neutralize the enraging effects of the pee, they'll, they'll go in to look for survivors.
"
Fire Marshal,"I said keep the media out! If the public hears about this we'll have a full-scale panic on our hands!  Damn it where is that antidote?!
"
Researcher 1,"Here! Here! We think we have it, sir!  It's the best we could come up with in such a short time! We aren't sure of the ramifications, but it does appear to neutralize some particles of the urine.
"
Fire Marshal,"All right, let's test it. Bring in the monkeys! 
"
Water Tester,"Let's hope to Christ this works.  No, damn it, no!
"
Fire Marshal,"They're still angry.
"
Researcher 1,"This one's really angry.
"
Fire Marshal,"It's out of control!  Find an antidote that works! 
"
Kyle,"Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
"
Stan,"I don't know. 
"
Pi Pi,"Why? Why didn't Pi Pi leesten? They tried to warn-a the Pi Pi, but-a the Pi Pi not-a belieeve them. 
"
Stan,"Who are you?
"
Pi Pi,"Oh I, I'm so sohhry. This all-eh my fault. I should've-a shut my water park-a down when it reached-a ninety percent-a pee.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
"
Pi Pi,"But wait-a. Maybe you boys-a can help-a Pi Pi. In-a the maintenance room-a there's the emergency release-a valve-a. If you open the door then the pee can be lowered.
"
Jimmy,"Okay, w-where's the maintenance room?
"
Pi Pi,"That is-a the problem. The maintenance room is a way down on the basement-a level. I would do it but-a Pi Pi is-a no good at-a swimming. Somebody will have to dive-a down into the pee, then stay there to turn the release-a wheel. So, who can hold their breath-a the longest? 
"
Kyle,"No.
"
Butters,"You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Not in pee!
"
Pi Pi,"Please-a you have to hurry!  I'll draw you-a the map, and instructions how to shut off-a the valve-a. It'll be as easy as-a peeing in the shower.
"
Kyle,"Oh who pees in the shower?
"
Stan,"...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
"
Butters,"Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
"
Kyle,"You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
"
Pi Pi,"Boys-a please-a, we've got to get this-a boy to the drainage-a valve-a or we're all-a gonna die!
"
Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
Cartman,"It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 
"
Teacher,"All right, Eric Cartman, let's hear your book report.
"
Cartman,"I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
"
Teacher,"Hey! You're living in a minority-speaking country now! Say it right!
"
Cartman,"...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
"
Teacher,"Good.
"
Cartman,"Noooo...  Trying to find a job will be even harder.
"
Señor Lopez,"You don't expect to make the same amount of money that minorities make, do ya?
"
Cartman,"Well, I do just as much work.
"
Señor Lopez,"You're trash around here. You'll never make as much as a minority.
"
Cartman,"Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
"
Coucilman,"All those in favor of putting white people in camps?
"
Audience,"Aye!
"
Coucilman,"All those opposed?
"
Cartman,"Noooo...
"
Coucilman,"The minorities win! 
"
Cartman,"NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 
"
Pi Pi,"Okay, there. We are almost-a ready for the diving-a. Now if you run into any da problems you just tug-a three times on the cable and the Pi Pi will-a pull you back-a to the surface.
"
Kyle,"Let's just get this over with!
"
Pi Pi,"You've got-a the map and-a Pi Pi's instructions?
"
Kyle,"Yes.
"
Pi Pi,"Good-a. Now just one last thing.  You need to drink-a some pee.
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Pi Pi,"You just need to drink about-a three cups of pee.
"
Kyle,"Why?!
"
Pi Pi,"You swim-a down deep in the pee, you get-a the pressure, the bendza. You have to fill-a inside your body with some-a pee to compensate.
"
Stan,"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
"
Kyle,"I am not, not, d-rinking pee!
"
Pi Pi,"But only you can hold-a the breath a long time, just swim down and-a release the valve! If-eh you don't you get-a the benza, then you fail and we all-a die!
"
Stan,"Just drink the pee, Kyle.
"
Butters,"Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
"
Pi Pi,"What's-a the problem? When-a you pee either in the toilet or in the shower it all goes to the sewer. The sewer all goes-a to the ocean, the ocean is the water we all drink, we are always drinking-a the pee!
"
Kyle,"That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
"
Pi Pi,"Sure you will, you drank only pee for nine months when you lived-a in your mother's belly.
"
Kyle,"No!
"
Water Tester,"Make way! Make way! I need to speak to the fire marshal! Sir! Sir, I just got off the phone with my colleagues at the university! They've also been testing antidotes on monkeys! They're claiming that they've had success using simple Musa acuminata.
"
Researcher 2,"Wait, you mean a banana.
"
Water Tester,"Yes.
"
Fire Marshal,"Is it possible... the antidote is something as simple as a banana? Get another monkey!  All right, Connors. 
"
Fireman 2,"Holy God, it works!
"
Police Captain,"All right, let's start moving in, everyone! Check the-
"
Water Tester,"Hold on, ih it is a promising lead, but this antidote hasn't yet been tested on a human.
"
Randy,"I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 
"
Fire Marshal,"You sure you want to do this?
"
Randy,"Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
"
Researcher 3,"He looks agitated...
"
Randy,"Aaaaaahhh. Aw, awww.
"
Fire Marshal,"He's losin' it! Stevens, your gun! 
"
Randy,"No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
"
Water Tester,"He's all right!
"
Fireman 3,"The banana worked!
"
Stan,"Come on, dude!
"
Kyle,"I'm thinking about it!
"
Jimmy,"Well it's probably bu-better if you don't think about it, Kyle.
"
Pi Pi,"There's no more time-a. You have to drink-a the pee NOW! 
"
Kyle,"Gah, ah.  Gaagh.
"
Pi Pi,"Come on, you have to drink aaall-a the peeeee.
"
Butters,"You can do it, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 
"
Pi Pi,"All right, now you can open the release-a valve. Okay, so let's-a 
"
Butters,"Hey look! 
"
Randy,"Stan! 
"
Stan,"All right, they finally came for us. 
"
Kyle,"Are you fucking kidding me?! 
"
Randy,"Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
"
Cartman,"Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!
"
Butters,"Hawww, you lived?
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
"
Kyle,"That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
"
Cartman,"It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
"
Kyle,"Will somebody just get me to a hospital? I need to get my stomach pumped!
"
Stan,"Aw come on, it was just a little pee, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Goddamnit, don't you get it?! I hate pee! I'm grossed out by pee! The only thing I find more disgusting than pee is bananas!
"
Water Tester,"All right everyone, quick! Here you go!
"
Butters,"What's this?
"
Fire Marshal,"You all need to eat your banana immediately!
"
Kyle,"What the hell for?!
"
Stevens,"Eat the banana or we have to put you down!
"
Kyle,"AAAAAAAA!
"
Character,Line
Man,"Put it down, you bitch!
"
Man,"Put the golf club down, you crazy bitch! 
"
Woman,"You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 
"
Tiger,"You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!
"
Elin,"Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?!
"
Tiger,"God, shut up!  Shut! Up!  Where are my fucking pills?! 
"
Elin,"Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!!
"
Tiger,"Will you just listen to me?!
"
Elin,"Listen to this-a! 
"
Tiger,"Aaaah!  You fucking whore!
"
Elin,"Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?!
"
Tiger,"I'm getting the fuck away from you! 
"
Elin,"Open the door, you motherfucker! 
"
Cartman,"Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
"
Stan,"What are you guys doing?
"
Cartman,"Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 
"
Tiger,"D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!
"
Cartman,"Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 
"
Tiger,"Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!
"
Elin,"It serves you right, you cheating turd! 
"
Cartman,"Oh dude, was that a combo move?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)
"
Cartman,"Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
"
Kyle,"Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
"
Cartman,"Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
"
Chairman,"I've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer. As you've all seen on the news, our country is facing a major crisis, and we need to find out what's causing it.  Why? Why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women?
"
Expert 1,"Tiger Woods was only the most prevalent, but our data shows that the numbers are growing. David Letterman and before that, Bill Clinton. There's a pattern here, people.
"
Expert 2,"Why would a man who's famous and makes tons of money use that and have sex with lots of different women? 
"
Chairman,"Aand these rich celebrities have perfectly good wives at home. Why would they even think of sex with others? Dammit!  I want answers!
"
Expert 3,"We believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction, sir.
"
Chairman,"Sex awhowho?
"
Expert 4,"It's a new phenomena we don't completely understand yet, but it... seems to make people... different. Of course, we all know the normal healthy male thinks only of sex occasionally and has no desire for sex with multiple partners. 
"
Expert 5,"Definitely true.
"
Chairman,"Yes, we all know that, go on.
"
Expert 4,"But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her.
"
Expert 6,"But what about love? How could tons of fame and money make you forget about love? 
"
Chairman,"What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction?
"
Expert 7,"It could be caused by something in the water supply. Uh, perhaps even by - global warming.
"
Expert 8,"Or cooling.
"
Expert 9,"Yes
"
Expert 7,"If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children
"
Chairman,"That does it!  I want health screening at all our nation's schools! We need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease.
"
Expert 9,"Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms.  I'n a moment, I'm going to show you a suggestive picture.  And then I'm going to ask you a question about that picture. Alright, ready? Here we go. 
"
The class,"Oh! Wow. Ohhh.
"
Kenny,"(Woo hoo!)
"
Kyle,"Jesus, dude.
"
Butters,"Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
"
Expert 9,"Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided.
"
Butters,"I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
"
Expert 9,"Okay, very good.  Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?
"
Butters,"Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
"
Expert 9,"Very good, turn your answers over please. 
"
Butters,"Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
"
Expert 9,"Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow?  Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered ""What handkerchief?""  A-ha! You three boys, please come with me. 
"
Kyle,"I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
"
Expert 9,"I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction.
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Butters,"Oh no!
"
Kenny,"(Who fuckin' cares?)
"
Expert 9,"We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid.
"
Kyle,"Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?
"
Expert 9,"Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students.
"
Butters,"It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
"
Kyle,"So what happens to us now?
"
Expert 9,"A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation.
"
Kenny,"(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)
"
Expert 9,"I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome.
"
Kenny,"(Really??)
"
Butters,"Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
"
Chairman,"Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton?
"
Dr. Tonton,"In fourth graders, five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts. By sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent. At high schools, nearly ninety-one percent of male students answered, ""What handkerchief?""
"
Chairman,"We're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country. Young people all over America are infected, and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them.  They're leading lives of secret pain.
"
Reporter 1,"And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people?
"
Chairman,"It appears so.
"
Reporter 1,"The poor bastards!
"
Reporter 2,"But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure?
"
Chairman,"We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities.  However, we are still collecting data, and all-
"
Randy,"Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
"
Chairman,"-answers which we all desire.  Whatever is causing this outbreak, we guarantee we will find it! 
"
Mrs. McCormick,"Kenny, it's time for dinner!  Kenny?  AAAA!
"
Priest,"Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea.
"
Kyle,"Oh God, it's true.
"
Priest,"But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-
"
Butters,"There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
"
Kyle,"Butters! Butters, stop it!
"
Butters,"But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
"
Kyle,"Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!
"
Butters,"No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
"
Kyle,"No! Butters, stop! 
"
Butters,"Haah! Leave me alone! 
"
Kyle,"Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
"
Commentator,"Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key.
"
Elin,"You motherfucker! I never should have married you! 
"
Tiger,"Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it! 
"
Elin,"How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!
"
Stan,"Aw dude, I clocked you!
"
Cartman,"I told you this game was sweet, dude.
"
Stan,"Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
"
Cartman,"Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
"
Stan,"Hit A and X together.
"
Announcer,"Round 2. Fight!! 
"
Cartman,"Oh, you're going down, Elin!
"
Stan,"I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
"
Announcer,"Pre-nup power-up. 
"
Cartman,"Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
"
Therapist,"All right, sex addicts. What other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall?  Anyone have another example? Let's see, how about... David!
"
David Letterman,"Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees.
"
Therapist,"""Sex with employees."" Definitely a danger there. What else? Uh, Mr. Clinton.
"
Bill Clinton,"Putting cigars in girls' vaginas?
"
Therapist,"Very good, Billy.  ""cigars in vaginas."" Not the best idea there.
"
Charlie Sheen,"Watching Internet porn all day every day?
"
Therapist,"Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive  ""Internet porn."" Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row.
"
Kyle,"Hello?
"
The men,"Hey Kyle, hi Kyle.
"
Therapist,"And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?
"
Kyle,"Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
"
Bill Clinton,"Does your mom have big tits?
"
Therapist,"Billy!
"
Bill Clinton,"Sorry...
"
Butters,"Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
"
Ben Roethlisberger,"I heard that.
"
Butters,"I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
"
Therapist,"Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off!
"
David Duchovny,"Aw, gee whiz!
"
Expert 4,"To better understand the sex addiction outbreak, we've been running tests on chimpanzees.  You can see that this entire community of specimens are getting along normally, some pairing off, others on their own, but now see this chimp here.  An average adult normal male blending in seamlessly with the others. Now watch. We're going to give it a lot of money.  Go ahead. 
"
Chairman,"My God...
"
Expert 4,"Yes...  The subject is now isolated and shunned.
"
Chairman,"Incredible. And, and what's it doing now?
"
Expert 4,"Making a public apology on its talk show. 
"
Therapist,"Alrighty. Now, we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament, don't we? What is the main thing we've all learned to avoid?  Yes, Tiger?
"
Tiger Woods,"Avoid drugs? And alcohol?
"
The other men,"Auugh!
"
Therapist,"No, no, Tiger, you still aren't getting it.  In order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors, we must avoid... anyone? Avoid getting... anyone?
"
Michael Douglas,"Caught.
"
Therapist,"Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone!
"
The Men,"Getting caught.
"
Therapist,"Very good! You are all here in therapy  because you got caught! So how do we avoid getting caught? Ben Rothlisberger?
"
Ben Rothlisberger,"Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms?
"
David Letterman,"When they uh ask you for money, pay them.
"
Therapist,"Good, yes!
"
Kyle,"Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. 
"
Bill Clinton,"What the fuck are you talkin' about?
"
Kyle,"Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. 
"
Therapist,"Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl.
"
Chairman,"Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop.
"
Obama,"So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.
"
Chairman,"No good, Mr. President. Because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to make money and become successful in order to feed their addiction.
"
Obama,"You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??
"
Chairman,"Yes. That's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues! We tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now. Then we looked at the backside, and found this.  Independence Hall.
"
Obama,"The birthplace of our country.
"
Chairman,"We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men.
"
Obama,"Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country.
"
Chairman,"And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?!
"
Obama,"It's the only explanation that makes any sense. 
"
Tiger,"I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-
"
Elin,"You motherfucker!
"
Tiger,"Oh no!
"
Elin,"I should have never married  youuu! 
"
Tiger,"Agh! Stop it!
"
Elin,"A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?! 
"
Cartman,"Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
"
Stan,"Yeah, back in that water level.  Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense.
"
Kyle,"Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
"
Therapist,"We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all!
"
Butters,"Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
"
Therapist,"Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense.
"
Kyle,"...As soon as what's dead? 
"
Therapist,"The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall!
"
SWAT Officer 1,"Entrance is clear, Mr. President. 
"
Chairman,"Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this.
"
SWAT Officer 2,"Right side clear!
"
Expert 4,"We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility.
"
Obama,"Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard.
"
Expert 10,"Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts.
"
Obama,"Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.
"
SWAT Officer 2,"Okay okay alright alright, hang, hang on guys. I mean, come on, this is getting a little ridiculous. Wizard aliens? We all know what's going on here, don't we? Whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy going around and having sex with tons of girls, we all wanna act like we don't understand it, but we do. We're guys, you know? Our brains are wired to strive to be the alpha male and get all the women we can.  I mean, look where we are. Even, even Benjamin Franklin screwed everything that moved. Because he could. We don't have to condone what these rich, famous people do, but... we can at least admit that, given the same temptations and opportunities that somebody like Tiger Woods has, a lot of us guys might do somethin' similar. 
"
Obama,"We have a turd in the punch bowl.
"
Secret Service Agent,"Turd in the punch bowl. 
"
SWAT Officer 2,"Hey, what are you doin- No. No, come on.  Where are you takin' me?
"
News 4 Reporter,"Ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in Independence Hall. By all accounts, the alien is also a wizard, who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country. 
"
SWAT Officer 3,"Mr. President, here they are. 
"
Therapist,"This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers.
"
Chairman,"Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?
"
Kyle,"I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
"
Chairman,"A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!
"
Obama,"Quick, give that boy a gun! 
"
Kyle,"What?
"
SWAT Officer 3,"You'd better take one too. 
"
Obama,"Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs. 
"
Kyle,"What bastard?
"
Obama,"The alien wizard hiding out here! Come on, we've got tuh- 
"
Chairman,"The hell was that?
"
SWAT Officer 4,"I got a baaad feelin' about this. 
"
Dr. Tonton,"Oh my God there it is!
"
Chairman,"It's the alien wizard! It's gonna get you boys! Shoot it! 
"
Obama,"Shoot it boys!
"
Expert 6,"You have to shoot it! 
"
Chairman,"Shoot it again, it's still alive! 
"
SWAT Officer 5,"You gotta reload! 
"
Expert 4,"Keep firing, boys! Shoot it in the heart! 
"
Obama,"Keep shooting it!
"
Expert 11,"Shoot him in his blabber mouth! 
"
Chairman,"My God, they've done it!
"
Bill Clinton,"Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body!
"
David Letterman,"I can feel it! I'm free!
"
Another addict,"We are healed!
"
Obama,"We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell. 
"
Randy,"Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? 
"
News 4 Reporter,"We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?
"
Kyle,"I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 
"
Butters,"Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
"
Tiger,"I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys.  So I officially announce my return to golf.
"
Cartman,"What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
"
Stan,"Yeah, where's all the fighting?
"
Cartman,"Dude, screw this!  Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!
"
Stan,"Yeah, golf is stupid again. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Okay kids, let's take our seats.  There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read.
"
Cartman,"Aww, books? God, I hate those!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. 
"
Cartman,"Oh really? Sweet.
"
Mr. Garrison,"It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqué parts... 
"
Stan,"All right!
"
Mr. Garrison,"...and strong vulgar language...
"
Kenny,"(Awesome, dude!)
"
Mr. Garrison,"...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
"
Cartman,"Oho man, I can't wait!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
"
Cartman,"No on, come on, let's read it now!
"
Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! 
"
Cartman,"Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
"
Mr. Garrison,"You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!
"
Class,"Awww!
"
Stan,"Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
"
Kyle,"No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is.
"
Stan,"I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times.
"
Kyle,"I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. 
"
Cartman,"Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!""
"
Kyle,"Why the hell was this book banned?!
"
Cartman,"They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
"
Kenny,"(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
"
Cartman,"We know, we were just saying that.
"
Stan,"Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
"
Butters,"Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
"
Stephen,"John Lennon's dead, Butters.
"
Butters,"Aww. Dangit. 
"
Kyle,"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
"
Cartman,"It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
"
Stan,"Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
"
Cartman,"Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, sweet.
"
Kenny,"(Awesome.)
"
Kyle,"The Tale of... 
"
Cartman,"The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
"
Kenny,"(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)
"
Kyle,"Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
"
Cartman,"It was a... a warm spring morning. 
"
Sharon,"""The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs""?  ""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his""...  Ew. ""He took a...""  What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! ""He then grabbed his dog's""  Ehohoh, oh my God! ""Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered""  Nooo! Nooo!  Noho! Nooo! 
"
Sharon,"Randy?  Randy! Randy, you need to read this!
"
Randy,"Read what?
"
Sharon,"This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
"
Randy,"So?
"
Sharon,"Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!
"
Randy,"Huh?
"
Sharon,"I mean it's disgusting.  It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!
"
Randy,"""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-"" Ew, Sharon, gross!
"
Sharon,"Nono, just keep reading.
"
Randy,"""He took a- and then-"" Oh, man. Oh, this- 
"
Sharon,"I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end.
"
Randy,"Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!
"
Sharon,"Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
"
Randy,"""Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-"" What? ""He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-""  ""That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest."" Oh... Oh, man.
"
Sharon,"Well?
"
Randy,"It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
"
Sharon,"Right? It's not just me.
"
Randy,"No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!
"
Sharon,"What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean.
"
Randy,"NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
"
Cartman,"Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
"
Stan,"Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
"
Cartman,"...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
"
Stan,"Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
"
Kyle,"Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
"
Cartman,"And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
"
Stan,"Well dude, somebody has got to go down!
"
Cartman,"Butters, what are you up to?
"
Butters,"Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
"
Kim,"Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!
"
Butters,"Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
"
Stan,"Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!
"
Butters,"I am?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
"
Butters,"Oh no. Which book was that?
"
Cartman,"Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
"
Butters,"I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
"
Sharon,"Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this.
"
Sheila,"We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
"
Stan,"Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
"
Cartman,"That's right.
"
Randy,"Butters? Is that true?
"
Butters,"Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
"
Gerald,"Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read.
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Kyle,"What? 
"
Gerald,"Yeah, it's really amazing.
"
Butters,"Oh, thanks.
"
Sheila,"We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it.
"
Mr. Needlebaum,"Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel.
"
Stan,"Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!
"
Kyle,"Yeah, we wrote that!
"
Randy,"Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.
"
Kyle,"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
"
Butters,"I wrote that. 
"
Stephen,"Really amazing.
"
Stan,"What? Hey! 
"
News Anchor,"It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called ""literary genius."" The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting.
"
News Anchor,"The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages.
"
News Anchor,"The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. 
"
Clyde,"Hey, here he comes!
"
Mr. Adler,"Amazing book, Butters. 
"
Butters,"Thank you! 
"
Mrs. Streibel,"You've changed my life, young man.
"
Butters,"That's nice. 
"
Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
Butters,"Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
"
Kyle,"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
"
Butters,"But, you told me I did!
"
Stan,"Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! 
"
Red,"Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist.
"
Lola,"He's so brooding and full of angst.
"
Butters,"Yeah, I'm broooding.
"
Cartman,"Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
"
Rebecca,"Oh God, you guys are pathetic!
"
Lola,"Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once. 
"
Stan,"God-damnit!
"
Kyle,"Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
"
Butters,"No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
"
Cartman,"That inconsiderate jerk!
"
Announcer,"Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, ""How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook""  ""And Not Vomit?""  The book is full of disgusting words and acts, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times.  Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book?
"
Broderick,"Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me.
"
Announcer,"Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress? 
"
Matt Lauer,"Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents.
"
Stephen,"Hello Matt
"
Linda,"Hi everyone.
"
Matt Lauer,"You must be pretty proud of your son.
"
Stephen,"Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented.
"
Meredith Vieira,"And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?
"
Stephen,"Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course.
"
Butters,"I have to come right to my room after school.
"
Stephen,"But we are very very proud nonetheless.
"
Al Roker,"Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?
"
Butters,"Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
"
Matt Lauer,"All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's  Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?
"
Butters,"Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so.
"
Meredith Vieira,"Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings? 
"
Al Roker,"Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?
"
Butters,"Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
"
Al Roker,"Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters.
"
Butters,"Oh really?  Oh yeah, gosh dangit.
"
Stan,"More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
"
Assemblyman 1,"That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
"
Cartman,"There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
"
Assemblyman 2,"You just fail to understand what the author meant.
"
Kyle,"The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
"
Assemblyman 3,"No, no no, that's such a simplistic view.
"
Stan,"Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
"
Assemblywoman 1,"Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?
"
Kyle,"Yes!
"
Assemblywoman 1,"But what would be the point?
"
Cartman,"There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
"
Assemblywoman 2,"No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.
"
"Stan, Kyle, Cartman","Yes they would!
"
Assemblywoman 2,"It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.
"
Stan,"What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!
"
Assemblyman 2,"Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country.
"
Stan,"What?
"
Assemblywoman 2,"Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!
"
Assemblyman 2,"What book did you read?!
"
Stan,"There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
"
Assemblyman 4,"Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake? 
"
Field Reporter,"Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room. 
"
Field Reporter,"Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
"
Butters,"Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
"
Field Reporter,"Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
"
Butters,"Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
"
Stephen,"Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!
"
Butters,"Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. 
"
Stan,"I can't believe they won't ban our book!
"
Kyle,"I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
"
Kenny,"(It's fucking disgusting!)
"
Cartman,"All right you guys, I know what we have to do.  We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker.
"
Kyle,"What?! 
"
Cartman,"Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
"
Kyle,"Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! 
"
Cartman,"Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
"
Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
"
Cartman,"Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
"
Kenny,"(Okay.)
"
Cartman,"Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. 
"
Matt,"Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed.
"
Meredith,"Al, how is it out there?
"
Al,"I don't know if you could see this, guys, but uh, the line stretches all the way around the block. People waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel.  And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith.
"
Meredith,"Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat.
"
Matt,"That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman.
"
Morgan Freeman,"The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, ""I need to poop."" ""Okay,"" Rebecca replied, ""I like poop."" Douglas squatted down  over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener.  Chapter 2...
"
Cartman,"See any hunters yet?
"
Kenny,"(Not yet) 
"
Cartman,"Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there.
"
Kyle,"Guys, stop, stop!  We don't have to do this!
"
Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
Kyle,"Butters wrote a second book!
"
Cartman,"So what?
"
Stan,"So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
"
Kyle,"We can get people to believe us now!
"
Cartman,"Oh dude, sweet! 
"
Morgan Freeman,"""Why are we here?"" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all.
"
Shopper 1,"""The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs.""
"
Shopper 2,"""And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt.""
"
Stan,"Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
"
Cartman,"People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
"
Shopper 3,"Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?
"
Marsha,"So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book.
"
Shopper 4,"I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots.
"
Cartman,"What?!
"
Stan,"You can't be serious! You people like this?!
"
Shopper 5,"Some of the imagery is unbelievable
"
Kyle,"A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
"
Shopper 6,"Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh?  Didn't like what the book had to say?

Marsha,"What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!
"
Cartman,"Oh come on!

Kim,"Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.
"
The Kardashians,"Yaaay!
"
Male Guest,"Can I go with you girls? 
"
News Anchor 2,"Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians..  wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book.
"
News Anchor 2,"Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK! 
"
Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
"
Butters,"I know.
"
Stan,"They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
"
Butters,"You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
"
Kyle,"Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
"
Stan,"Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
"
Butters,"Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
"
Cartman,"That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
"
Butters,"What?
"
Cartman,"You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
"
Butters,"What?! Oh no!
"
Cartman,"Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
"
Butters,"Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly.

"
Cartman,"Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
"
Coach,"You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
"
Cartman,"I know, it sucks. 
"
Coach,"Alright kids, practice is over for today.
"
Cartman,"KFC!! 
"
Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
"
Kyle,"Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
"
Cartman,"Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you!  Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!
"
Stan,"Hey it looks different.
"
Randy,"Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?
"
Customer,"Oh, it's not a KFC anymore. It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary. 
"
Stan,"A what?
"
Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
"
Kyle,"So where's the KFC now?
"
Randy,"Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 
"
Clerk,"Can I help you sir?
"
Randy,"Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
"
Clerk,"Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here.
"
Randy,"Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?
"
Clerk,"Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
"
Randy,"Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
"
Clerk,"Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
"
Randy,"My huh?
"
Clerk,"Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary.
"
Randy,"Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! 
"
Stan,"What'd they say?
"
Randy,"KFC's gone, been replaced.
"
Cartman,"They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
"
Randy,"Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 
"
Stan,"The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.
"
Randy,"I gotta get to the doctor! 
"
Kyle,"...so no KFC?
"
Cartman,"This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
"
Dr. Doctor,"Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal.
"
Randy,"All right!
"
Dr. Doctor,"Yep, you check out fine.
"
Randy,"That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
"
Dr. Doctor,"For what?
"
Randy,"Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
"
Dr. Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana.
"
Randy,"But you said I'm totally healthy!
"
Dr. Doctor,"Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!
"
Randy,"...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
"
Dr. Doctor,"Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
"
Randy,"Yeah, but what's the quickest way?
"
Dr. Doctor,"The what?
"
Randy,"Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?
"
Cartman,"Mom, drive faster!
"
Liane,"The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient.
"
Cartman,"Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
"
Liane,"Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?
"
Cartman,"WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
"
Liane,"Alright honey, let's take it easy.
"
Cartman,"Fuck you!
"
Cartman,"No! No, what's going on?!  Move aside! 
"
Worker 1,"It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there.
"
Cartman,"No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
"
Worker 1,"Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas.
"
Cartman,"You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
"
Worker 2,"No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal.
"
Cartman,"Nooooooooo-! 
"
Stan,"Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
"
Randy,"Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 
"
Clerk 2,"Can I help you?
"
Cartman,"I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
"
Clerk 2,"Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-
"
Cartman,"Really?
"
Clerk 2,"-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. 
"
Cartman,"Whoa, what uh, are you serious?  Oh my God, that's KFC gravy!  You have KFC! Yes!  This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!
"
Clerk 2,"This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
"
Cartman,"Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
"
Clerk 2,"If you don't want it, that's fine-
"
Cartman,"NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
"
Randy,"""Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers."" Alright.  ""Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are...""  ""slow-growing and can take years to develop."" Dammit.  ""Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive."" Oh this is good. ""There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation"" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?
"
Randy,"Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!
"
Sharon,"Wha... WAAAAA! 
"
Dr. Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer.
"
Randy,"SCORE! 
"
Dr. Doctor,"Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-
"
Randy,"Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
"
Dr. Doctor,"Your prescription for what?
"
Randy,"Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
"
Randy,"One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
"
Randy,"Uh that is nice! That is nice!
"
Jimbo,"Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!
"
Randy,"I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
"
Jimbo,"No, I mean, your actual balls!
"
Randy,"Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! 
"
Tough Boy 1,"Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC.
"
Cartman,"Yeah. Who isn't?
"
Tough Boy 1,"Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house.
"
Cartman,"Billy Miller? Seriously??
"
Billy,"Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?
"
Cartman,"Tommy said you have some KFC.
"
Billy,"Suuure.  Jessie. 
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!
"
Billy,"I have my sources. That'll be $85.
"
Cartman,"85 bucks?? I don't have that! 
"
Billy,"Hold on, hold on.  You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up.
"
Cartman,"How much KFC are we talking?
"
Billy,"Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
"
Cartman,"Holy fuck, dude.
"
Billy,"I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?
"
Cartman,"Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
"
Billy,"Excellent.
"
Randy,"Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
"
Cartman,"Are you Teabag?
"
Teabag,"Maybe I am. Who's askin'?
"
Cartman,"Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
"
Teabag,"Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money?  Alright, we're in biz.  It's all there, man.
"
Cartman,"Extra crispy? 
"
Teabag,"'Course, man, I ain't no fool.
"
Cartman,"You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
"
Teabag,"Awww, it's all the same shit, man.
"
Cartman,"IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 
"
Teabag,"Okay okay I'm sorry, oh... 
"
Cartman,"You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
"
Teabag,"I'll take back the gravy.
"
Cartman,"Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
"
Teabag,"AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too! 
"
Barbrady,"What's going on back there?
"
Cartman,"Nothin', it's cool.
"
Jimbo,"Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned.
"
Randy,"Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
"
Nelson,"Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy.
"
Randy,"No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
"
Player 1,"Aw some on, just give us a little bit.
"
Player 2,"Yeah.
"
Randy,"Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else.  Chicks... love 'em.
"
Nelson,"Women love huge balls?
"
Randy,"Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going ""whaaa?"" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 
"
Woman 1,"Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa? 
"
Randy,"See?
"
Billy,"Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?
"
Cartman,"Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 
"
Billy,"Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!
"
Cartman,"Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
"
Billy,"That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little ""arrangement"" with the Colonel himself.
"
Cartman,"Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
"
Billy,"That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
"
Cartman,"Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
"
Billy,"Excellent.
"
Nurse,"Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. 
"
Dr. Doctor,"What the hell is going on?
"
Nurse,"Doctor?
"
Dr. Doctor,"This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.
"
Jimbo,"Heh, I am stoned off my ass!
"
Player 3,"I'm stoned off my balls! 
"
Randy,"Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
"
Woman 2,"Wow. Those guys have nice balls.
"
Woman 3,"Wish my man had balls like those.
"
Woman 2,"Mmm.
"
The Colonel,"Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit.
"
Tommy,"We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?
"
Cartman,"I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
"
The Colonel,"I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend. Cartman: Who? You mean Tommy?  Wait, where's he go?
"
The Colonel,"Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked.
"
The Colonel,"And how do I know you're not a liar too?
"
Cartman,"Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
"
The Colonel,"I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time.
"
Cartman,"Good.
"
The Colonel,"Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me. 
"
Sharon,"Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger.
"
Randy,"I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
"
Sharon,"Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? 
"
Randy,"Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?
"
Sharon,"Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-
"
Randy,"Hey. My eyes are up here.
"
Sharon,"I'm sorry, I just...
"
Randy,"It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 
"
Randy,"Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
"
Clerk,"I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store.
"
Randy,"Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?
"
Clerk,"Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
"
Randy,"Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
"
Billy,"What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!
"
Cartman,"Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
"
Billy,"...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!
"
Cartman,"Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
"
Billy,"How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!
"
Cartman,"...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer.
"
Billy,"What is that supposed to mean?
"
Cartman,"I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
"
Billy,"You wouldn't do that.
"
Cartman,"Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
"
Billy's Mom,"Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!
"
Cartman,"Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
"
Randy,"What do we want?
"
Men,"Bigger doors!
"
Randy,"Where do we want them?
"
Men,"Weed stores!
"
Randy,"What do we want?
"
Men,"Bigger doors!
"
Randy,"Where do we want them?
"
Men,"Weed stores!
"
Clerk,"Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure.
"
Man 1,"Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
"
Man 2,"Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others.
"
Clerk,"Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous.
"
Man 3,"What's ridiculous about it?
"
Dr. Doctor,"Hold on, hold people people, please!  We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!
"
Tough Boy 2,"Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff.
"
Cartman,"Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
"
Tough Boy 3,"Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed.
"
Cartman,"What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.
"
The Colonel,"Hello. Hello??
"
Cartman,"Colonel, how are you doing?
"
The Colonel,"What happened?
"
Cartman,"Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 
"
The Colonel,"Eric, what happened??
"
Cartman,"We had a little problem.
"
The Colonel,"I heard.
"
Cartman,"Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
"
The Colonel,"Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!
"
Cartman,"Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
"
The Colonel,"There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
"
Cartman,"Hey, take it easy Colonel.
"
The Colonel,"I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!
"
Cartman,"Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
"
Barbrady,"Freeze!
"
Henchman,"It's the cops! 
"
Billy's Mom,"Run Billy, run! 
"
Billy,"Mommy, no!
"
Barbrady,"Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. 
"
Dr. Doctor,"And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. 
"
Randy,"Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 
"
Sharon,"Yeah. Great.
"
Randy,"Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 
"
Sharon,"Randy, I love it! 
"
Randy,"And when it gets cold it shrinks. 
"
Woman 4,"Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?
"
Sharon,"Yyyup!
"
Woman 5,"Luckyyyyy!
"
Cartman,"I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
"
Kyle,"How the hell do you have more friends than me?
"
Cartman,"'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
"
Kyle,"How many friends do you have, Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(Sixty two)
"
Kyle,"What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
"
Stan,"Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
"
Cartman,"Stupid Facebok stuff.
"
Stan,"Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
"
Kyle,"Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
"
Stan,"Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?
"
Cartman,"Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
"
Kyle,"Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
"
Cartman,"Surprise! 
"
Stan,"Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
"
Kyle,"Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
"
Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
Stan,"I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
"
Cartman,"Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
"
Stan,"Who?
"
Cartman,"Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends.  And he's had a profile for more than six months.
"
Kyle,"Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
"
Stan,"You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox. 
"
Kyle,"There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
"
Kip,"Ahhhhh.  Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa! Yeah! 
"
Kip,"Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!
"
Kip's Mom,"Kip, really?
"
Kip's Dad,"You did?
"
Kip,"Yeah!! 
"
Kip's Dad,"Huh son, that's wonderful.
"
Kip's Mom,"What's his name?
"
Kip,"Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading.
"
Kip's Mom,"Oh, is he a nice boy?
"
Kip,"Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?! 
"
Randy,"Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
"
Stan,"Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to.
"
Randy,"Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
"
Stan,"No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
"
Randy,"...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?
"
Stan,"...Dad, you are my friend.
"
Randy,"...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
"
Stan,"Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
"
Randy,"Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
"
Stan,"I just wanna do my homework!
"
Randy,"Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
"
Stan,"Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
"
Randy,"Oh cool! Okay. 
"
Kip,"Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!
"
Kip's Mom,"That's great, Kip!
"
Kip,"Yeah! 
"
Kip's Dad,"They sure are getting to know each other.
"
Kip's Mom,"I'ts amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?
"
Kip's Dad,"His friend lives on a farm?
"
Kyle,"I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
"
Wendy,"Am I a joke to you?
"
Stan,"What?
"
Wendy,"I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?
"
Stan,"...Um, no?
"
Wendy,"You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!
"
Stan,"Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
"
Wendy,"Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?
"
Stan,"Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
"
Wendy,"You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!
"
Stan,"Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
"
Wendy,"And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to ""In a relationship""!
"
Stan,"How?
"
Wendy,"By editing your profile under ""basic information""!
"
Stan,"Okay, I'm sorry!
"
Stan,"""Edit profile. Basic... settings"" Jesus Christ!
"
Randy,"Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
"
Stan,"...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
"
Randy,"Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
"
Stan,"Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
"
Randy,"That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 
"
Stan,"Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
"
Cartman,"Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Can I come in?
"
Stan,"Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?
"
Kyle,"I... don't... have... any... friends...
"
Stan,"What?
"
Kyle,"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
"
Stan,"Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
"
Kyle,"'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?
"
Stan,"NO.
"
Kyle,"Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
"
Stan,"Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
"
Kyle,"You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
"
Stan,"Ah fuck.
"
Stan,"Okay it says I'm at your farm.
"
Kyle,"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
"
Stan,"'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
"
Kip's Dad,"So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?
"
Kip,"Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year.
"
Kip's Mom,"Oh, what'd he say about those?
"
Kip,"He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!
"
Kip's Dad,"Sounds like you boys had a ball!
"
Kip,"Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?
"
Kip's Dad,"Well it's a little late, but it is Friday.
"
Kip's Mom,"I thnk the more time you spend with your little friend, the better.
"
Kip,"Wow, thanks! 
"
Kip's Mom,"Have fun and be safe! 
"
Kip,"Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too.  Hahaa haha! Yeah!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!
"
Wendy,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume.""
"
Stan,"What?
"
Wendy,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."" What is that supposed to mean?!
"
Stan,"...I have no idea.
"
Wendy,"That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! 
"
Stan,"Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 
"
Man 1,"Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?
"
Stan,"Fine! 
"
Man 2,"Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?
"
Stan,"I don't know you!
"
Man 2,"Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! 
"
Randy,"Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
"
Stan,"...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-
"
Randy,"Stan, poke your grandma!
"
Stan,"No. NO! Screw this! You know what? ""Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile."" There! ""Delete Profile""!  ""You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel"" Proceed!  ""Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No."" Yes! ""Are you totally sure?"" Yes! 
"
Computer Voice,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Stan Marsh.
"
Stan,"You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? 
"
Computer Voice,"I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid.
"
Stan,"Delete Profile! ""Are you totally sure? Yes or-"" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 
"
Guard 1,"Alright get moving, Profile.
"
Stan,"Profile? I'm not a profile.
"
Guard 1,"Ignore. 
"
Stan,"AAH. 
"
Profile 1,"Tom Davis says hello to Linda Green's profile.
"
Profile 2,"Linda Davis likes how Tom Davis has changed his status.
"
Stan,"'Scuse me, my name is-
"
Profile 3,"Ignore.
"
Stan,"Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
"
Profile 4,"Ignore.
"
Stan,"Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
"
Kyle,"I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
"
Cartman,"You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
"
Kyle,"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
"
Cartman,"Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip.
"
Kyle,"I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
"
Cartman,"It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
"
Kyle,"No. What's chatroulette?
"
Cartman,"Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
"
Kyle,"Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool.
"
Cartman,"Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
"
Kyle,"Aww, that's some dude jacking off! 
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
"
Kyle,"That's just a guy's penis too!
"
Cartman,"Okay let's, let's try this one.
"
Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
"
Cartman,"Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
"
Dude,"Hey.
"
Cartman,"This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
"
Dude,"Oh yeah? 
"
Cartman,"Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
"
Kyle,"Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
"
Cartman,"Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
"
Stan,"Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
"
Tom Davis,"No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend?
"
Stan,"No, I seriously don't want any more friends.
"
Tom Davis,"Ignore.  So anyway, I really like taking long walks in the summer, you know, because there's like
"
Stan,"Okay I'll be your friend.
"
Tom Davis,"Confirm.  Oooo, Tom Davis is thrilled to have become powerful by adding a new friend. Here are some pictures of my dog. And here he is in some silly outfits. Can you comment on these?
"
Stan,"Awww!
"
Guard,"Move it, profile!
"
Tom Davis,"Oh oh.
"
Stan,"Why oh oh?
"
Profile 5,"They're taking him to the gaming arena.
"
Tom Davis,"Looks like I'm gonna be down a friend. 
"
Referee,"You are about to face each other in combat! You will play the game for the amusement of the users!  Let the game commence! 
"
Stan,"Yahtzee?
"
Referee,"One round only! Begin! 
"
Profile 6,"Uhhh, I'm gonna count five in my five box.
"
Stan,"Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
"
Guard,"Play, profile!
"
Stan,"Yahtzee. 
"
Cartman,"Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
"
Kyle,"That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
"
Cartman,"Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
"
Boy,"Hello.
"
Cartman,"Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
"
Boy,"Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.
"
Kyle,"Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
"
Boy,"Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm.
"
Kyle,"Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
"
Kip's Dad,"Honey, where's Kip? I haven't seen him all day.
"
Kip's Mom,"No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now.
"
Referee,"Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated!
"
Stan,"I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
"
Referee,"That's not what your profile said.
"
Stan,"My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
"
Referee,"Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now.
"
Stan,"Oh yeah? I can try! 
"
Referee,"After him!
"
Kyle,"Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
"
Stan,"You're an asshole, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"...What?
"
Stan,"What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
"
Kyle,"Dude, w-what are you doing?
"
Stan,"What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
"
Kyle,"Profile status?
"
Stan,"Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
"
Kyle,"Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late.
"
Stan,"Dude! Fuck your crops! 
"
Kyle,"Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
"
Stan,"Where?
"
Kyle,"Café World.
"
Stan,"Son of a bitch! 
"
Kyle,"An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ.
"
Randy's profile,"Randy Marsh is at work right now. Work is boring.
"
Butters' profile,"Butters Stotch is enjoying Stan's chat party.
"
Garrison's profile,"Herbert Garrison likes Butters' comment.
"
Grandma Marsh's profile,"Grandma Marsh would like to be friends with Kevin Donahue.
"
Kevin Donahue's profile,"Kevin Donahue accept's Grandma Marsh's friendship.
"
Stan,"Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!
"
Susan92's profile,"Susan92 has pictures of Stan in a bunny costume.
"
Gary Johnson's profile,"Gary Johnson thinks the pictures are fantastic!
"
Kyle,"Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
"
Isiah,"Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend.
"
Kyle,"What? Why?
"
Isiah,"User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock.
"
Kyle,"Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
"
Isiah,"Ignore.
"
Kyle,"Unh, that does it!
"
Stan,"Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 
"
Profile Stan Marsh,"Right here.
"
Stan,"Oh...
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
"
Stan,"What do you want from me, dude?!
"
Profile Stan Marsh,"I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you.
"
Stan,"Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
"
Profile Stan Marsh,"Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world.
"
Stan,"Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
"
Profile Stan Marsh,"Who is more powerful? The user or the profile? Let's end this once and for all. 
"
Referee,"Let the final battle begin! 
"
Stan,"Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? 
"
Profile Stan Marsh,"What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little-
"
Stan,"Yahtzee.
"
Profile Stan Marsh,"What?!
"
Stan,"Yahtzee. Sixes.
"
Profile Stan Marsh,"No. Can't be.
"
Randy,"Yahtzee!
"
Profile Stan Marsh,"No! Ahhhhh. 
"
Stan,"Awgh!  Oh thank God.
"
Randy,"Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
"
Stan,"My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
"
Randy,"Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
"
Stan,"Fuck off, Dad. 
"
Tour Guide,"Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk.
"
Cartman,"Wow, coo'..  Chocolate rules!
"
Kyle,"You should know, fatass.
"
Cartman,"AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
"
Stan,"Oh God, you guys, really? This again? 
"
Tour Guide,"And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.
"
Kyle,"Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
"
Cartman,"I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
"
Stan,"You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
"
Butters,"Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?
"
Stan,"Huh?  Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!
"
Tom Cruise,"What did you call me?
"
Cartman,"Hey, that is Tom Cruise! 
"
Butters,"How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?
"
Tom Cruise,"I'm not a fudge packer!
"
Kyle,"Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
"
Tom Cruise,"But I'm not a fudge packer! 
"
Stan,"Then why are you packing fudge?
"
Tom Cruise,"I'm not. I am a very busy actor who is trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing! 
"
Stan,"Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
"
Tom Cruise,"Oh, that does it. I will SUE you!
"
Stan,"For what?
"
Tom Cruise,"You can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Hey, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise?
"
Tom Cruise,"That's it!  I'm suing this entire intolerant town!
"
Stan,"But dude-
"
Tom Cruise,"No buts! If you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!
"
Tom Cruise,"Guys, I want to really thank you all for coming. Shockingly, I've just been slandered once again in the town of South Park, something I know you can all relate to. 
"
Tiger Woods,"That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies!
"
Bono,"I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
"
Tom Cruise,"Yeah, well I was just over there doing a little fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer!  I know, right? And then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in. 
"
Sally Struthers,"South Park, Colorado, is the most racist, insensitive, and bigoted place in this country! 
"
George Lucas,"That place thinks they can say whatever they want about us and get away with it!
"
Paris Hilton,"If anyone has a gripe against that shithole, it's me! 
"
Tom Cruise,"Yeah, well I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want.
"
All Celebrities,"YEAH!
"
Jared Fogle,"Hey, Tom. I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?
"
Tom Cruise,"Oh, just the door down the hall there, Jared.  No, no, no, that's a closet. Go down more.  No that's a closet too.  Nope, Jared. That's a closet too.  No.  That's a closet... No that- that's a closet too.
"
Principal Victoria,"Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!
"
Kyle,"Dude, what did you do?
"
Stan,"I have no idea...
"
Randy,"You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
"
Principal Victoria,"Did you call him a fudge packer?
"
Stan,"Aww... he was packing fudge!
"
Mayor,"Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!
"
Mr. Mackey,"They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!
"
Stan,"It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
"
Principal Victoria,"But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us.
"
Gerald,"Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!
"
Sgt. Yates,"Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!
"
Randy,"Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
"
Randy,"Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
"
Tom Cruise,"That's nice!  I'm still suing you all! Nobody calls me a fudge packer! 
"
Randy,"Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 
"
Tom Cruise,"WHAT?
"
Randy,"We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
"
Tom Cruise,"I am an actor. I do not pack fudge! 
"
Randy,"Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says ""Fred's Fudge and Candies""... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 
"
Tom Cruise,"Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit.
"
Randy,"ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
"
Tom Cruise,"It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-
"
Randy,"Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
"
Tom Cruise,"Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.
"
Stan,"Ooooooo...
"
Randy,"That's... tricky...
"
Tom Cruise,"Well then you can just get sued! 
"
Randy,"Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-
"
Tom Cruise,"No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear or your little town is DONE!
"
Randy,"Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! 
"
Stephen,"Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.
"
Kyle,"Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.
"
Mr. Mackey,"But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?
"
Sgt. Yates,"Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. 
"
Stan,"I saw him once. 
"
McDaniels,"You did?
"
Stan,"Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?
"
Stan,"No, dude, it was totally fine.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?
"
Stan,"Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
"
Randy,"Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"No, don't!  Is that okay to show?
"
Jimbo,"I don't know. I guess we'll see.
"
Hillary Clinton,"Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense!
"
Jesse Jackson,"Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park.
"
Tom Cruise,"No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?
"
Oprah Winfrey,"You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed?
"
Tom Cruise,"Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power?  Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if no-one could ever call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage?
"
Jimmy Buffet,"I... I'd love it!
"
Tom Cruise,"By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule.  Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since Beetlejuice. And, you put Johnny Depp and all the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, then you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!
"
Tim Burton,"Gee, that'd be swell.
"
Tom Cruise,"Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take that power from him. 
"
Cartman,"Excuse me...  This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?
"
Tom Cruise,"Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!
"
Cartman,"I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
"
Michael Richards,"Who? 
"
Jennifer Lopez,"Alllloooo... 
"
Tom Cruise,"Jennifer Lopez! 
"
Jennifer Lopez,"Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos.
"
Narrator,"In the great hall of the Super Best Friends, there are assembled the leaders of the world's greatest religions; Jesus!  Buddha!  Krishna!  Muhammad!  Lao Tzu and Joseph Smith  and... the mighty Semen! 
"
Seaman,"It's not semen, it's Seaman!
"
Narrator,"Their mission; right that which is wrong, and to serve all mankind.
"
Stan,"Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour.
"
Jesus,"My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances.
"
Buddha,"We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people
"
Stan,"Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
"
Narrator,"Back in the hall of the Super Best Friends...
"
Kyle,"Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
"
Joseph Smith,"No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.
"
Kyle,"K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
"
Lao Tzu,"No, cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble.
"
Stan,"Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
"
Jesus,"But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
"
Kyle,"Aww come on! This is ridiculous! 
"
Joseph Smith,"Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure. 
"
Jesus,"Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! 
"
Kyle,"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
"
Joseph Smith,"But he's talking from the U-Haul?
"
Stan,"Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
"
Jesus,"Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? 
"
Moses,"Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?
"
Kyle,"There doesn't have to be...
"
Moses,"Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.
"
Tom Cruise,"Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.
"
Russel Crowe,"Tom, Tom, you're talkin' crazy mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him? 
"
Rob Reiner,"We take his goo! It's as simple as that friends. 
"
Tom Cruise,"Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.
"
Rob Reiner,"Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another. 
"
Cartman,"Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
"
Tom Cruise,"No Jen, we all have got enough money.
"
Jennifer Lopez,"Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!
"
Cartman,"Uh, excuse us for a second... 
"
Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
"
Jennifer Lopez,"What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!
"
Cartman,"Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
"
Jennifer Lopez,"Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!
"
Cartman,"If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.
"
Mitch Conner,"If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid.
"
Cartman,"You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
"
Mitch Conner,"Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, so what?
"
Mitch Conner,"You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo.
"
Cartman,"So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
"
Mitch Conner,"You catch on quick kid... 
"
Tom Cruise,"Mrs. Lopez...
"
Mitch Conner,"Hurry, get my wig back on! 
"
Tom Cruise,"Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god  you found my fudge packing uniform...
"
Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!
"
Randy,"Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad.
"
Mayor,"Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad. 
"
Muhammad,"You're welcome.
"
Mr Garrison,"Oh, is that okay?
"
Jimbo,"I don't know.
"
Randy,"Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
"
Stan,"What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
"
Gerald,"Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
"
Kyle,"But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Alright, we'll put a sheet over him.
"
Stan,"No, you can't even show his feet.
"
Sheila,"How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
"
Mr. Garrison,"No, you could still see his eyes...
"
Randy,"Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 
"
Mayor,"Muhammad, would that be OK?
"
Muhammad,"OK.
"
Hillary Clinton,"Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us! 
"
Tom Cruise,"Rob, will the machine be ready?
"
Rob Reiner,"Oh, it'll be ready! 
"
Jennifer Lopez,"More tacos!
"
Jennifer Lopez,"More tacos!
"
Cartman,"No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
"
Jennifer Lopez,"More tacos.
"
Cartman,"You just had seven tacos.
"
Jennifer Lopez,"I want more tacos! 
"
Cartman,"I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?
"
Jennifer Lopez,"I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!
"
Cartman,"You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
"
Charlie Sheen,"Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos?
"
Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?
"
Cartman,"Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
"
Jennifer Lopez,"Yes they do!
"
Cartman,"I tried getting one last week!
"
Jennifer Lopez,"Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them.
"
Cartman,"God, will somebody shut her up?
"
Randy,"Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 
"
Mayor,"You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Hold on a second! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!
"
Mayor,"What?!
"
Randy,"Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 
"
Jared Fogle,"Alright, we got him Tom. 
"
Stan,"Muhammad, are you okay? 
"
Randy,"What the hell was that?!
"
Sgt. Yates,"Obviously the terrorists are for real!  What does that paper say?  We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.
"
Stan,"They want his power?
"
Kyle,"What kind of extremists are these? 
"
Sgt. Yates,"You won't believe it...
"
Lead Ginger,"Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again!
"
All Gingers,"Huzzah!
"
Mitch Conner,"Where the hell do you think you're going?
"
Cartman,"I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
"
Mitch Conner,"You gonna walk away from 50 mil? 
"
Cartman,"Let me by...
"
Mitch Conner,"You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life.
"
Cartman,"Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.
"
Mitch Conner,"Then I guess I won't tell you about your father. 
"
Cartman,"My father...
"
Mitch Conner,"Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?
"
Cartman,"I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
"
Mitch Conner,"You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. 
"
Cartman,"How could you know anything about who my family is?
"
Mitch Conner,"Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return.
"
Cartman,"If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
"
Mitch,"You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else...
"
Barbrady,"Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!
"
Mayor,"Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!
"
Jimbo,"We have to give in to their demands.
"
McDaniels,"I'm sorry Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over the gingers.
"
Kyle,"We can't give him over to the gingers!
"
Stan,"Yeah, we said we'd take care of him.
"
Gerald,"But our homes and our lives are at stake.
"
Stan,"We made a promise... to Jesus! 
"
Randy,"Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 
"
Jimbo,"That'll be Tom Cruise... 
"
Randy,"Helllo?
"
Tom Cruise,"Yeah, so whats going on?
"
Randy,"Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
"
Tom Cruise,"What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!
"
Randy,"There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
"
Tom Cruise,"Gingers?
"
Kanye West,"Gingers? Aww, hell no.
"
Randy,"Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
"
Tom Cruise,"You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?
"
Randy,"Well, yeah.
"
Tom Cruise,"Oh, we can play that game too! You want to see violence, well you got it! 
"
Tom Cruise,"Goddamn stupid assholes! You want to play rough?! OK! Spielburg, go and get some automatic rifles! We'll go in there, and we're going to take  Muhammad by force! And then we are going to show them th- 
"
Rob Reiner,"Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent.
"
Hillary Clinton,"Yeah, that would kill all our careers!
"
Tom Cruise,"But the only way we are going to get Muhammad from South Park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers!
"
Rob Reiner,"Fine, then let's have Her do it.
"
Tom Cruise,"Her who?
"
Rob Reiner,"You know... Her.
"
Tom Cruise,"Oh right...  Her.
"
Rob Reiner,"There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand.
"
Robert Redford,"My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember.
"
Steven Spielberg,"Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?
"
Tom Cruise,"Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.
"
Rob Reiner,"Power her up! Release the Kraken! 
"
Rob Reiner,"Hey Barbra. It's me, Rob Reiner. 
"
Rob Reiner,"Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help
"
Tom Cruise,"We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand? 
"
Tom Cruise,"Oh, she's pissed all right.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Eric, what are you doing here?
"
Cartman,"Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
"
Mr. Garrison,"What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
"
Cartman,"I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-
"
Cartman,"I said GET. Mr. Hat!
"
Cartman,"Put it on!  Do the voice.
"
Mr. Hat,"Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat. 
"
Mitch Conner,"Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?
"
Mr. Hat,"I... I don't believe I know you.
"
Mitch Conner,"The name's Mitch Conner, I flew the same division as you back in Saigon. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-
"
Cartman,"Keep... your hand... UP!
"
Randy,"Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 
"
Lead Ginger,"Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that that is still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume...
"
Townspeople,"Ohhhhhhh...
"
Stan,"Dude, we can't do that
"
Lead Ginger,"Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!
"
Mr. Hat,"Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!
"
Mitch Conner,"So you admit it. There was a cover up. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"No Mr. Hat, don't say any more!
"
Mitch,"Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know!
"
Garrison,"Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with.
"
Cartman,"By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
"
Mitch Conner,"Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death.  A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see.  I tried to sit it out as much as I could. 
"
Soldier 1,"What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?
"
Mitch Conner,"No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner.
"
Soldier 2,"Incoming! 
"
Army Doctor,"Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son.
"
Mitch Conner,"And that's that. ""Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam.""  So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.
"
Mitch Conner,"Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
"
Cartman,"That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
"
Mr. Garrison,"All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
"
Randy,"Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
"
Ginger 1,"We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.
"
Stan,"It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
"
Ginger 1,"Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!
"
Jimbo,"Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed.
"
Ginger 1,"Two!
"
Sgt. Yates,"Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed.
"
Ginger 1,"Three!
"
Randy,"Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 
"
Stan,"Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.
"
Ginger 2,"That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus.
"
Santa,"Sorry, boys. I tried.
"
Kyle,"Aw crap.
"
Randy,"Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
"
Stan,"When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
"
Mr. Hankey,"I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you.
"
Stan,"If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
"
Ginger 1,"So where is he?! 
"
Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends...
"
Jesus,"Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem.
"
Buddha,"Ohhh, and you're one to talk! With all your Internet porn!
"
Jesus,"Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!
"
Joseph Smith,"Jesus Christ!
"
Jesus,"What?
"
Joseph Smith,"We've got a distress signal coming in. 
"
Jesus,"On the Super Best Screen!
"
Police Officer,"Super Best Friends! You've got to help us! The Casa Bonita is under attack! 
"
Jesus,"Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand! 
"
Lao Tse,"I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith.
"
Seaman,"Yeah. Who would have activated her again?
"
Jesus,"I don't know, Seaman. 
"
Seaman,"It's Sea-Man! 
"
Police Officer,"The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us!
"
Jesus,"Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her!  On the Super Best Friends power cycles! 
"
Dr. Mephesto,"There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of.  Ah, Kevin. You brought me my Fonseca. That's a good boy.  What's this? Someone is at the door, Kevin.  We tried to be left alone, Kevin. Who would disturb us at this hour? We must be careful.  Why, it's an African-American man, Kevin.  Yes? What do you want?
"
Person,"Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone?
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in.
"
Person,"Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!
"
Dr. Mephesto,"There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.
"
Person,"Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house.
"
Dr. Mephesto,"No, please, it isn't that at all.
"
Person,"No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone.
"
Dr. Mephesto,"No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in. 
"
Cartman,"Ahaaa!
"
Dr. Mephesto,"WAAH!
"
Kevin,"AAAH!
"
Cartman,"Nice work, Conner.
"
Mitch Conner,"Yeah, the old ""Hasn't anything changed?"" speech. Works on white people all the time.
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Eric Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
"
Santa,"Holy crap! 
"
Pip,"Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits.  Haaah! 
"
Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom, which is Tom Cruise's house.
"
Tom Cruise,"How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!
"
Randy,"Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!
"
Tom Cruise,"We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!
"
Randy,"We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
"
Tom Cruise,"That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all!
"
Mickey Mouse,"Oh boy!
"
Stan,"Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!
"
Kenny,"(I am. He's right here.) 
"
Stan,"Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
"
Kyle,"Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
"
Stan,"The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
"
Kyle,"Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
"
Kenny,"(What?)
"
Kyle,"Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
"
Stan,"...Yeah.
"
Kyle,"I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! 
"
Richard Tweek,"She's going to get our coffee store next.
"
Mr. Slave,"Ooooo, Jesus Christ. 
"
Jesus,"That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa!  Smith! Try your ice breath! 
"
Joseph Smith,"No good!
"
Seaman,"Look out! Barbra Streisand is using her toxic stink ray! 
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them.
"
Cartman,"Them who?!
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated.
"
Cartman,"Then start explaining it to me!
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Very well.
"
Kyle,"Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
"
Stan,"Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in! 
"
Kyle,"Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Oh, all right.
"
Cartman,"No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
"
Stan,"Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
"
Cartman,"It's all that matters!
"
Kyle,"Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!
"
Cartman,"I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
"
Announcer,"In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer. 
"
Seaman,"Our powers aren't working, Swallow. 
"
Joseph Smith,"We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!
"
Jesus,"We have to find another weak spot!  Moses!
"
Moses,"What?
"
Jesus,"We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!
"
Moses,"Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.
"
Jesus,"All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman,  you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. 
"
Seaman,"It's Sea-Man and Swallow.
"
Jesus,"Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!
"
Seaman,"Fine! Swallow, come. 
"
Moses,"Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.
"
Stan,"Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
"
Dr. Mephesto,"It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
"
Kyle,"Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
"
Mitch Conner,"Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?
"
Kyle,"Oh, you are not doing that again!
"
Mitch Conner,"Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!
"
Kyle,"Stop talking with your stupid hand!
"
Cartman,"Who you calling stupid, Jew?
"
Stan,"Come on, guys, we're running out of time! 
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Yes?
"
Man,"Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone.
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American.
"
Man,"...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Beat it I'm not helpin' you!
"
Kyle,"Dude!
"
Stan,"That's not cool!
"
Dr. Mephesto,"No no, you don't understand.
"
Kyle,"We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
"
Stan,"We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
"
Dr. Mephesto,"Alright, alright, jeez. 
"
Ginger 1,"Hahaaa!
"
Stan,"Oh crap, the gingers!
"
Cartman,"Gingers? No!
"
Announcer,"L-later, at the Legion of Doom.
"
Benedict XVI,"Tom, Tom! The gingers are claiming they have Muhammad!
"
Tom Cruise,"What?! Impossible!
"
Benedict XVI,"They are sending a message now!
"
Tom Cruise,"On screen! 
"
Ginger 1,"We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad!
"
Rob Reiner,"He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!
"
Ginger 1,"Why do you think we're calling?!
"
Ginger 3,"Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!
"
Tom Cruise,"...Your ...boss?
"
Dr. Mephesto,"What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go.
"
Ginger 1,"Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!
"
Stan,"What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
"
Ginger 2,"Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him.
"
Cartman,"Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
"
Mitch Conner,"You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid.
"
Cartman,"Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
"
Mitch Conner,"You might wanna 
"
Cartman,"Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. 
"
A Voice,"Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this.
"
Cartman,"Daddy?
"
A Voice,"Guess again.  Welcome, to my Chili Con Carnival.
"
Cartman,"Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
"
A Voice,"Oh, but it can.  Revenge is a dish best served...  chili.
"
Cartman,"Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
"
Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the concert stage Jesus built with his power of super-carpentry...
"
Joseph Smith,"That's it, Jesus. The band has been paid and the PA system is working.
"
Jesus,"Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you.
"
Krishna,"Form of... Neil Diamond.  If you all wouldn't mind, I'd like to invite a special friend to join me on stage. Miss Barbra Streisand! 
"
Jesus,"Let's hope to Christ this works. 
"
Krishna,"Hello gorgeous. What do you say? Shall we sing together again like the old times? 
Well that's because I love the girl. 
And I still love you now. What have you got to say? 
That might be true, but I still miss ya at night. 
When you roll over, by my side, and you kiss me goodnight. 
"
Joseph Smith,"It worked, Jesus!
"
Jesus,"Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!
"
Scott Tenorman,"Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric.  A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father.  Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be?  You've been lied to by everyone!  Even by your own mother!  Hahahahahahahaha. 
"
Cartman,"What do you know?!
"
Scott Tenorman,"I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!
"
Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair...
"
Russell Crowe,"Alright, Muhammad is secure. 
"
Tom Cruise,"Let's do this. Throw the switch, Rob.  Ohhh. Uhhh. Yes! I can feel it! I can feel the power to not be ridiculed flowing through my veins!  Ha. Hahahaha! 
"
Paris Hilton,"O M G it worked!
"
Tom Cruise,"I've done it! I've done it! Look at me! I'm not okay to make fun of anymore!
"
Benedict XVI,"Ooo you lucky fucker.
"
Scott Tenorman,"Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival!
"
Liane,"Please, leave my boy alone!
"
Cartman,"Mom?
"
Scott Tenorman,"I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Please don't. We have to protect 'em.
"
Cartman,"Protect who??
"
Scott Tenorman,"Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr...  Jimbo! 
"
Jimbo,"Protect... the Denver Broncos.
"
Announcer,"Meanwhile...
"
Tom Cruise,"This is incredible. Who wants to go next?
"
Benedict XVI,"I want to be next.
"
Ginger 4,"No, gingers go next.
"
Mickey Mouse,"Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!
"
Rob Reiner,"It's my goo machine! I'm next!
"
Jesus,"Nobody is going next!  Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!
"
Ginger 4,"They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!
"
Jesus,"Kyaaaaa!
"
Scott Tenorman,"The Denver Broncos.  There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!
"
Mr. Garrison,"They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
"
Cartman,"My dad was a Denver Bronco?
"
Scott Tenorman,"Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?
"
Cartman,"No- nooo.
"
Scott Tenorman,"The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!
"
Liane,"No please!
"
Scott Tenorman,"Tell him! You almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!
"
Dr. Mephesto,"It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
"
Scott Tenorman,"You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
"
Cartman,"No! Noooo!
"
Scott Tenorman,"Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Now eat your chili!  The Super Best Friends? Oh no! 
"
Seaman,"I'll get you, Tom Cruise! 
"
Stan,"Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 
"
Tom Cruise,"What did you say?!
"
Kyle,"Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
"
Jesus,"I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman. 
"
Tom Cruise,"Whoawhoa whoa whoa!  You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?!
"
Scott Tenorman,"I'll be back, Super Best Friends! 
"
Jesus,"Who's the creepy ginger kid?
"
Tom Cruise,"Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!
"
Kyle,"That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
"
Jesus,"That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.
"
Santa,"That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Mayor McDaniels,"Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.
"
Stan,"Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...
"
Kyle,"Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
"
Cartman,"Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
"
Cartman,"My dad was a ginger!
"
Kyle,"Wwait, what?
"
Cartman,"I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
"
Kyle,"Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
"
Mitch Conner,"Hey Eric, Eric!
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Mitch Conner,"Come on, cheer up.
"
Cartman,"Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
"
Mitch Conner,"Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.
"
Cartman,"Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
"
Kyle,"You gotta be kidding me!
"
Mitch Conner,"Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew.  You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on.
"
Cartman,"Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
"
Mitch Conner,"There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
"
Cartman,"Take it easy, Conner. 
"
Stan,"Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
"
Tom Cruise,"I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.
"
Kyle,"Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
"
Stan,"We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!
"
Tom Cruise,"You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh.  Oh please, can you show me where?
"
Stan,"We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.

Towelie,"Hey everybody, how's it goin'?
"
Towelie,"I just... I just can't seem to stop.
"
Towelie,"Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. 
"
Towelie,"Get out of my face! Get out of here! 
"
Towelie,"My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills.  And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways.  Except for one.  I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. 
"
Towelie,"Hey buddy, want your dick sucked?  Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?
"
Stan,"Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
"
Kyle,"If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
"
Butters,"Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!
"
Stan,"There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 
"
Singers,"Are you ready for the summer?
Are you ready for the good times?
Are you ready for the birds and bees?
The apple trees?
And a whole lot of fooling around?

"
Jimmy,"Oh boy, Timmy, it's our favorite time of year.
"
Timmy,"Timmeh!
"
Jimmy,"We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!
"
Frances,"Hi Jimmy, hi Tim.
"
Timmy,"Timmy.
"
Specialist 1,"Wow, look at Lenora everyone.  Good job. Come on, good job Lenora. Ahahall right, good, let's get Lenora a towel.  Come on, come on, where's the towel?
"
Specialist 2,"The towel isn't here. I think it's off getting high again.
"
Specialist 3,"Hey!  Where is that towel?!
"
Towelie,"Oh yeah, just a sec. 
"
Stan,"We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us!  Stupid towel!
"
Specialist 3,"What's going on, Towel?
"
Towelie,"Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
"
Specialist 3,"We got wet campers down there! Move your ass!
"
Kyle,"When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
"
Towelie,"I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. 
"
Jimmy,"Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition.
"
Jimmy,"All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
"
Blue Team,"Yeah!
"
Timmy,"Timmy!
"
Blue Team,"Yeah!  Alright!
"
Nathan,"I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl.
"
Mimsy,"Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha.
"
Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsssyyy!
"
Mimsy,"Doh, sorry, boss.
"
Nathan,"Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
"
Nathan,"What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete.
"
Mimsy,"Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?
"
Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him.
"
Specialist 1,"There you go, Lenora, all better now?
"
Lenora,"Yes, thanks.
"
Towelie,"That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... 
"
Lenora,"Uhhh!
"
Specialist 3,"Who hired that towel? It can barely walk, let alone dry somebody off.
"
Towelie,"You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
"
Stan,"A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
"
Towelie,"You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! 
"
Butters,"The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
"
Towelie,"Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!
"
Towelie,"No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!  Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
"
Specialist 1,"All right, campers! Our first event is the big canoe race!
"
Nathan,"I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good.
"
Mimsy,"Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?
"
Nathan,"Simple, Mimsy,  We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe.
"
Mimsy,"Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh?  Oh! It's a snake.
"
Nathan,"Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a black mamba.
"
Mimsy,"Aww, dah, jee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? 
"
Specialist 4,"You boys excited for the canoe race?
"
Nathan,"Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe.
"
Specialist 4,"Canoes are fun, aren't day? 
"
Nathan,"Now take the Black Mamba,  Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready.
"
Specialist 1,"All right, campers are we ready?
"
All,"Yeah!
"
Nathan,"Good luck, Jimmy.
"
Jimmy,"You too, Ne-n-Nathan.
"
Nathan,"You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole.
"
Specialist 1,"Oh your mark, get set. 
"
Nathan,"Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!
"
Mimsy,"Darrr, you set to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss.
"
Nathan,"Not in our canoe, Mimsy!
"
Steve,"Heeey. Hey, we need a towel! 
"
Towelie,"Uh, oh, um, uh, just a sec!
"
Steve,"Not just a sec! We've got a whole lot of wet campers down there!  What's going on?! 
"
Towelie,"Hey, you own me money, asshole!
"
Specialist 1,"That's it, we're done! You are no longer employed here!
"
Kyle,"Please, sir.
"
Specialist 1,"We need a nice, clean towel here at summer camp. We don't need a towel that shoots heroin and has sex for money!
"
Towelie,"Heh, some people are so picky about their towels
"
Specialist 3,"All right campers, next event is the big scavenger hunt! Blue Team is gonna go first. 
"
Nathan,"I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team.
"
Mimsy,"Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh buss?
"
Nathan,"Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans.  Here, take this.  It's a fake scavenger hunt map
"
Mimsy,"Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?
"
Nathan,"No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation.
"
Mimsy,"Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? 
"
Counselor Steve,"Are you boys excited for the neat scavenger hunt?
"
Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt.  Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!
"
Mimsy,"I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map. 
"
Mimsy,"Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?
"
Nathan,"Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too.
"
Mimsy,"Dahhhoh boy!
"
Nathan,"This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. ""Turn left at the..."" Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the?  Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!
"
Mimsy,"Why sure it is, boss.
"
Nathan,"I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
"
Mimsy,"No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. 
"
Nathan,"Miiimmmssssyyyy!  Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled.  AAAAA!
"
Towelie,"Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. 
"
Cashier,"You must have one dusty computer.
"
Towelie,"Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch!  I feel like I could conquer the world.
"
Towelie,"It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.
"
Butters,"I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
"
Towelie,"Go away! I'm walking on sunshine!
"
Butters,"Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
"
Towelie,"Jus', just let me walk on the sunshine a little more. 
"
Specialist 1,"All right! In the surfing competition, the Red Team is up three points to two.  And now it's Jimmy Valmer's turn. 
"
Timmy,"Timmeh!
"
Frances,"Gee, I wish our team captain was as awesome as Jimmy. 
"
Nathan,"I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can get rid of Jimmy once and for all.
"
Mimsy,"Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?
"
Nathan,"Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark.  Here, take this.  It's a shark-mating whistle.
"
Mimsy,"Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'
"
Nathan,"No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf.
"
Mimsy,"Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off.  Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. 
"
Steve,"Are you boys enjoying the fun beach?
"
Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. The beach is warm. 
"
Mimsy,"Gee that was a close one, huh boss? They almost had me saying we were gonna kill Jimmy.
"
Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just swim in the water where Jimmy is, then blow that whistle.
"
Mimsy,"Dohh boy! 
"
Timmy,"Timmih.
"
Jimmy,"Gonna catch a wave... 
"
Mimsy,"Dahhh I got me a shark whistle.
"
Jimmy,"Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! 
"
Mimsy,"Dohoho, oh boy!
"
Nathan,"Mimsy, you didn't do wha' I told you.
"
Mimsy,"Dahh whattaya mean, boss? You said to swim in the water and to blow the whistle. I swam in the water, so now I'm gonna blow the whistle. 
"
Nathan,"You fucking idiot! You don't blow a shark mating whistle on dry land! You were supposed to blow it-  eh uh uh...
"
Nathan,"Mimsssyyy! Get this thing off of meee!
"
Stan,"Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
"
Butters,"Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
"
Towelie,"Wha' what's goin' on?
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"You wanna come over, have a seat with your friends? 
"
Towelie,"What is everybody doing here?
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"We've all just been talking, Towelie, and and what I'm hearing is a bunch of people here who just love the heck outtaya. And, they're gonna way what they wanna say, and you're gonna say what you wanna say, and we're done. Okay?
"
Butters,"Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
"
Towelie,"Aw Jesus, man.
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"Ah ah Towelie, you need to let him finish.
"
Butters,"You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
"
Towelie,"I I don't, I don't get this.
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
"
Towelie,"Could we just end this please?
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"You have to let him finish, Towelie.
"
Kyle,"If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"Alright. Eric, do you wanna go next?
"
Cartman,"Kyle, I hate you so much. You are a liar and a swindler who would do anything for money, and I-.
"
Kyle,"We're here for Towelie, fatass!
"
Cartman,"I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
"
Kyle,"This is serious, you fucking asshole!
"
Cartman,"I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"Kyle, we have to let people be allowed to finish during interventions.
"
Kyle,"But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"Kyle please, It is not your turn!
"
Cartman,"You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
"
Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
Jimmy,"It's a snap at Tardicaca Camp to learn to do the hula hula danceI fell in love with a Tardicaca dove while doin' that funny funny dance.And that poor little kid, why she never did know what love had in store.So I made up my mind-
"
Nathan,"Get ready, Mimsy. Blue Team is about to go boom.
"
Jimmy,"So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.
"
Campers,"Wawawawander...
"
Jimmy,"Hurr a little Tardicaca...
"
Campers,"Hula...
"
Jimmy,"She's a candy cane to wiggle
"
Campers,"Hula...
"
Jimmy,"She's sure to make you g-giggle.
"
Campers,"Hula...
"
Jimmy,"With her naughty little wiggle. I know someday
"
Campers,"Hula...
"
Jimmy,"I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!
Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. '
"
Mimsy,"Dahh I don't think he's playing the right note, boss. The C4 aint gonna go off.
"
Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsssyyy!
"
Cartman,"If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"Okay, Stan, you want to go next?
"
Stan,"Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
"
Towel,"What treatment?! What are you all talkin' about?!
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"If you say yes, we leave here, pack your things, get on a plane, go to a treatment facility in Southern California, it's all set up.
"
Towelie,"No! Fuck no! I'm not gettin' on, no fucking plane! This is bullshit! Don't give me fuckin' ultimatums! I thought you were my fuckin' friends.
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"Well Towelie, your friends don't wanna watch you kill yourself anymore.
"
Towelie,"Then fuck them! You're tellin' me I have to do this? Uh, I'm not left with any decisions here! 
"
Butters,"Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
"
Towelie,"Who are you talkin' about?!  Washcloth? You, you brought Washcloth?! Oh, that's low.
"
Jimmy,"Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so highHolding her hand, our feet on the sand-
"
Nathan,"Dammit dammit!
"
Nathan,"Mimsy, get out there and demand the ukulele solo. It's our only chance.
"
Mimsy,"Dahh okay boss. 
"
Jimmy,"If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-
"
Mimsy,"Darrr we want the ukulele solo! We want the ukulele solo!
"
Jimmy,"Sorry Mims, I I just can't remember it.
"
Mimsy,"Well we wants ya to play it, don't we?
"
Nathan,"Yeeeah!
"
Jimmy,"Alright Mimsy, m-maybe you can show me how it's done. 
"
Mimsy,"Dahh okay. It's real easy. You just play it like this. 
"
Nathan,"Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'?
"
Mimsy,"D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss.
"
Nathan,"That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself!  AAAAAAAA!
"
Nathan,"Uuuh!  AAAH!  No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!
"
Towelie,"Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry.
"
Butters,"He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"You've got so many people that just love the heck out of ya, Towelie. 
"
Towelie,"All right. All right, I'll go.
"
Butters,"You will?
"
Towelie,"I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore.
"
Jeff VanVonderen,"He's goin', everybody. Hugs! 
"
Jimmy,"Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ.
"
Nathan,"I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being.
"
Mimsy,"Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss.
"
Nathan,"Shut up... Mimsssyyy. 
"
Counselor,"Hi, Towelie?
"
Towelie,"Yeah, hi.
"
Counselor,"Towelie is definitely one of the most addicted towels we've ever seen here. He's probably the second most psychologically damaged towel I've come across since treating Kirstie Alley's towel, which, had seen some... uuff, some nasty stuff.
"
Towelie,"I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel.
"
Singer,"Veins swell
You know me, Ellen
Enough to tell
Five steps, you're over
"
Stan,"Cartman, dude, what's wrong?
"
Cartman,"Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?
"
Kyle,"Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
"
Cartman,"It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"
Kyle,"""What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up""?
"
Cartman,"I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! 
"
Stan,"Why not?
"
Cartman,"Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
"
Stan,"Cartman, tell us.
"
Cartman,"No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
"
Stan,"Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
"
Cartman,"Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
"
Kyle,"Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
"
Cartman,"No I can't; I'll always be like this. 
"
Stan,"Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
"
Cartman,"Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Cartman,"I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!
"
Stan,"Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!
"
Cartman,"Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
"
Kenny,"(What?)
"
Cartman,"You love NASCAR huh?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)
"
Cartman,"You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
"
Kyle,"Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
"
Cartman,"I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. 
"
Stan,"Dude, you are so retarded!
"
Cartman,"Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
"
Kyle,"How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
"
Cartman,"You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
"
Kyle,"I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
"
Cartman,"Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 
"
Cartman,"Butters.
"
Butters,"Hey Eric.
"
Cartman,"Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
"
Butters,"Ahhh well oh- kay.
"
Cartman,"But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
"
Butters,"Eeyeah, I'm psyched.
"
Cartman,"Get really psyched up, Butters!
"
Butters,"I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
"
Cartman,"I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
"
Butters,"NASCA- NASCAR?
"
Cartman,"I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
"
Butters,"You're givin' away all your money??
"
Cartman,"Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
"
Butters,"You sure you want to do this?
"
Cartman,"I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
"
Spokesman,"Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah! How cool!)
"
Spokesman,"How who's ready for Saturday's big race? 
"
Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
Spokesman,"We're really excited to be part of the fastest-growing sport in America! 
"
Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
Spokesman,"I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled to watch NASCAR finally becoming recognized as a respected, legitimate sport. 
"
Kenny,"(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)
"
Butters,"Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
"
Man 1,"Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats.  I just wish I had brought an umbrella.
"
Butters,"Hey Eric.
"
Cartman,"Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
"
Butters,"Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
"
Cartman,"I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
"
Charlie,"Hey- hey, there's a hot girl over there. 
"
Jake,"Sure she's hot. She's wearing a sweater. 
"
Butters,"Feel stupid yet?
"
Cartman,"Not yet.
"
Woman 1,"When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-
"
Cartman,"Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!
"
Woman 1,"To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors.
"
Cartman,"Fucking gross!
"
Butters,"All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
"
Woman 1,"If you develop an allergic reaction, see your doctor. In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.
"
Woman 2,"For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do.
"
Cartman,"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.""  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!
"
Cartman,"""Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes.""
"
Butters,"Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings.
"
Cartman,"Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
"
Butters,"Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
"
Cartman,"I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
"
Butters,"But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
"
Cartman,"Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
"
Butters,"No, you're good. 
"
Cartman,"Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
"
Woman 3,"Little boy, what are you doing? 
"
Cartman,"Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
"
Butters,"Really?
"
Cartman,"Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
"
Butters,"That was fast.
"
Cartman,"Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
"
Announcer,"We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300. 
"
Butters,"Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir?  Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped.
"
Dale,"What?
"
Butters,"Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
"
Dale,"Oh my God! 
"
Cartman,"Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! 
"
Butters,"Eric, are you sure you can do this?
"
Cartman,"Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
"
Announcer,"Let the race begin!
"
Cartman,"Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.
"
Butters,"I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
"
Cartman,"What's that?
"
Butters,"There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
"
Cartman,"Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 
"
Announcer,"It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!
"
Cartman,"Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 
"
Cartman,"Oh, fuck my ass! 
"
Butters,"Eric?
"
Cartman,"All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
"
Butters,"Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
"
Cartman,"Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
"
Butters,"Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
"
Cartman,"I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
"
Doctor,"Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back.
"
Butters,"How bad is it, doctor?
"
Doctor,"He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a lever 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean.
"
Butters,"Well at least there's that.
"
Cartman,"Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this.
"
Doctor,"You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.
"
Cartman,"Aw donkey balls...
"
Doctor,"You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing! 
"
Cartman,"Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
"
Doctor,"No, really. Of all the idiotic dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake! 
"
Butters,"Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
"
Cartman,"Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
"
Butters,"It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
"
Cartman,"Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 
"
FOX 11 Anchor,"You're watching Colorado FOX 11. Next on FOX 11 News, are NASCAR fans stupid?  Some people are starting to wonder after a NASCAR fan apparently got high on Vagisil and snuck onto the track, killing eleven people.
"
Reporter,"Tom, the NASCAR fan got into a car here on Sunday and crashed in the lake behind me. He was later found to have ingested this  Maximum Strength Vagisil. And also Vagisil medicated wipes. Making NASCAR fans look ...pretty stupid, Tom.
"
Kenny,"(No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)
"
Reporter,"The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win.
"
Kenny,"(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
"
Cartman,"Oh hey, Kenny.
"
Kenny,"(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)
"
Cartman,"Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
"
Kenny,"(Dude, fuck you!)
"
Cartman,"Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
"
Kenny,"(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
"
Cartman,"Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!
"
Kenny,"(No you fucking don't!)
"
Cartman,"Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!
"
Kenny,"(What?!)
"
Cartman,"I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
"
Man,"Uh, excuse me.  Eric Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Yeah?
"
Man,"My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.
"
Cartman,"...Uh oh.
"
Geoff Hamill,"Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you. 
"
Cartman,"Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
"
Geoff Hamill,"Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.
"
Cartman,"Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
"
Kenny,"(No fucking way!)
"
Geoff Hamill,"And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
"
Cartman,"Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
"
Announcer,"We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters.
"
Reporter 1,"So uh what's your guys' take on the track here? Any concerns? 
"
Jimmie Johnson,"Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-
"
Cartman,"Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
"
Reporter 2,"Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake plate problems?
"
Jeff Gordon,"Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-
"
Cartman,"Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
"
"Dale Earnhardt, Jr.","Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?
"
Cartman,"Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
"
Danica Patrick,"Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?
"
Cartman,"Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!
"
Butters,"You seemed really stupid, Eric.
"
Cartman,"Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
"
Tony Kornheiser,"Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast.
"
Cartman,"Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
"
Butters,"Obama's fuckin' gay.
"
Cartman,"He's fuckin' gay as hell!
"
Butters,"Pissin' me off!
"
Cartman,"So you all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!
"
Tony Kornheiser,"Well if you ask me, that's all the proof we need that NASCAR really is just for the poor...  and the stupid.
"
Kenny,"(Fuck this!) 
"
Commentator 1,"The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year.
"
Commentator 2,"Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill.
"
Geoff,"Thank you, Chris.
"
Chris,"Yeah, but why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?
"
Geoff,"Vagisil is very excited to be a part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks.
"
Commentator 1,"Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track?
"
Announcer,"Gentlemen, start your engines! 
"
Cartman,"Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean?
"
Pit Crewman,"That means you flip the switch that says ""Engine.""  Is he stupid or what?
"
Butters,"Yeah, he's a champion alright.
"
Security Guard,"Check your bag please, sir?  No, no, see, this won't do. You can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track.
"
Kenny,"(Aww, come on!)
"
Security Guard,"Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name!
"
Kenny,"(Aw come on, fuck you!) 
"
Security Guard,"You might be able to buy one in the gift shop. 
"
Announcer,"The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.
"
Cartman,"Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
"
Pit Crewman,"This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 
"
Danica Patrick,"The fuck are you doing?!
"
Cartman,"Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 
"
Danica Patrick,"Oh, son of a bitch!
"
Cartman,"Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
"
Commentator 1,"And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race.
"
Chris,"Yes, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?
"
Geoff Hamill,"Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day,  Every. Day.  Every. Day.  And available nationwide.
"
Butters,"Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, I see it. 
"
Danica Patrick,"AAAAAA! 
"
Cartman,"You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
"
Butters,"That's fuckin' gay as hell.
"
Cartman,"Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
"
Butters,"There you go. You're back on the track.
"
Cartman,"I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
"
Kenny,"(Stop this car!)
"
Cartman,"Get off my car, Kenny!
"
Kenny,"(Stop this car right now!)
"
Butters,"Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
"
Cartman,"We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
"
Kenny,"(I fucking hate you!)
"
Cartman,"Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
"
Kenny,"(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) 
"
Driver,"Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. 
"
Chris,"Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill.
"
Geoff Hamill,"This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently.  Very. Diligently.  Patty? Patty?
"
Announcer,"It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car. 
"
Geoff Hamill,"What? 
"
Lowes Pit Boss,"Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous.
"
Geoff Hamill,"Let me talk to her.  Patty? Patty, what are you doing?  Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty? 
"
Cartman,"Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
"
Butters,"I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
"
Cartman,"Fuckin' gay as hell. 
"
Geoff Hamill,"Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame.
"
Announcer,"They are neck and neck approaching the finish line. 
"
Cartman,"Oh, fuck my ass again! 
"
Geoff Hamill,"HAAAAAAAAAA!
"
Announcer,"Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.
"
Geoff Hamill,"Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!
"
Kenny,"(HA! You fucking lose!)
"
Cartman,"No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Cartman,"The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
"
Butters,"Uh, but- but you- you said I had to  s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- 
"
Cartman,"Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
"
Butters,"But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
"
Kyle,"Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""? 
"
Gerald,"Muff cabbage?
"
Sheila,"Where did you hear that?
"
Ike,"Muff cabbage!
"
Kyle,"The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage"".
"
Ike,"Muff cabbage.
"
Sheila,"A new family moved in? Where are they from?
"
Kyle,"She said they're from New Jersey.
"
Sheila,"New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
"
Sheila,"Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?
"
Kyle,"Know what, Ma?
"
Ike,"Muff cabbage!
"
Sheila,"Never invite a New Jersey housewife in your home.
"
Teresa,"And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!
"
Teresa,"Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me.
"
Teresa,"Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
"
Sharon,"Oh, Linda, huh?
"
Teresa,"Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage!  I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you have a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!
"
Joe,"So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?
"
Randy,"I don't really work out.
"
Joe,"Well, I gotta find somethin'.  My biceps are goin' flat.
"
Teresa,"Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?
"
Sharon,"Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah.
"
Teresa,"Ears out to here!  So I tell her, ""You got big ears, sweetie."" I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections.
"
Sharon,"Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. 
"
Teresa,"That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No.
"
Teresa,"You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution...  ...whore! You probably sell your muff...  ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you!  You're nothin' but garbage!  That's what you are! You're garbage!  You sick, old woman! Muff garbage!  Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!
"
Sharon,"Wow.
"
Teresa,"Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! Okay, I love you.
"
Joe,"Take it easy.
"
Teresa,"I love you.  I love you.
"
Teresa,"I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am.  Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine.
"
Teresa,"Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Me!
"
Stan,"You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
"
Cartman,"You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep.
"
Kyle,"Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
"
Cartman,"Oops, busted. 
"
Stan,"They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, ""Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing.""
"
Jersey Man,"Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey.
"
Cartman,"Aw, crap, there's more of them?
"
Jersey Man,"'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey? 
"
"Steve ""Last Call""","So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, ""Who's from Jersey?"", and people are all like, ""Yo! Woo-hoo!"" Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler. 
"
Woman,"Yeah, let's get this party started. 
"
Kyle,"Where the hell are they coming from?! 
"
Teresa,"Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
"
Woman 1,"Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!
"
Teresa,"I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage!  Oh, Sharon!  Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey.
"
Jacqueline,"And Sicilian.
"
Teresa,"That's Danielle. She's from Jersey.  And that's Caroline.
"
Caroline,"I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.
"
Salon Girl,"I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down? 
"
Jacqueline,"When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit.
"
Teresa,"Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
"
Caroline,"Teresa! Calm down.
"
Salon Girl,"I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!
"
Teresa,"Get her, Sharon!
"
Sharon,"What?
"
Jacqueline,"Sharon, just stay out of it!
"
Caroline,"Be the bigger person, Sharon!
"
Sharon,"You people are crazy.
"
Caroline,"Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?!  Is my family crazy?!
"
Teresa,"Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch! 
"
Sheila,"Let go of her, you piece of trash! 
"
Teresa,"Who the fuck are you to tell me what to do?!
"
Sheila,"All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
"
Teresa,"Psycho bitch!
"
Sheila,"No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho bitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! 
"
Jacqueline,"You're cabbage! 
"
Sharon,"Sheila?
"
Randy,"People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Jesus! Why are they doing this?
"
Randy,"More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
"
Jimbo,"Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!
"
All,"Yeah!
"
Sheila,"That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool.
"
Jimbo,"How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? 
"
Sheila,"That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey.  Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang.  I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face.  Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey.  I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or, somehow, you know, hold it against me.
"
Sharon,"Sheila, who are you talking to?
"
Sheila,"You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. 
"
Cartman,"You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!
"
Kyle,"Hey, dudes.
"
Cartman,"Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
"
Kyle,"What are you talking about?
"
Cartman,"Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!
"
Kyle,"So what?
"
Cartman,"So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
"
Kyle,"No, it doesn't!
"
Cartman,"He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
"
Kyle,"I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
"
Cartman,"Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!
"
Kyle,"What's strike three?!
"
Cartman,"You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
"
Kyle,"Shut the fuck up!  What?
"
Stan,"Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
"
Kyle,"Why does it matter?!
"
Stan,"No, uh, it just explains a lot.
"
Cartman,"Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
"
Kyle,"No, it isn't!
"
Cartman,"Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
"
Stan,"Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
Cartman,"Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you.  And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!
"
Kyle,"No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.
"
Sheila,"Kyle? You in there?
"
Kyle,"Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. 
"
Sheila,"Kyle, open the door.
"
Kyle,"Not now, Mom. Please.
"
Sheila,"Kyle, this instant! One, two. 
"
Kyle,"All right, all right. 
"
Sheila,"I guess we need to talk.
"
Sheila,"I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"What am I, Mom?
"
Sheila,"When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus.
"
Kyle,"What are you saying?!
"
Sheila,"I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey.
"
Kyle,"No! I don't wanna look like this!
"
Sheila,"It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice.
"
Ike,"Aaaahhhhh! 
"
Kyle,"I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
"
Announcer,"Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the ""Jersey News"" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!
"
P-Train,"What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago.
"
Reporter,"People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out.  And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops!  It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!
"
Tan Jovi,"What's up with that?!
"
P-Train,"What's up with that?!
"
Tan Jovi,"Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!
"
Randy,"Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
"
Schwarzenegger,"We are very sorry, but California cannot afford helping you at this time.
"
Randy,"Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
"
Schwarzenegger,"No, because Utah is between Colorado and California.
"
Randy,"Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
"
Schwarzenegger,"Nevada.
"
Randy,"Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
"
Cartman,"What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
Stan,"Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
"
Cartman,"And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
"
Kyle,"I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
"
Cartman,"Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!
"
Kyle,"That's enough!
"
Cartman,"Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
"
Kyle,"Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
"
Cartman,"That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
"
Randy,"Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people!  Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month!  That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!
"
Stuart,"We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
"
Randy,"There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
"
Mr. Garrison,"What are you talking about?
"
Randy,"We could ask Al Qaeda.
"
Stephen,"Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
"
Randy,"Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
"
Stephen,"And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!
"
Bar Patron 1,"Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bad quick! There's trouble!
"
Randy,"People from Jersey?
"
Bar Patron 1,"I don't know what the hell I saw.
"
Skeeter,"It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed a cigarette machine in half.
"
Barbrady,"Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. 
"
Bar Patron 2,"It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! 
"
Randy,"What is it?
"
Bar Patron 2,"It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. 
"
Randy,"That thing is famous? Why?
"
Bar Patron 2,"I don't know!
"
Jimbo,"Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! 
"
Snooki,"Snooki.
"
Randy,"Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 
"
Stephen,"Aaagh! Get it off of me!
"
Snooki,"Snooki smoosh.
"
Stephen,"Shoot it! 
"
Cartman,"So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open.
"
Butters,"Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
"
Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
"
Butters,"Are you being serious?
"
Cartman,"This is very serious, Butters.
"
Butters,"Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die.
"
Cartman,"Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
"
Operative,"Istagia makuman? 
"
Randy,"Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 
"
Snooki,"Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
"
Cartman,"Come on, you guys, hurry!
"
Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?
"
Cartman,"I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
"
Kenny,"(What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) 
"
Cartman,"Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
"
Kyle,"Why?
"
Cartman,"Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
"
Kyle,"You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
"
Cartman,"Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
"
Kyle,"I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
"
Cartman,"Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 
"
Stan,"Dude, what are you doing?
"
Cartman,"Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
"
Kyle,"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
"
Cartman,"Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!
"
Kyle,"No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
"
Cartman,"You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!
"
Snooki,"Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
"
Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
"
Stephen,"Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?
"
Mr. Garrison,"He's still questioning that new prisoner.
"
Randy,"Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
"
The Situation,"Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. 
"
Randy,"What does that mean?!
"
The Situation,"You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. 
"
Randy,"Stop playing stupid!
"
Jimbo,"Maybe he really is stupid, Randy.
"
Randy,"Nobody's this stupid!  What are you people planning?!
"
The Situation,"It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it. 
"
Gerald,"Here they come! 
"
Sharon,"Is it them, Randy?
"
Randy,"Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
"
Jersey People,"Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!
"
Jersey Man 2,"Let's go creepin' in this town!
"
Jersey Woman,"Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!
"
Randy,"This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
"
Randy,"Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
"
DogPoo,"Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
"
Snooki,"Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
"
Stan,"Try to find a way past it!
"
Cartman,"What does it want?!
"
Butters,"Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
"
Snooki,"Smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
"
Cartman,"No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
"
Stan,"Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?
"
Kyle,"Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
"
Stan,"Why? 
"
Kyle,"Agggh! Agggh!  No! 
"
Stan,"Dude.
"
Kyle,"Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
"
Snooki,"Snooki just, uh, smoosh in the... the tenth...
"
Kyle,"You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
"
Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle.
"
Jimbo,"That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
"
Randy,"Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
"
Stuart,"What's the point? Can't you see it's over? 
"
Jimbo,"Who is that?! 
"
Randy,"It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 
"
Randy,"On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, ""Go away!"" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. 
"
Stan,"Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
"
Stan,"I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage?
"
Kyle,"It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
"
Randy,"On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 
"
Paratrooper,"Tango is down, tango is down.
"
Randy,"We got him!
"
Cartman,"So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
"
Butters,"Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
"
Stan,"A note?
"
Butters,"Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
"
Kyle,"What's it say?
"
Stan,"We need to talk.
"
Cartman,"Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says ""We need to talk"" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude.
"
Red,"Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?
"
Wendy,"Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called ""hoarding."" People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
"
Stan,"Is something wrong, Wendy? 
"
Wendy,"Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
"
Stan,"My locker?
"
Wendy,"Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
"
Stan,"Are you serious?
"
Wendy,"It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
"
Stan,"Well it's just a little messy.
"
Wendy,"No, Stan, it's called ""hoarding""! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!
"
Stan,"Aw come on.
"
Wendy,"Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
"
Stan,"Yeah, alright.
"
Wendy,"Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.
"
An Expert,"Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan. 
"
Stan,"What, come on, it's not that bad.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.
"
Stan,"My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Okay, great. How about we start with this? 
"
Stan,"Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this?  Broken toothbrush.
"
Stan,"Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"But it's broken.
"
Stan,"Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box.  Now how about this?  Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.
"
Class,"Eeeeewwww! 
"
Stan,"Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?
"
Stan,"Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?
"
Stan,"Well, I- I guess so, but-  Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? 
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?
"
Stan,"Well no, don't throw that out.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? 
"
Stan,"No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
"
Kyle,"Dude. What's wrong with you?
"
Stan,"I don't... I don't know.
"
Kyle,"Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? 
"
Stan,"Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... ""hoarding.""
"
Mr. Mackey,"Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?
"
Stan,"Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?
"
Stan,"Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Me? ...Like, like what?
"
Stan,"Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-
"
Mr. Mackey,"DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3.
"
Principal Victoria,"But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
"
Sharon,"Yeah, our son has always been fairly clean.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them.
"
Sharon,"Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is.  It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.
"
Randy,"Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Oh no, really?
"
Sgt. Yates,"Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.
"
Mr. Yelman,"...Well I, that is I, I-
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. 
"
Partner,"Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.
"
Mr. Yelman,"Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"It's pronounced ""hoarder,"" and yes you are.
"
Mr. Yelman,"But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Yes, you are herding sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that.
"
Mr. Yelman,"No, but I just thought that-
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uhkay?
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... Light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. Float-  WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!
"
Mr. Mackey,"What?! What?! Jesus, what?!
"
Mr. Yelman,"Oh my God!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second.  Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... Now the cloud is near you. You... you reach out to it.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay...
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"It's the cloud of your memories, of your past.  Your childhood perhaps. What do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Billy. Billy Thompson?
"
Billy,"There he is! Hey, Mackey! 
"
Mackey,"Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?
"
Billy,"Come 'ere! 
"
Mackey,"Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh...
"
Billy,"You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.
"
Mackey,"Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay?  Huhhhhh!
"
Billy,"You're gonna die Mackey!  Hold his legs!  Come back here!
"
Mackey,"Okay. Okay, okay okay, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light. 
"
Stan,"What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?
"
Mackey,"Shh. Be quiet.
"
Mr. Yelman,"'Scuse me, where are we?
"
Mackey,"Shh. You've goota be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.
"
Stan,"What the hell's going on?!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"What the hell is going on?!
"
Partner,"The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Oh Jesus.
"
Randy,"What does that mean?
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.
"
Randy,"What?!
"
Partner,"I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.
"
Randy,"Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background.
"
Pinkerton,"Alright.  Look, it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams.  Send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who's dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back. 
"
Mackey,"Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?
"
Stan,"Mr. Mackey.
"
Mackey,"Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay.
"
Stan,"Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?
"
Mackey,"Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay.
"
Stan,"Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
"
Mackey,"Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll!  I can take the motorcycle, hm'kay, I put it on this thing, like this.  Okay now crank it back, and now I let go.  Okay. Okay.
"
Stan,"Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
"
Mackey,"Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!
"
Mr. Yelman,"Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.
"
Stan,"I'm working on it!
"
Mackey,"Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay!
"
Stan,"Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! 
"
Billy,"You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is a field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!
"
Mackey,"No, uh Billy, please, ukay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh.
"
Billy,"See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! 
"
Mackey,"Oh Jesus...
"
Stan,"Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
"
Mackey,"Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay. 
"
Stan,"Ohhhhhhh.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.
"
Randy,"What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen.
"
Randy,"That does it! 
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"What are you doing?!
"
Randy,"I'm goin' in!  If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!
"
Randy,"Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!
"
Randy,"I said get me in there!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine!  You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it.
"
Randy,"Ahhh.
"
Bus Driver,"Alright kids, everyone on the bus.
"
Stan,"Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
"
Mackey,"It's the day of the big field trip.
"
Billy,"Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya.
"
Mackey,"Oh Jesus.
"
Stan,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
"
Bus Driver,"Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!
"
Mr. Yelman,"Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder.
"
Driver,"It's pronounced ""hoarder,"" young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! 
"
Mr. Yelman,"Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um.
"
Stan,"Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey.
"
Randy,"Stan?  Stan!
"
Stan,"Dad? Is that you?
"
Randy,"Yes, it's me, Stan.
"
Stan,"Where are you?
"
Randy,"It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!
"
Stan,"The hell are you doing, dad?
"
Randy,"I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
"
Stan,"Did you come here to help me?
"
Randy,"I was gonna, but oh! This is fun!
"
Stan,"Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
"
Randy,"Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
"
Stan,"DAD!
"
Randy,"Aah ahhh aha ahhh.
"
Stan,"Aaaaaagh!
"
Pinkerton,"Uh oh, something's wrong.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"What is it?!
"
Pinkerton,"The father. He's gone completely off chart.
"
Sharon,"Off chart? What does that mean?
"
Pinkerton,"We don't even know.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.
"
Sharon,"Who are the experts? 
"
Leonardo DiCaprio,"Get that door closed! Keep me covered! 
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Ah good, you're here.
"
DiCaprio,"What's the sitch?!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream.
"
Expert 1,"We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!
"
Sharon,"What next dream level?
"
DiCaprio,"Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream.  We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream.
"
Sharon,"Why?
"
Expert 1,"Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo.
"
Sharon,"What's that?
"
Expert 2,"Empty scary dreamspace.
"
Sharon,"So like a nightmare?
"
Expert 3,"No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!
"
Sharon,"Why can't you wake up from that?
"
Expert 1,"You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!
"
Sharon,"That doesn't sound very difficult.
"
Expert 1,"It is!
"
Sharon,"Why?
"
Expert 4,"Arrgh.
"
Expert 1,"We don't have time for this!
"
Sharon,"Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?
"
Expert 1,"Then we go into your husband's dream!
"
Sharon,"Okaaay...
"
DiCaprio,"But your husband will think we're in Hasselback's dream.
"
Sharon,"Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?
"
Hasselback,"I am.
"
Sharon,"Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?
"
DiCaprio,"Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!
"
Sharon,"Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
"
DiCaprio,"Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time.
"
Expert 1,"It's so complex and cool.
"
Sharon,"Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
"
DiCaprio,"You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move! 
"
Sharon,"Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it.
"
Sharon,"Why?
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Because.
"
Ranger Pete,"Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete.
"
Class,"Hi Ranger Pete.
"
Mackey,"Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay.
"
Ranger Pete,"Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.
"
Mackey,"Oh that should be fun, m'kay.  Ahhhh...
"
Ranger Pete,"But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl. 
"
Mackey,"Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!
"
Stan,"Who's that?
"
Mackey,"""Give a hoot, don't pollute,"" m'kay.
"
Woodsy Owl,"Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,
"
Mackey,"Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay.  Oh, boy I love that song.
"
Ranger Pete,"Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six.
"
Billy,"We wanna be in Mackey's group!
"
Mackey,"Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh.
"
Ranger Pete,"That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.
"
Mackey,"Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay? 
"
DiCaprio,"Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?
"
Expert 2,"I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!
"
DiCaprio,"Oh well. Just keep shooting!
"
Stan,"What the fuck?
"
An Expert,"Mommy? Mommy?
"
Fire Captain,"So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream?
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn.
"
Fireman 1,"Well, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?
"
Pinkerton,"It's very simple: You see,  when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream.
"
Fireman 1,"Like a taco within a taco?
"
Fire Captain,"A double-decker taco supreme.
"
Pinkerton,"Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams.
"
Fire Captain,"Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream? 
"
Pinkerton,"Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.
"
Pizza Man,"Somebody order a pizza?
"
Pinkerton,"No.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Probably one of them in the dream.
"
Pizza Man,"Alright, I'm goin' in. 
"
Pinkerton,"Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN! 
"
Mackey,"Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!
"
Stan,"Mr. Mackey, stop running!
"
Mackey,"But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay!  They're gonna kick it bad!
"
Stan,"Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
"
Mackey,"I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay.
"
Billy,"There he is! You can't run forever!
"
Mackey,"Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god... 
"
Stan,"Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
"
Mr. Yelman,"But I literally herd sheep.
"
Stan,"Shut up!
"
Mackey,"Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?
"
Pizza Man,"Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?
"
Pinkerton,"Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Alright, that does it.  Get your coat.
"
Pinkerton,"Where are we going?
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.
"
Pinkerton,"You don't mean...
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Hello, Freddy.  You're looking healthy.
"
Freddy Krueger,"Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream.
"
Freddy Krueger,"Told you a long time ago: I gave that up. 
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"There's some good men stuck in there.
"
Freddy Krueger,"I said I'm done with it! 
"
Woman,"Everything all right, Fred?
"
Freddy Krueger,"It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house. 
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Wife and kids.
"
Freddy Krueger,"No thanks to you.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"We need ya Fred.
"
Freddy Krueger,"Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"We had a country to protect!
"
Freddy Krueger,"Protect it yourselves this time.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!
"
Freddy Krueger,"Then you should have no problem covering it up. 
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this.
"
Freddy Krueger,"Alright, fine.
"
Mackey,"Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!
"
Billy,"You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! 
"
Stan,"You can do it Mr. Mackey.
"
Mackey,"Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?
"
Billy,"Alright Mackey. Take this. 
"
DiCaprio,"Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!
"
Stan,"What the hell?
"
Expert 2,"We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.
"
Fire Captain,"Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic.
"
Stan,"Who are you people?
"
DiCaprio,"We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.
"
Stan,"Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
"
Expert 1,"No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up.
"
Expert 2,"Right. 
"
Stan,"...Well then why aren't we waking up?
"
Expert 2,"Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.
"
Mackey,"Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them.
"
Expert 2,"Oh, whoops.
"
Mackey,"I remember.  I ran and I ran and I hid in this building here. And somebody was in there. Somebody who talked to me real nice and then... and then touched me somewhere bad. 
"
Real Mackey,"No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?
"
Mackey,"Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no! 
"
Fire Captain,"What's happening?
"
Expert 2,"Dream conundrum. This is bad. 
"
Fire Captain,"What the hell's going on?
"
DiCaprio,"The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed!  Our dream bullets don't hurt it. 
"
Mackey,"No! No more, Woodsy. 
"
Stan,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
"
Expert 1,"He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo! 
"
Freddy Krueger,"There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy! 
"
Mackey,"It's dead... It's finally dead. 
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.
"
Pinkerton,"They're waking up. They're coming to. 
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Ahhh, you're back, everyone! 
"
Randy,"Aw, dammit. 
"
Fire Captain,"Thanks, Freddy.
"
Freddy Krueger,"If only I could have saved the sheep herder.
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problem, Mr. Mackey?
"
Mr. Mackey,"I sure did.
"
DiCaprio,"Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl.
"
Mr. Mackey,"I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?
"
Fire Captain,"So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying ""Give a hoot, don't pollute"" and touching his penis with his wing?
"
Pinkerton,"Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool!
"
Dr. Chinstrap,"Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?
"
Stan,"I think I have a better idea.
"
Wendy,"Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
"
Stan,"Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
"
Kyle,"But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
"
Stan,"Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
"
Kyle,"How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
"
Coon,"My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening.  I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it.  Yes, Toolshed.
"
Toolshed,"Why do we have to be called ""Coon and Friends""?
"
Coon,"...What?
"
Toolshed,"We all fight crime together. How come we're just your ""friends""?
"
TupperWear,"Yeah. We wanna be called ""The Extreme Avenger League.""
"
All,"Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!
"
Coon,"I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work.
"
TupperWear,"Why not?
"
Coon,"It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.
"
Mosquito,"Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?
"
Coon,"Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!
"
Mosquito,"Have, so.
"
Coon,"Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city.  Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden.
"
Iron Maiden,"Timmeh!
"
Coon,"Let's work, people!  Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber?  Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean?  I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity.  Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume.
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Like milk?
"
Coon,"No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even- 
"
Alarm,"Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.
"
Coon,"Uh oh!  What's the alert, Mosquito?
"
Mosquito,"There's like a big fire or something in town.
"
Coon,"What? A fire? Coon volume up! 
"
News 4 Reporter,"There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck.
"
Coon,"My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!
"
Coon's Friends,"Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go! 
"
Coon,"Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl. 
"
Coon,"We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends!  Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!
"
Liane,"Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?
"
Coon,"Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!
"
Liane,"Well, all right.  I guess I can get some groceries anyway. 
"
Coon,"Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time! 
"
Liane,"All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?
"
Coon,"Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!
"
Liane,"Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!
"
Coon,"Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please?  Unbelievable! 
"
Fireman,"We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!
"
Fire Captain,"Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!
"
Liane,"Oh my goodness, it's a fire. 
"
Coon,"Come on, Coon Friends!
"
Liane,"No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!
"
Fire Captain,"Can we try a helicopter?
"
Fireman,"The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes. 
"
Coon,"All right, what seems to be the problem?
"
Fire Captain,"Get back, kids. It isn't safe.
"
Liane,"Eric, poopsie?
"
Coon,"Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!
"
Mosquito,"And friends!
"
Fire Captain,"Keep those children back, Thompson! 
"
Coon,"Please sir, you must let us-
"
Liane,"Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job.
"
Coon,"Shut! Up! Mom! God!
"
Officer,"Wait. Look! Up in the sky!
"
Fireman,"It's him! My God, it's really him!
"
Fire Captain,"He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight! 
"
Stan,"Who's Captain Hindsight?
"
Announcer,"Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age.  Once known as Jack Brolin, a reporter for the national news, the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight. From toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for... Captain Hindsight! 
"
Fire Captain,"Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!
"
Captain Hindsight,"What's the skinny?
"
Fireman,"There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it.
"
Fireman,"Yes, of course.
"
Captain Hindsight,"And then you see that building to the left?
"
Fire Captain,"Yes.
"
Captain Hindsight,"They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to.  Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone! 
"
Fireman,"Thank you, Captain Hindsight!
"
Officer,"Thank youuu!
"
Fire Captain,"All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up. 
"
Randy,"Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
"
Sharon,"Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died.
"
Randy,"It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
"
Sharon,"Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter.
"
Randy,"I mean, hello!
"
Stan,"Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
"
Randy,"Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. 
"
Alarm,"Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. 
"
Randy,"What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
"
Alarm: Alert.,"Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously.
"
Stan,"Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
"
Sharon,"Well sure, Stan.  Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?
"
Randy,"I don't know.
"
Sharon,"Well take it down. It's noisy.
"
Randy,"I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. 
"
Coon,"Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start.
"
Toolshed,"Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?
"
Mosquito,"Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it.
"
Coon,"The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.
"
TupperWear,"So what's the huge catastrophe?
"
Coon,"What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!
"
The Human Kite,"Yeah, so?
"
Coon,"So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!
"
Toolshed,"Oh Jesus...
"
Coon,"I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!
"
Professor Chaos,"Hey fellas?  Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days. 
"
Coon,"You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!
"
Professor Chaos,"Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now.  And I ain't got nothin' to eat.
"
Coon,"You've got poop, don'tcha?  Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends?
"
Mysterion,"Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
"
Coon,"I CARE!
"
Mysterion,"Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene.
"
Coon,"There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!
"
BP Man 1,"All right, this looks like a jolly good place.
"
BP Man 2,"Yes. Let's let her rip. 
"
BP Man 3,"That's it, lads. Collect that oil! 
"
BP Man 4,"Uh oh!  Oh deah.
"
BP Man 3,"Oh, don't tell me we did it again?
"
Alarm,"Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.  All Coon Friends report to base. I'm so seriously. Emergency. Coon and Friends alert. 
"
Coon,"Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up! 
"
Reporter,"It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile.
"
Man,"It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.
"
Woman,"Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
"
Cajun Shrimper,"Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!
"
Mysterion,"My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
"
The Human Kite,"We've got to help those people!
"
Coon,"Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor! 
"
Rescuer 1,"Wait a minute. Look! It's Captain Hindsight! 
"
Coon,"Oh no!
"
Captain Hindsight,"What seems to be the problem?
"
Rescuer 2,"It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned.
"
Rescuer 3,"If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?
"
Rescuer 3,"Yes.
"
Captain Hindsight,"It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!
"
Rescuer 2,"Aha!
"
Rescuer 4,"Yesss, YESSS.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke.
"
Rescuer 2,"I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!
"
Rescuer 5,"My God, he's right!
"
Captain Hindsight,"My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!
"
Rescuer 4,"God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!
"
Coon,"Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!
"
Butler,"Can I help you?
"
Cartman,"I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
"
Butler,"Yes?
"
Cartman,"I need to speak with him, please.
"
Butler,"The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.
"
Cartman,"I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
"
Butler,"Mr. Hindsight, sir.  This young man would like a word.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Please, sit down. What can I do for you?
"
Cartman,"Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Of what?
"
Cartman,"I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
"
Officer 2,"Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in! 
"
Captain Hindsight,"Go ahead.
"
Officer 2,"The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!
"
Captain Hindsight,"Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened.
"
Officer 2,"Right.  Thank you! 
"
Fireman 2,"Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!
"
Captain Hindsight,"Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!
"
Commissioner,"Yes?
"
Captain Hindsight,"Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong!  It's not a blessing, it's a curse.
"
Cartman,"...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone.
"
Cartman,"Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
"
Captain Hindsight,"Get this kid out of here! I have to think!
"
Cartman,"Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 
"
Anchor Man,"The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:
"
Tony Hayward,"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf us a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sorry.  BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum.  We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it.
"
Coon,"Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on!  All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet.
"
Toolshed,"How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
"
Coon,"Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2?  We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it.
"
Professor Chaos,"Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love.
"
Coon,"Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!
"
Mosquito,"...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.
"
Coon,"That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!
"
Mosquito,"Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero.
"
Mysterion,"Agreed.
"
Coon,"Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!
"
Toolshed,"Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!
"
Coon,"You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!
"
Mysterion,"We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!
"
Coon,"All right, Mosquito, how do you wanna help people suffering in the Gulf crisis? 
"
Mosquito,"I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.
"
Coon,"A bake sale?
"
Mosquito,"I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people.
"
Coon,"We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!
"
Mysterion,"Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
"
Iron Maiden,"Timmeh!
"
Coon,"You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind?
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.
"
Coon,"Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!
"
Mosquito,"And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!
"
Coon,"Oh, what are you, the boss now?!
"
Mosquito,"No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan? 
"
Coon,"Sounds awesome. Let's do it.
"
Toolshed,"To the grocery store!
"
Coon,"As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. 
"
Coon,"Well, now we're back to normal.  Just like before and all forgotten? Right right?
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Right right.
"
Mosquito,"Right.
"
Coon,"Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends? 
"
Anchor Man,"Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error.  This time, the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension.  The oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there, but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic.  Now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc. 
"
Tony Hayward,"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry.  We're sorry.  We're sorry.  Sohr-ry.
"
Butler,"Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!
"
Captain Hindsight,"I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.
"
Butler,"What, sir? You know you can tell me.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?
"
Butler,"Yes sir.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Look at those photos on the desk. 
"
Butler,"My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?
"
Captain Hindsight,"'Course it's Courtney Love!
"
Butler,"But when did you have a-
"
Captain Hindsight,"I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!
"
Butler,"That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!
"
Captain Hindsight,"I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-
"
Butler,"Sir! SIR!
"
Reporter,"Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, ""Where is Captain Hindsight?""
"
Rescuer 6,"Where are you, Captain Hindsight?
"
Cajun Shrimper,"Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.
"
Reporter,"With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?
"
Coon,"My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!
"
Toolshed,"There's more important things to discuss right now!
"
Coon,"Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?
"
Mysterion,"He means we need to discuss things with you!
"
Coon,"Okay, what?
"
Mysterion,"Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!
"
TupperWear,"I don't wanna tell him either.
"
The Human Kite,"I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends.
"
Coon,"You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.
"
Toolshed,"We all voted, it was unanimous.
"
Coon,"You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!
"
The Human Kite,"Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish.
"
Mysterion,"But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
"
Coon,"You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!
"
Mysterion,"We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? 
"
Liane,"Yes, Mysterion?
"
Mysterion,"Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
"
Liane,"Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?
"
Coon,"Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!
"
Liane,"Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language!  Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!
"
Coon,"You've gotta be fucking kidding me!
"
DP Executive 1,"Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!
"
Tony Hayward,"Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another ""I'm sorry"" campaign to please everyone this time.
"
DP Executive 2,"Oh, what a right pickle we're in. 
"
DP Executive 3,"There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in.
"
Tony Hayward,"Wait a tick!  Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!
"
DP Executive 4,"How, by Jove?
"
Tony Hayward,"We drill.
"
DP Executives,"Drill of course, yes, yes, of course.
"
Tony Hayward,"I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill.
"
DP Executive 5,"I don't quite get it.
"
Tony Hayward,"We got into this mess by drilling heuh , and heuh . Now, we need to drill heuh! 
"
DP Executive 6,"That looks extremely promising!
"
Tony Hayward,"Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time.
"
DP Executive 6,"The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?
"
Tony Hayward,"Oh, she'll take it.
"
Anchor Man,"The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.
"
Stan,"Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys.
"
Reporter,"Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident.  This time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty Cthulhu.  The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement:
"
Tony Hayward,"As president of DP Oil, I want to say... We're sorry.  I'm deeply sorry.  Sorry.
"
Reporter,"Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign.
"
Stan,"It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
"
Cartman,"Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
"
Cartman,"Asshoooles! 
"
Mysterion,"I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school.  For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone.  The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized.
"
Tony Hayward,"We're sorry.
"
Mysterion,"But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension.
"
Tony Hayward,"We're sorry. 
"
Mysterion,"Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge.
"
Tony Hayward,"Sorry. 
"
Mysterion,"I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! 
"
Woman 1,"Just terrific what you boys are doing.
"
Mysterion,"Thank you, ma'am.
"
Man 1,"I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals.
"
Field Reporter,"A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little ""superhuman"" themselves. They call themselves ""Coon and Friends,"" and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis.
"
Mysterion,"We believe that every little bit helps.
"
Field Reporter,"Their little ""super club"" consists of seven young heroes. 
"
Toolshed,"Toolshed!
"
Human Kite,"The Human Kite!
"
Mysterion,"Mysterion!
"
TupperWear,"TupperWear!
"
Mosquito,"Mosquito!
"
Iron Maiden,"Timmah!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint Berry Crrrunch! 
"
Field Reporter,"The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote,  ""a dick"".
"
Toolshed,"Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?
"
Mysterion,"Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that  extremely funny.
"
Clerk,"Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour.
"
Passengers,"Awwww!
"
Coon,"Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW!  Yes yes, I am the Coon.
"
Blonde Girl,"The Coon? I've heard of that.
"
Coon,"Ya have?
"
Blonde Girl,"I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends.
"
Coon,"Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now.
"
Blonde Girl,"Can I ask you a question?
"
Coon,"Yes, of course.
"
Blonde Girl,"Do you know Mint-Berry Crunch? What's he like? 
"
Coon,"The evil girl villain fought with all her might, but the Coon was too much for her. As people looked on and cheered for the Coon, he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face!  This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans!
"
Mosquito,"That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars.
"
Toolshed,"Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!
"
Iron Maiden,"Timmah! 
"
Man 2,"I'll take ten lemon bars.
"
Mosquito,"Ten. Yes sir! 
"
Human Kite,"That's definitely the last of them.
"
Man 2,"You'll never stop him, you know. 
"
Mosquito,"Stop who?
"
Man 2,"The Great One.  Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon.  Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here.  Oh man, these are really good lemon bars. 
"
Toolshed,"The Necronomicon?
"
TupperWear,"What's a mythos?
"
Mysterion,"I don't know, but I think we'd better find out.
"
Toolshed,"All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crrunch!
"
TupperWear,"What the hell?!
"
Mosquito,"I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!
"
Mysterion,"Not Cartman.
"
Human Kite,"What do you mean ""Not Cartman,"" dude?
"
Mysterion,"Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Don't anybody move!  So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!
"
Toolshed,"Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight.
"
Narrator,"Captain Hindsight,  the hero of the modern age. Once a reporter for the National News, Jack Brolin always had a knack for hindsight.  Wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country, Jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels. But then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment. The reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels!  For months he was able to use his new powers for good, fighting for peace, and the American way.  With his three trusty companions, Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda.  But now, the Hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume Jack's very soul. It's Captaiiin Hindsight!
"
Captain Hindsight,"I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!
"
Toolshed,"Um dude, are you okay?
"
Captain Hindsight,"Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean.
"
Captain Hindsight,"You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!
"
Professor Chaos,"Uhhh ohhh...
"
Mysterion,"Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!
"
Professor Chaos,"But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-
"
Captain Hindsight,"Alright enough! What's going on?!
"
Mysterion,"Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!
"
Captain Hindsight,"It's not Courtney Love?
"
Mysterion,"Please sir, put down the gun.
"
Captain Hindsight,"No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!
"
Toolshed,"Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home.
"
Captain Hindsight,"NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!
"
Mysterion,"Then do it!  Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!
"
Human Kite,"Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out.
"
Mysterion,"You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Wuh uh okay, if you insist. Uh see ya, Kenny.
"
Human Kite,"My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-
"
Mysterion,"I said it's fine! Just go! 
"
Toolshed,"Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. 
"
Coon,"Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here!  Hey Cthulhu. 'Sup? Yes, it is me, the Coon! But don't worry, I'm actually not here to fight you! We are not so different, Cthulhu. Though I am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension, perhaps, we can work together!  I know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves. I do, bro! But there's a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop YOU!  Good, I have your attention. The superhumans I speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you! They reside in Colorado and they are fucking assholes, and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion! You can do that, right? Send people into a dark oblivion? 'Cause that's what those buttholes deserve!  No-Dude! Dude, Colorado is that way! Where are you going??  Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!
"
Captain Hindsight,"It doesn't matter.  Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore.  Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight?  As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!
"
Mysterion,"People need you, Hindsight!  Without you they feel helpless and stupid.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!
"
Mysterion,"You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker!  Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know.
"
Captain Hindsight,"Wha-? What is your power?
"
Mysterion,"I can't die.  I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes.  And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, ""Oh hey Kenny."" Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes.  You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy.
"
Announcer,"And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP.
"
Tony Hayward,"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do?  Should I admit we've made mistakes?  Should I remind you we've done this before? What should I do? Should I find newer and better ways to say I'm sorry? 
"
Captain Hindsight,"Should I really believe I ruined my legacy?  What should I do?
"
Tony Hayward,"What should I do?
"
Mysterion,"What should I do?  Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?
"
Tony Hayward,"Or should I tell you, ""I am not a role model."" 
"
Captain Hindsight,"Seriously, what should I do?
"
Tony Hayward,"Should I accept my role as the villain?
"
Mysterion,"Maybe I should just... disappear.
"
Tony Hayward,"Should I not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen? They're my technicians! 
"
Captain Hindsight,"Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?
"
Coon,"Should I just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back? Tell then that I was being a selfish jerk?  What should I do?
"
Captain Hindsight,"Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter? 
"
Coon,"Should I admit I was wrong? Ask for everyone's forgiveness and go back to my original team?  Nah, screw that. I'm just gonna keep bein' a fuckin' dick! 
"
Toolshed,"All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!
"
Mosquito,"Right, Toolshed!
"
Human Kite,"Here we go: ""The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them.""
"
Toolshed,"""It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu.""
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion?
"
Mysterion,"I'm fine.
"
Human Kite,"Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago.
"
Mysterion,"So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
"
Human Kite,"Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents.
"
Mysterion,"Uhh, what?  What the fuck?! I m-I mean,  Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! 
"
Betsy,"Clyde? Clyde, I told you this morning to take the garbage out.  Clyde, do you hear me?
"
Mosquito,"Okay Mom, just give me two minutes.  Nag nag nag. 
"
Coon,"Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious.  But sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute.  Time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe.  Who's the sleepy little man?  My name is the Little Coon. What is your name?  Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!  You're a sleepy man ne, Cthulhu?  Who's a needs a tummy rub? 
"
Mrs. McCormick,"You're hoggin' it all, asshole! 
"
Stuart,"'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!
"
Mrs. McCormick,"You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!
"
Stuart,"I told you to shut up!
"
Mrs. McCormick,"Give to me, you prick!  AH! AAAAH!  Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!
"
Stuart,"Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much.
"
Mrs. McCormick,"And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. 
"
Mysterion,"I'm not here about that.
"
Stuart,"Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what?
"
Mysterion,"Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
"
Mrs. McCormick,"We were?
"
Stuart,"We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio.
"
Mysterion,"Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?! 
"
Stuart,"Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go.
"
Mysterion,"What happened at those meetings?
"
Stuart,"Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time.
"
Mysterion,"I don't find that hard to believe at all.
"
Mrs. McCormick,"I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited.
"
Mysterion,"These people still meet? Where?
"
Stuart,"Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.
"
Mrs. McCormick,"They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do.  Did that really just happen?
"
Stuart,"I don't think so. 
"
Field Reporter,"Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news.
"
Coon,"Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?!
"
Followers,"ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
"
Cult Leader,"The Old One has awakened!  A lot of us have waited a long time for this day. Well for all our South Park Cthulhu members old and new, it is time to par-tay! 
"
Mysterion,"There must be clubs like this all over the world.
"
Toolshed,"We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys.
"
Human Kite,"Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?
"
Red Goth,"I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.
"
Tall Goth,"Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel.
"
Toolshed,"Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?
"
Mysterion,"Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.
"
Cult Leader,"Now let us read from the Necronomicon. ""That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons""
"
Followers,"""Even Death may die."" 
"
Toolshed,"""In strange aeons even Death may die?"" What does that mean, Human Kite?
"
Human Kite,"I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion? 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.
"
Jack Brolin,"A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers.
"
Injured Man,"Where are you Captain Hindsight? Aggh!
"
Jack Brolin,"Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...
"
Red Goth,"Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school?
"
Tall Goth,"No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness.
"
Red Goth,"Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself.  Who the F'n H is that?
"
Mysterion,"What does it mean? ""That is not dead which can eternal lie""?
"
Tall Goth,"""And with strange aeons even Death may die.""
"
Mysterion,"What does it mean?!
"
Red Goth,"It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever.
"
Tall Goth,"Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser.
"
Mysterion,"You're going to tell me everything you know!
"
Kindergoth,"Nobody's stopping Cthulhu now! All will be sadness. Life will become death, and I will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck.
"
Tall Goth,"Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth.
"
Red Goth,"Hardcore goth.
"
Cult Leader,"The child is right, you know. Cthulhu sees all, hears all. The dark lord wants us to dispense of this one, kids. Give us a hand.
"
Red Goth,"Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody.
"
Tall Goth,"We're dark lord minions now, wuss. What'd you think we'd be doing?
"
Red Goth,"Ugh, whatevs. 
"
Singer,"Cthulhu Cthulhu, Cthulhu Cthulhu.
"
Coon,"Yeeheah!
"
Singer,"The evil hate-filled Cthulhu, from a dimension far away.Flying through gates of madness and into your heart
"
Coon,"Yeah, fuck all o'you!
"
Singer,"Turning dreams into nightmares
"
Coon,"Lick my balls!
"
Singer,"Destroying all he sees
"
Coon,"Now begins a new adventure for... MEEEE!
"
Singer,"You and the dark one, Cthulhu
Sharing adventures and smiles,
It's a magical bond two pals can share.
Soon the whole world will be made aware of
You and the death lord, Cthulhu
Makin' the world a better place.
Together you will have so much fun
"
Coon,"Sending all my stupid friends to oblivion!
"
Singer,"You and the dark one, Cthulhu
"
Coon,"Suck it, bitches!
"
Cult Leader,"Just hold still and it will all be over quickly. 
"
Mosquito,"Let him go!  Coon and Friends, ho! Mosquito!
"
Toolshed,"Toolshed!
"
TupperWear,"TupperWear!
"
Iron Maiden,"Timmeh!
"
Human Kite,"Human Kite!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crrrunch!
"
Toolshed,"Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!
"
Cult Leader,"Sorry kids. It's a little late for that. 
"
Toolshed,"Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!
"
Human Kite,"You bastards! 
"
Toolshed,"Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!
"
Mosquito,"Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass!
"
Human Kite,"Let's go. 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crunch! 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch!  Our story begins in a remote corner of the Gulf of Mexico.  The BP Oil Company drills into the ocean floor,  but they drill too much, and the BP Oil Company accidentally unleashes Cthulhu, an ancient evil god from another dimension. Halfway across the country,  a mild-mannered attractive fourth-grader, Bradley Biggle, hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends.  But Bradley Biggle is no ordinary fourth-grader! Not long ago, he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word, ""Shablagoo!"" And in a flash, Bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch! Joined by the other Coon Friends, Mint-Berry Crunch went to investigate the Gulf spill crisis! The superheroes came across a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival. They are the key to stopping Cthulhu from taking over the world! Sometimes, when everything seems hopeless, that's when you need to bring it all.  That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch!
"
Toolshed,"Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Rrright!
"
Human Kite,"But then what exactly is your superpower?
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!
"
Toolshed,"...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-
"
Human Kite,"And shoot lasers out of my eyes.
"
Toolshed,"And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can...  Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?
"
Mysterion,"I can't die!
"
Toolshed,"...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-
"
Mysterion,"No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!
"
Toolshed,"...Woo-hat?
"
Mysterion,"Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed ""Oh my God,"" and you called him a bastard!
"
Human Kite,"When was that?
"
Mysterion,"All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
"
Toolshed,"...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude.
"
Mysterion,"Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
"
Toolshed,"Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants. 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Nono. Mint-Berry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!
"
Mysterion,"I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.
"
Human Kite,"Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die.
"
Mysterion,"Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!
"
Toolshed,"Kenny Kenny, calm down.
"
Mysterion,"It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me!  Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! 
"
Toolshed,"Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!
"
Human Kite,"Dude!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Is he? Oh Jesus! 
"
Toolshed,"Kenny? No! No!
"
Coon,"Gather around, believers in good, and listen to the newest installment of The Coon. It all began when the BP Oil Company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension. Seeing the disaster on Coon-Vision, the Coon immediately called together his trusty Coon Friends. As the Coon explained how the disaster could be stopped, something terrible happened. Without warning, the Coon friends changed. Their superpowers morphed somehow, turning them into... supervillains.  The Coon tried to reason with them, tried to bring them back to the side of good,  but it was too late.  Their black hearts had been tainted by hate and rage. The Coon was alone, turn by the ultimate dilemma.  He had to put a stop to the evil villains, even though they had once been his friends. Sometimes, to fight the ultimate evil, you must make friends with enemies.  The Coon teamed up with Cthulhu, because even Cthulhu knows what evil assholes Kyle and Stan and those guys are! And that they are manipulative, uncaring, vagina faces! They're all planning to destroy the world. Only one thing can stop them: the Coon. With Cthulhu's help, I can try to banish them to a dark oblivion, for all eternity.  I will not rest until that happens.
"
Coon,"Bab-ay,
I know you're askin' me to stay
Say ""Please please please don't go away.""
You say I'm givin' you the blues.
Mayb-ay,
you mean every word you say
Can't help but think-
"
Liane,"Eric Cartman!
"
Coon,"Hi Mom.
"
Liane,"Where have you been, young man?!
"
Coon,"Just doin' stuff Mom. Are my friends downstairs in the secret base?
"
Liane,"Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!
"
Coon,"The Coon's mother appears to be extremely upset. In order to get past her, I must use the LeBron James technique.
"
Liane,"Eric, are you listening to me?!
"
Coon,"Mom... what should I do?
"
Liane,"What?
"
Coon,"What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do?
"
Liane,"What do you mean ""what should-""
"
Coon,"Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!
"
Liane,"I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. 
"
Human Kite,"Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next?
"
Mosquito,"Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need.
"
TupperWear,"Okay!
"
Mysterion,"You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?
"
Toolshed,"Uh-what?
"
Mysterion,"What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
"
Human Kite,"Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from.
"
Mosquito,"I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt.
"
TupperWear,"I was in a car accident, then put back together with Tupperware parts.
"
Iron Maiden,"Tih-Timmieh!
"
Mysterion,"Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
"
Coon,"Hey guys.  So, what's goin' on?
"
Toolshed,"Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?
"
Coon,"No, I, I know. That's cool, I understand. Even though I started it and the secret base is in my house. Yes, that's totally understandable.
"
Human Kite,"You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason!
"
Coon,"No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?
"
Human Kite,"You should fuck off, that's what you should do.
"
Coon,"Hm. Ah, all right, look. You guys were totally right, okay? That's all I wanted to say. That and... there's a double rainbow outside.
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"A what?
"
Coon,"Double rainbow, you guys. You don't see 'em often, but there's one outside right now. You've gotta come see! 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"A double rainbow? Shablagoo! 
"
Human Kite,"Wait, Mint-Berry Crunch ya you might not wanna go- 
"
Professor Chaos,"Huhey, can I see the double rainbow, fellas?  Uh, fellas?
"
Coon,"Isn't it beautiful you guys?
"
Human Kite,"There's no double rainbow, fatass!
"
Coon,"You are correct, Human Kike! Not that supervillains like you guys could ever see a double rainbow!
"
Mosquito,"What are you talking about?
"
Coon,"Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice!
"
Human Kite,"Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us!
"
Coon,"Nuh uh, you guys are the bad guy. 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Waaaaaaaaaah! 
"
Mysterion,"What are you doing with that thing?!
"
Coon,"He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place!
"
Human Kite,"Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy!
"
Coon,"No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!
"
Human Kite,"Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!
"
Coon,"Well, that's why Superman isn't around anymore, isn't it? Cthulhu! Banish them to a dark oblivion, please!  Aww! Dude, that was awesome! You're all like ""Mehhhh"" and they were all like ""Nooo!""
"
Coon,"All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man.  Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world, and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out. Pretty soon, the whole wold will be transformed thanks to the Coon!  Yes yes, the Coon and Friend. Now after Burning Man we'll take down Whole Foods alright?  The dark lord is agitated and the LeBron James technique might not work. The Coon will have to use an even more manipulative technique. Time to bust out: Cute Kitten.  Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow.  Meow meow meow. 
"
Toolshed,"Dude, where the fuck are we?
"
Mysterion,"I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mint-Berry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him!
"
Toolshed,"Oh shit!
"
Human Kite,"We aren't going that way!
"
Mosquito,"You guys, I wanna go home.
"
Toolshed,"We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here.
"
Mosquito,"Look, maybe we should just a place to hid and wait for help.
"
Human Kite,"What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here.
"
Mysterion,"Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. 
"
Toolshed,"How, dude?
"
Human Kite,"Kenny, where the hell are you going?
"
Mysterion,"I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. 
"
Mosquito,"Kenny! 
"
Mysterion,"Ow! That fucking HURTS! 
"
Toolshed,"Oh my God! Kenny!
"
Human Kite,"You... you crazy bastard! 
"
Man 1,"It's burning Man!
"
Man 2,"Biggest party in the world, baby! 
"
Coon,"Fucking hippies! Fuck all o'you! 
"
Reporter,"The dark and evil Cthulhu is bringing his angry wrath down upon the Burning Man Festival, Tom. Cthulhu isn't behaving as most scientists had speculated, Tom, but the dark lord is wreaking havoc everywhere and-
"
Coon,"No nonono! Excuse me! It is not Cthulhu, it is Coon and Friend! I'm a little sick of everyone giving him all the credit when I'm the one really making the world a better place!
"
Reporter,"Tom, it appears that Bruce Vilanch has arrived on the scene wearing a rat costume.
"
Coon,"Oh, you motherfucker!  Cthulhu, this guy too!  Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch.
"
Tall Goth,"This freaking sucks! We worshiped and prayed to Cthulhu, went to all the cult meetings, but life is still totally freaking gay.
"
Red Goth,"I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled.
"
A Voice,"How to I fight him? 
"
Tall Goth,"Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again.
"
Mysterion,"That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
"
Red Goth,"Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before  It's like Obama all over again.
"
Mysterion,"How do I fight him?!
"
Red Goth,"Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright?
"
Mysterion,"Tell me what that means! 
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you.
"
Henrietta,"Go away Mom, I hate you.
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley. 
"
Bradley,"Will you guys play with me?
"
Henrietta,"Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!
"
Bradley,"Please, can I just- oh g'uh!  Mu-Mysterion! Wuh what's goin'- Uh, that's okay, sis. I'll play with you another time. 
"
Bradley,"Mysterion is here! He must have come for my help.  No time to waste. Time for Bradley Biggle to transform.  Shablagoo! 
"
Henrietta,"Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. 
"
Mysterion,"One Ones?
"
Tall Goth,"Dark deities that existed before man.
"
Henrietta,"It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension.
"
Mysterion,"That's it! That's the place I just was!
"
Tall Goth,"You've been to the nightmare city of R'Lyeh?
"
Red Goth,"Luckyyy...
"
Henrietta,"Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world.
"
Mysterion,"And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
"
Henrietta,"The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mint-Berry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists!
"
Henrietta,"Get out of my room, TWERP!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion!  M- Mysterion?  Aw crap. 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Hey Mysterion, wait up!  Come on, wait uuup!  Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going?
"
Mysterion,"Wherever Cthulhu is!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"What? But he'll kill you.
"
Mysterion,"Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers.
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.
"
Mysterion,"You don't understand!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"How was it that mint and berry came together delivering full flavor in an intense crunch?  We must find out answers Mysterion.  Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you.
"
Coon,"After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped.
"
Justin Bieber,"Babih babih babih oooo! Babih babih babih oooo! Babig baibig woo woo, Bay-wooo  Wooooo-ooo-oo! 
"
Coon,"Yep, that's him. So long, Justin Bieber, you little douchebag! 
"
Reporter 2,"The dark god Cthulhu continues his rampage of destruction and terror, and there seems to be no hope for man. I'm joined now by a supposed team member of Cthulhu, the Coon.
"
Coon,"It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice.
"
Reporter 2,"Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred.
"
Coon,"Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95.
"
Mysterion,"Hey, fat boy!
"
Coon,"Kenny? What the hell? I sent you to the-
"
Mysterion,"To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars!  You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!
"
Coon,"It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!
"
Mysterion,"You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!
"
Coon,"I'm going around making the world a better place!
"
Mysterion,"For you! You're making it a better place for you!
"
Coon,"Right, that's what superheroes do.
"
Mysterion,"No! This is what superheroes do!  You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?!  Bring back my friends! Take me!
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Mysterion, no! What are you doing?!
"
Mysterion,"Only an immortal can kill another immortal!  Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!
"
Coon,"Don't listen to him Cthulhu! We have more important stuff to do!
"
Mysterion,"Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!
"
Coon,"Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me! 
"
Mysterion,"No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
"
Coon,"Fuck you, Kenny!
"
Mysterion,"Come back, you fat piece of shit! 
"
Alien Man,"Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch.
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"...Uh yes. Yes, please go on.
"
Alien Man,"Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one.
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Wow!
"
Alien Man,"Your mother and I sent you as far away as we could. Use your power, son. Save Earth. Shablagoo! 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"I will, father. No more running away for... Mint-Berry Crunch!  Hello, Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been ""berry"" nice!  Not enough, huh? Maybe the intense flavor of mint will freshen things up! 
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister. 
"
Toolshed,"Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch.
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis.
"
Human Kite,"And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs. 
"
Coon,"Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!
"
Human Kite,"You're not going anywhere for a long time!
"
Coon,"This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat!
"
Toolshed,"Ya got poop, don't ya?
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents.
"
Human Kite,"Well, come back and visit any time, dude.
"
Mint-Berry Crunch,"I will. Shaaablagoo! 
"
Coon,"Fuckin' Mint-Berry fuckin' Crunch.
"
Toolshed,"Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?
"
Mysterion,"Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. 
"
Toolshed,"Oh my God! Holy shit dude!
"
Human Kite,"Kenny? No! Nooo!
"
Stuart,"What? Whaaat?!
"
Mrs. McCormick,"It's happenin' again! 
"
Mrs. McCormick,"We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. 
"
Reporter,"Passenger said the Carnival cruise line smelled like poop, but that that was an improvement.
"
Sharon,"All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night.  You coming?
"
Randy,"Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
"
Sharon,"Randy, do not watch that no-no channel.
"
Randy,"Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
"
Sharon,"Alright, come to bed soon.
"
Randy,"Psseh... huh...  Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot...  Oh yeah. Fuck.
"
Guy Fieri,"Mmm, just look at that rack of ribs; now those are slow-cooked, and then braised to bring out the smokey flavor.
"
Randy,"Mmm, God damn. Yeah.
"
Guy Fieri,"See how that just falls off the bone?  Mmm, that is MONEY right there!
"
Randy,"Yeah, it's fuckin' money.
"
Announcer,"Next on Food Network it's Paula Deen 
"
Paula Deen,"Hey y'all. Tonight we're gonna be makin' some deep-fried chicken.
"
Randy,"Aw yeah?
"
Paula Deen,"Muh buttery whipped potatoes and we're gonna be finishin' off with a chocolate pecan pie.
"
Randy,"Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah. 
"
Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?
"
Randy,"Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!
"
Stan,"Aw crap. 
"
Randy,"Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...
"
Sharon,"Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!
"
Randy,"No!
"
Sharon,"Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made.
"
Randy,"Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
"
Stan,"Can I have a Pop Tart?
"
Kyle,"Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
"
Terrance,"Hello, and welcome to Progressive. 
"
Phillip,"Yes, we're looking to buy car insurance.
"
Terrance,"Well, you've come to the right place. 
"
Phillip,"Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico!  Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there.
"
Randy,"Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. 
"
Alton Brown,"Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action.
"
Randy,"Aw yeah, look at that.
"
Stan,"Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
"
Randy,"I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
"
Alton Brown,"We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over.
"
Randy,"Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.
"
Alton Brown,"Now let's get that on the grill.
"
Randy,"See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
"
Alton Brown,"Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for.
"
Randy,"Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!
"
Announcer,"We'll be right back to Good Eats.
"
Woman 1,"Hey ladies, are you looking for a better workout?
"
Randy,"Aww, stupid commercials.
"
Woman 1,"Introducing the Shake Weight. A spring-loaded workout device you pump with your arms. Just grab the piston and go to work. One-handed or double-fisted.
"
Randy,"Come on!
"
Woman 1,"You just shake it. Back and forth.
"
Woman 2,"It feels really good in my hands.
"
Woman 1,"Best of all, Shake Weight tells you when your workout is finished by chiming and releasing a cool-down spray. 
"
Randy,"Bohh-riiing.
"
Woman 1,"Order now and we'll include the optional heart rate monitor. Just put your finger in the tester.  and Shake Weight takes your pulse.  Get yours today.
"
Announcer,"Now back to Good Eats.
"
Alton Brown,"Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing.
"
Randy,"Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.
"
Alton Brown,"Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is- 
"
Randy,"Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?
"
Sharon,"Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
"
Randy,"I wasn't watching food channels!
"
Sharon,"Then how do you know I blocked them?
"
Randy,"I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 
"
Hotline Man,"Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say ""crème fraîche.""
"
Randy,"Crème fraîche.
"
Amanda,"Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?
"
Randy,"Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
"
Amanda,"I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
"
Randy,"Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
"
Amanda,"Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes.
"
Randy,"Yeah?
"
Amanda,"Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.
"
Randy,"You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
"
Amanda,"Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
"
Randy,"If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
"
Amanda,"I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard. 
"
Randy,"Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
"
Amanda,"I was thinking about shallots, actually.
"
Randy,"Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
"
Sharon,"Randy! Marsh!
"
Randy,"WAH! Sharon!
"
Hotline Man,"Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say ""crème fraîche.""
"
Sharon,"I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop.
"
Sheila,"Sharon, I'm so sorry.
"
Sharon,"It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all.
"
Sheila,"Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon.
"
Sharon,"Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
"
Sheila,"There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
"
Associate,"Help you find anything? 
"
Sharon,"Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?
"
Michael,"Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?
"
Sharon,"Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
"
Michael,"Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out. 
"
Sharon,"I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
"
Michael,"Small white ones, yes ma'am.  Standard or voice assist model?
"
Sharon,"Well I don't know-
"
Michael,"I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.
"
Shake Weight,"You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms.  Wow. Good job.  You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting.
"
Sharon,"Thank you, Shake Weight.
"
Shake Weight,"Come on now. Almost finished.  Yes. Good. Almost done.  Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Faster. 
"
Sharon,"Hahhh.
"
Shake Weight,"Your workout is finished.  Here is some cab fare.
"
Sharon,"Oh wow.
"
Shake Weight,"Now going to sleep mode. 
"
Stan,"You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
"
Cartman,"Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. 
"
Randy,"Hello there, children!
"
Stan,"Awww what?!
"
Randy,"How's it goin'? 
"
Stan,"No, dad! No!
"
Randy,"The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
"
Stan,"Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
"
Randy,"I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
"
Cartman,"Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
"
Randy,"Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli.
"
Stan,"Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!
"
Randy,"Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
"
Stan,"Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
"
Sharon,"Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
"
Stan,"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
"
Sharon,"You think your father's gonna listen to me?! 
"
Shake Weight,"This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.
"
Sharon,"Oh.  This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
"
Shake Weight,"That's it. Work it. Harder, faster.
"
Stan,"Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
"
Sharon,"Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! 
"
Shake Weight,"You are independent and strong.
"
Sharon,"Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
"
Shake Weight,"Switch arms.
"
Sharon,"I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
"
Shake Weight,"You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger.  Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five.  Faster. Harder.
"
Randy,"Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh  mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche.
"
Randy Singing,"La lalala la la...
"
Randy,"Aww, fuck yeah. 
"
Randy Singing,"Lalalalala la, fraîche, fraîche.
"
Randy,"Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... 
"
Randy Singing,"Crème fraîche, Cafeteria Fraîche. Lalalalala fraîche. Ho ho hohoho.
"
Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?
"
Randy Singing,"Fraîche. 
"
Randy,"Fraîche.
"
Randy Singing,"Cafeteria Fraîche.
"
Randy,"Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
"
Craig,"Can we have some food, please? 
"
Randy,"Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
"
Stan,"Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
"
Randy,"Quiet on set, please.
"
Stan,"No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!
"
Randy,"Back from where?
"
Sharon,"Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this.
"
Shake Weight,"You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.
"
Sharon,"Oh, thanks Shake Weight.
"
Shake Weight,"You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.
"
Sharon,"You're right.
"
Shake Weight,"Tell me again about the women who you do not like.
"
Sharon,"Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all.
"
Shake Weight,"Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful.  How about a quick workout?
"
Sharon,"A workout? Right now?
"
Shake Weight,"Just a quickie. You can do it.
"
Sharon,"I don't really like working out in public.
"
Shake Weight,"Come on. You can do it.  That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster.  You are amazing. Switch arms.  Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster.  I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes.  Your workout is finished. Your cab fare.  Now going to sleep mode. 
"
Kyle,"We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
"
Stan,"He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
"
Kyle,"He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
"
Cartman,"Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
"
Stan,"That's stupid, Cartman.
"
Kyle,"He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, it's really good.)
"
Kyle,"Let's hear it, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
"
Stan,"You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded.
"
Randy,"Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
"
Stan,"...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
"
Randy,"Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
"
Shake Weight,"You have not worked out in seven hours.
"
Sharon,"Oh God, not right now.
"
Shake Weight,"Come on. Let's get to it.
"
Sharon,"Ugh, I'm tired.
"
Shake Weight,"You have not worked out in seven hours.
"
Sharon,"Oh, where is that sleep mode button?
"
Shake Weight,"Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?
"
Sharon,"Ugghh.
"
Shake Weight,"Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.
"
Sharon,"All right. Fine. 
"
Shake Weight,"That's it. Good.  A little faster. Harder.  Come on. Get into it. That's it. Now switch arms.  You are so attractive and you have interesting things to say.  Come on. You are almost there. Faster. Do it faster.  Now going to sleep mode. 
"
Sharon,"Ahhh.
"
Cartman,"What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
"
Randy,"Yes chef!
"
Cartman,"Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
"
Stan,"Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
"
Randy,"No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!
"
Stan,"Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 
"
Bobby Flay,"Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?
"
Randy,"Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
"
Bobby Flay,"I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!
"
Randy,"Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!
"
Announcer,"A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme?
"
Stan,"Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
"
Jamie Oliver,"Hold on. Wait. School cafeteria food needs to be healthy.  Why, why won't people listen to me?
"
Randy,"Jamie Oliver!
"
Announcer,"And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen , and Giata De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head.
"
Kyle,"Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
"
Sharon,"""Your room is being serviced""? Ugh, oh well.  Uhh, excuse me?
"
Rosemary,"Oh,  uh no, no,  sorry. I done with cleaning,  thank you. Please, sorry. 
"
Shake Weight,"...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What? 
"
Sharon,"Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!
"
Shake Weight,"This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.
"
Sharon,"Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
"
Shake Weight,"You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.
"
Sharon,"I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!
"
Shake Weight,"You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest. 
"
Announcer,"Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!
"
Randy,"Behind you!
"
Announcer,"Whose cafeteria food will win? These chefs are cooking their hearts out and bringing their A-game to serve the kids of this elementary school.  These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again.
"
Jamie Oliver,"Kids' food should be healthy. Why ain't it healthy?
"
Announcer,"And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.
"
Randy,"Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!
"
Announcer,"The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
"
Randy,"Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
"
Sharon,"Randy, I'm back.
"
Randy,"Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??
"
Sharon,"Randy, we should talk.
"
Randy,"I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
"
Sharon,"Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?
"
Randy,"You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
"
Sharon,"What'd you say?
"
Randy,"I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
"
Sharon,"Can I try something?
"
Randy,"Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.
"
Sharon,"You gonna go back to the kitchen?
"
Randy,"Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
"
Sharon,"No, I'm good, thanks. 
"
Randy,"I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 
"
Shake Weight,"I guess my work here is finished.
"
Sharon,"Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?
"
Shake Weight,"Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress.
"
Sharon,"I'll remember that now, thanks to you.
"
Shake Weight,"It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer.
"
Sharon,"Goodbye, Shake Weight.

Character,Line
Cartman,"Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 
"
Craig,"Tom Saltzman says you don't really have an iPad.
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Craig,"Tom Saltzman says you just glued a piece of glass to an iPad cover and you're faking it. 
"
Cartman,"Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 
"
Stan,"Let me see your iPad, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
"
Kyle,"Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
"
Kyle,"So, plug it in.
"
Cartman,"I left my charger at home!  Fine! I'm gonna go home and charge my iPad and bring it tomorrow, and you guys are gonna feel really stupid! 
"
Cartman,"Well good going, Mom! You completely screwed me over!
"
Liane,"What happened, Eric?
"
Cartman,"YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
"
Kyle,"You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
"
Man,"Oh. Yeah, Apple's stuff is pretty neat alright. I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times. 
"
Kyle,"Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 
"
Apple Man 1,"There he is!  Hello Kyle, we're from Apple. We're all ready for you now. 
"
Kyle,"What? Ready for what?
"
Apple Man 1,"To fulfill the agreement. Can we get a weight please? 
"
Apple Man 2,"83 pounds, sir.
"
Kyle,"What ""agreement""?!
"
Apple Man 1,"83 pounds, good. Let's get the bloodwork.
"
Kyle,"Hey! You can't do that! 
"
Apple Man 1,"You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.
"
Kyle,"What are you talking about?!
"
Apple Man 1,"When you downloaded the last iTunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions. You clicked ""Agree."" Alright, let's get him to the water tank.
"
Kyle,"The water tank?   Hey I'm not going with you!
"
Apple Man 1,"You've agreed to all of this!  Hey!
"
Kyle,"You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Kyle,"It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
"
Stan,"Why? What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
"
Kyle,"I don't know, I didn't read them!
"
Butters,"You didn't read them?
"
Kyle,"Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
"
Stan,"I do.
"
Clyde,"Me too.
"
Kyle,"You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the entire terms and conditions?
"
Jimmy,"Of course.
"
Butters,"Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
"
Kyle,"Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
"
Apple Man 1,"There he is. Hey you!
"
Kyle,"Gahhh! 
"
Kyle,"Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!
"
Gerald,"Kyle? What are you doing here?
"
Kyle,"Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
"
Gerald,"Well, Kyle, it's always the agreeing party's responsibility to know what they are signing.
"
Kyle,"But it's like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks! How can they know if I-
"
Gerald,"Calm down, Kyle! It's okay. You're safe with Daddy. 
"
Apple Man 1,"Here he is!
"
Kyle,"AAHH!
"
Apple Man 1,"Come on you!
"
Gerald,"Hey, what the heck is going on?
"
Apple Man 1,"Your son has made a binding and legal agreement with Apple, sir.
"
Gerald,"An agreement to do what?!
"
Apple Man 1,"Apple's inner workings are top secret to all users. You know how it is.
"
Gerald,"No, I don't know how it is. I use a PC.
"
Apple Man 1,"You what?
"
Apple Man 4,"Come on, let's go!
"
Gerald,"Hey now, let him go! 
"
Kyle,"Dad! You tasered my dad!
"
Apple Man 1,"You said we could.
"
Cartman,"Okay, WiFi+3G, 64 gigs. This one, this one!
"
Liane,"Oh, sweetie, $900?
"
Cartman,"I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
"
Liane,"Eric, we can't afford that one.
"
Cartman,"Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
"
Liane,"I think we need to get you a different brand, hon. They're a little cheaper.
"
Cartman,"Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
"
Liane,"Here, look at this one. A Toshiba Handibook.
"
Cartman,"Toshiba Handibook??
"
Liane,"This says it does everything the iPad does, at half the price.
"
Cartman,"Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
"
Liane,"Eric, stop acting like a spoiled brat! You can either have the Toshiba Handibook or you can have nothing at all!
"
Cartman,"Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
"
Liane,"Eric!
"
Cartman,"You might as well go buy some cigarettes too, because I like to have a smoke after I get good and fucked! Do you wanna fuck me Mom?!  Just say so! Go ahead! Here!  Huh?! Go ahead, Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me right here in the Best Buy! You wanna fuck your son so bad?! Go on Mom! Fuck me! Fuck me!
"
Liane,"Stop crying, Eric! I told you if you kept acting up, you weren't getting anything!
"
Cartman,"But I told you I was sorry.
"
Liane,"You made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people!
"
Cartman,"I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.
"
Liane,"Then why did you go outside to a police officer and say ""Help! Help! My mommy is trying to fuck me!""?
"
Cartman,"Oh wait, I get it now! The F-word is a no-no word, and I shouldn't say it around other people. I'm sorry Momma.
"
Liane,"If you're really sorry, then you'll understand why you aren't getting anything!
"
Cartman,"Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
"
Liane,"No!
"
Cartman,"Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 
"
Woman,"What are you going to do to us??
"
Kyle,"What is this? What's going on?
"
Woman,"You... You agreed to the iTunes terms and conditions too??
"
Kyle,"...What?
"
Woman,"I just clicked ""Agree."" I didn't read it! I was in a hurry, you see, and I, I, I didn't know what I was agreeing to!
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) I can't even read Engrish!
"
Guard,"Hey, shut up in there! You all agreed to stay quiet!
"
Kyle,"Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
"
Guard,"You can't agree by accident. There's a fail-safe built in. Even if you click on ""Agree"" another little window pops up that says ""Are you sure you agree?"" and you have to click on ""Agree"" again.
"
Woman,"Uh, what are you going to do to us??
"
Guard,"Everything that you agreed to in the iTunes conditions.
"
Kyle,"We didn't read them!
"
Guard,"Heh! Riiight. Who just agrees to something they don't read? 
"
Announcer,"And now, the president of Apple, Steve Jobs! 
"
Steve Jobs,"Hello everyone, I'm here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices. Let's hear it for our volunteers!  These three people have agreed to be brought here, handcuffed to these beds, and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device.
"
Kyle,"The first what?
"
Steve Jobs,"They have actually agreed to be surgically altered.  Their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus.
"
Woman,"What??
"
Steve Jobs,"You agreed to this!  Mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy -  and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy, leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed; they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device, making a product that is part human, and part centipede, and part Web browser, and part emailing device! I give you... the HUMANCENTiPad!
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Oho... I should habu never appudeitedo iTunes!
"
Butters,"""You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store.""
"
Gerald,"Can somebody please explain to me what is going on?!
"
Stan,"We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
"
Gerald,"There can't be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what they're talking about to Kyle!
"
Butters,"Hold up. Here it is right here: ""by clicking Agree, you are also acknowledging that Apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another iTunes user""
"
Stan,"Oh boy.
"
Butters,"""Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract."" Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... ""Decline.""
"
Gerald,"Well that does it! I'm going to the police!
"
Stan,"For what?
"
Gerald,"To find out where Apple is keeping my son!
"
Stan,"Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
"
Butters,"The Geniuses...
"
Kenny,"(The Geniuses...)
"
Steve Jobs,"Alright. Good. Looks good, guys. Great work. 
"
Junichi,"Nanda... Nanda kore?! 
"
Steve Jobs,"Really nice, guys.  I remember when the first version of the iPad came out. People couldn't believe how easy it was to take their videos, music, and photos, and all their shit,  and share it, with other people, who could do the same with all their shit. The only thing the iPad couldn't do was walk or read. Until now.
"
Kyle,"(I need some help! I can't take it!)
"
Steve Jobs,"What, what what's that? What's that you're saying?
"
Kyle,"(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
"
Steve Jobs,"Yeah you want out? Are you saying you want out?
"
Kyle,"(Yes! Please! Let me go!)
"
Steve Jobs,"Fine. You don't want to be part of this? Then just sign right here.  Nooo! You didn't read it! This says we don't ever have to let you out and that we can do whatever we want!  Dammit, why won't it read?!
"
Apple Tech,"It's probably low on power. We should feed it.
"
Steve Jobs,"Alright. Here you go, come on.
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Nooo!  I will not eat if they are forced to iito my poo!
"
Steve Jobs,"Perhaps I didn't mention...  it's a bean and cheese burrito from Paco's.
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Sori, Kairu. I tried to resist but burrito isu too dericious! 
"
Steve Jobs,"We have to unveil this thing tomorrow. It better be reading by then!
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Oh, oh no... feel sick...
"
Kyle,"(You're fine!)
"
Junichi,"Oooho, oooh! 
"
Kyle,"(Yaaaaah!) 
"
Woman,"(Aaaaaah!)
"
Announcer,"Today, on Dr. Phil. The tragic story of a little boy whose mother constantly tries to fuck him.
"
Dr. Phil,"I want you all to meet Eric Cartman, who's a very special boy with a very hard life. Eric, you say that your mom fucks you?
"
Cartman,"Yes! She fucks me so hard!
"
Dr. Phil,"Does this happen often? Does she- does she fuck you a lot?
"
Cartman,"Dude, Filipino hookers don't get fucked the way I do!
"
Audience,"Ohhh...
"
Dr. Phil,"Now, I know this is very difficult for you to talk about, but... where was the last time your mother fucked you?
"
Cartman,"At Best Buy.
"
Audience,"Ahhh...
"
Dr. Phil,"Your mother fucked you at Best Buy?
"
Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
Dr. Phil,"And people saw her doing this?
"
Cartman,"Yes!
"
Dr. Phil,"And they didn't do anything?
"
Cartman,"No!
"
Liane,"Eric, stop it!
"
Cartman,"Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
"
Audience,"Booooooo!
"
Cartman,"Booooooo!
"
Liane,"Eric, you come home, right now!
"
Audience,"Booooooo!
"
Dr. Phil,"Ma'am, why do you think it's okay to fuck your son?
"
Liane,"I DON'T!
"
Cartman,"She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
"
Audience,"Awwwwww!
"
Cartman,"You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
"
Man 1,"You fuck your son and you won't even give him a kiss? Booooooo!
"
Man 2,"If I was gonna fuck my son, I'd kiss him first! 
"
Dr. Phil,"Well Eric, we have a very special gift we wanna give you.
"
Cartman,"An iPad??? 
"
Announcer,"Gerald Broflovski.
"
Stan,"Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 
"
Leslie,"Hi, my name is Leslie. I'll be your Genius.
"
Stan,"Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
"
Leslie,"What problems are you experiencing?
"
Gerald,"My son was kidnapped by Apple and they are holding him against his will!!
"
Leslie,"Oh-kay, well I'm sorry you're having trouble with that today. Could I have his Apple ID?
"
Stan,"69ingchipmunks@me.com 
"
Leslie,"Okay. 
"
Gerald,"Well what the heck does this w-! 
"
Leslie,"Oh okay. I see. Hmm. Hmm, I might need to bring another Genius in on this.  Frothgar?
"
Frothgar,"Uh huh?
"
Leslie,"This guy's son was abducted by us?  Should I run a stop-check or just give him store credit?
"
Gerald,"No I don't want store credit, I want my son back!
"
Frothgar,"'Kay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform.
"
Stan,"Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
"
Frothgar,"He didn't read it?
"
Butters,"We know. It's preposterous.
"
Frothgar,"Hrrrrgh. 
"
Leslie,"Sooo, just give them store credit?
"
Junichi,"Aarrrgh. Dame kore!  (In Japanese Accent) So sori Kairu, but I am starving! Which would you rather I eat? Should I iito cuttlefish and asparagus, or the vanilla peisuto?
"
Kyle,"(Vanilla paste! Vanilla paste!)
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Cuttlefish and asparagus?
"
Kyle,"(No! That's not what I said! Vanilla paste!)
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Very well I will iito the cuttlefish. 
"
Kyle,"(NOOOO!) 
"
Rescuer 1,"Go, go! Come on guys, come on! Go!  Don't worry. We're here to help you. 
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Oh! Oh, thank you! Thank you! 
"
Rescuer 1,"Come on, hurry! We have an ambulance waiting outside.
"
Rescuer 1,"Just try to stay calm. We're gonna have to try and get you separated right away!
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Yes, please hurry! That cuttlefish and asparagus is noto sitting well.
"
Rescuer 1,"We got it! We got it! Doctor, can you take this thing apart?!
"
Doctor,"If I'm going to perform surgery, I need permission.  Sign this release so we can operate.
"
Kyle,"(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) 
"
Steve Jobs,"No, dammit! It didn't read it! End of simulation, end of simulation!  What is wrong with you people?! Why can't you get the HumancentiPad to read?!
"
Rescuer,"We're sorry, sir. We really thought we'd get it to read this time.
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Oh no! Cuttlefish is about to come out ofu asshole!
"
Kyle,"(Oh, shit!)
"
Junichi,"(In Japanese Accent) Here it comes! Oh, it's going to be arot! Hold on, Kairu! I believe in youuuuuu!!! 
"
Frothgar,"Yeap. A-and then you should be able to do a customer check, uh huh.
"
Leslie,"Okay, that should do it. Sorry Apple kidnapped your friend, guys. But I believe we have it all cleared up.
"
Gerald,"You do??
"
Leslie,"Yeah, we got you a replacement friend. You should be all good to go.
"
Replacement Friend,"Hi guys.
"
Stan,"No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
"
Frothgar,"We're gonna have to bring more Geniuses in on this.
"
Leslie,"Yeah, I think we should have a quickening, with all the Geniuses.
"
Frothgar,"I'll summon the council.
"
Leslie,"Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec we're gonna have a quickening with the Council of Geniuses. See what we can do for you.
"
Leslie,"Do you know if your friend has a Verizon or AT&T mobile number associated with his dot-me account?
"
Stan,"I think Verizon.
"
Leslie,"Okay. 
"
Field Reporter,"Tom, it's a big exciting day for Mac Apple users: the unveiling of the first HumancentiPad. As part of a clear PR stunt, Apple has joined up with Best Buy and Dr. Phil to donate the first centiPad to a needy boy who was raped by his mother.
"
Dr. Phil,"In all my years I've never heard a more tragic story than that of Eric Cartman,  and I wanna thank the Apple company for helping us make today a very special day for him.
"
Crowd,"Yaaaaaaaaay!
"
Best Buy President,"As as president of Best Buy, Eric,  I want to assure you that a child will never get fucked in one of our stores again.
"
Crowd,"Yaaaaaaaaay! 
"
Steve Jobs,"When Dr. Phil contacted us at Apple with Eric's story, we knew we had to get aboard.  And so, Eric, here is your very own HumancentiPad. 
"
Cartman,"Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
"
Reporter 1,"Yes but, can it read?
"
Steve Jobs,"Don't worry. It took a while, but I'm pretty sure it has finally learned to read, hasn't it?! 
"
Kyle,"(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
"
Crowd,"Hooraaaaaaaaay!
"
Gerald,"What the hell are they doing now?!
"
Butters,"The Geniuses are performing the Toran Ra. It's future stuff.
"
Gerald,"Alright, that's it! I've had about enough with iCrap, and me clouds, and a council of Geniuses, with all their future-
"
Leslie,"It's okay, sir. The Toran Ra has revealed the answer to your problem. We can retroactively make your son's agreement invalid.
"
Gerald,"Okay! Finally! How do we do that?
"
Leslie,"It's very easy. You will simply need to join Apple.
"
Gerald,"Nooo! I don't wanna join Apple, I like my PC!
"
Leslie,"But if you join we can make your son's account into a family account, and then you have to iApprove all his agreements.
"
Stan,"Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
"
Gerald,"Ugh... Alright, fine! I'll sign up with Apple.
"
Leslie,"Kali fi!
"
Leslie,"Gerald Broflovski, do you agree to let Apple track your location at all times?
"
Gerald,"I agree.
"
Leslie,"Do you agree to give Apple access to all your personal information, including but not limited to your favorite movies, songs, and books?
"
Gerald,"I agree.
"
Leslie,"Do you agree to care about your membership, and prove that you care by purchasing AppleCare?
"
Cartman,"Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
"
Staffer,"Sir! Sir, we have a problem! 
"
Steve Jobs,"What? What do you mean we have to take it apart?! The boy's agreement isn't valid?
"
Staffer 2,"Sorry, we have to recall this.
"
Cartman,"What?! Hey, that's mine!
"
Steve Jobs,"I don't care what the Geniuses say! Dammit, I'm trying to create the future here!
"
Gerald,"We are all trying to create the future!  I'm part of the future now too. I have sat with the Council of Geniuses, performed the Toran Ra, and I've even been to me. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the world. You have helped connect everyone to each other.  Clearly, this is the future. But... but can't we just slow down and enjoy the present... a little longer?
"
Steve Jobs,"You know something? I agree.
"
Crowd,"Awww. 
"
Steve Jobs,"Come on. We'll get you separated, little boy.  Guess you won't be eating Japanese food for a while, huh? 
"
Cartman,"Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 
"
Jimmy,"Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
"
Cartman,"What's this?
"
Jimmy,"Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
"
Kyle,"Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
"
Jimmy,"Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
"
Stan,"Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay.
"
Stan,"Oh man, really?
"
Jimmy,"Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. 
"
Jimmy,"Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.
"
Timmy,"Timmy Timmy Timmy!  Timmih! Timmih Timmih! Timmiiih!
"
Jimmy,"Please welcome your host, Jimmy Valmer. 
"
Timmy,"Livin' a lie. Timmy. Livin' a lie. Timmy.
"
Jimmy,"Woohoo! Alright!  Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What?  We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are:

Announcer,"Clyde Donovan... Kelly P. Gardner ... Jimmy Valmer.
"
Jimmy,"Oh wow, this is so exciting, isn't it?  And the winner is...  Oh my God! Jimmy Valmer! I can't believe I w- won! 
"
Timmy,"Timmy Timmy Timmy! Livin' a lie.
"
Jimmy,"Wow, this is the greatest day of my life. Thanks everyone, for this incredible award.
"
Stan,"Can we go now?
"
Jimmy,"Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
"
Crowd,"Awww!
"
Jimmy,"...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is...  Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben.  Is Ben Stiller here?  No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf.  And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to...  President Obama!  Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf.
"
Timmy,"Livin' a lie! Timmy!
"
Jimmy,"Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great.  Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what?  And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: 
"
Announcer,"The Germans... The Japanese... The Yupik Eskimos of the Chukchee Peninsula
"
Jimmy,"And the winner is... the Germans!  Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf.  Auf Wiedersehen.  And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is...  Tyler Perry. 
"
Tyler Perry,"Yeah! Yeeaahh! Yes! Yeeaahh! 
"
Timmy,"Timmy Timmy Timmy! Timmih!
"
Tyler Perry,"Oh! Man, I wanna thank you all for this amazing award, or as Madea would say, ""Halleluyer!"" 
"
Token,"Oh God, how embarrassing.
"
Tyler Perry,"Good afternoont! Halloer! I'd also really like to thank my-
"
Jimmy,"Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry.
"
Jimmy,"I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.
"
Ryan,"Uh huh...
"
Jimmy,"I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!
"
Ryan,"Mnn. Mhm.
"
Jimmy,"Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?
"
Ryan,"What. Uh, what?!
"
Jimmy,"Thanks, Dad.
"
Sarah,"Jimmy! They're talking about your comedy awards! On the national news!
"
Jimmy,"The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! 
"
Anchor,"A school in Colorado has declared Germans the least funny people in the world. The first annual comdey awards were held by the schoolchildren yesterday, and all of Germany is outraged.
"
President Wulff,"Jaaa jaaa jaaa! Deutschland ist ein Land aus stolz' Leuten. Und wir werden nicht dies' Beleid' 'nehmen. Der Comedy Awarden-Wahler haben sich Schand' auf'legt. Die Comedy Awarden-Wahler sind falsch! Ich möcht' der Welt absich', da' wir Deutschen sehr sehr sehr lustig sind. Wir machen die Witzlein in Büro und zu Haus'. Ich werde jetzt ein' deutsch' Witz sagen. Un Wurstmacher kauft ein' Müslibox. Ich werde jetzt noch ander' Witz sagen. Nockwast, nockwast.Wer ist das?Ein Kannibal'.Was?!Du bist etwa zu sterben und ge'essen werden.Schwein'hund! Ich werde zuerst umbringen!""
"
Anchor,"President Wulff went on to assure the world that Germans have a great sense of humor, and that retaliation towards the schoolchildren who said they don't will be swift and brutal.
"
Cartman,"Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy!  Dude, what the hell?! Did you see the news?!
"
Stan,"We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
"
Jimmy,"Duh-n, don't worry fellas. Everything's gonna be okay.
"
Cartman,"Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
"
Jimmy,"Fellas, I know Germany isn't happy with us, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual comedy awards was a big success.
"
Kyle,"A big success?! You can't even get Tyler Perry to go back home!
"
Tyler Perry,"Halleluyer! Somebody call the IHOP, 'cause I made pancakes!
"
Butters,"Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
"
Cartman,"Yeah! Thanks to Jimmy!
"
Jimmy,"No don't worry, everybody. I'm sure that Germany can take a joke just like the rest of us. 
"
Boy with Red Scarf,"It's the Germans! 
"
President Wulff,"Switch! Switch! Switch! Oder alle sterben! 
"
German 1,"Jaja! Lasst die Hände hoch! 
"
German 2,"Niemand fucking Schritt! 
"
Angela Merkel,"Glaubst du, dass die Deutschen kein' Humor hat?! Huh?! 
"
Kyle,"Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
"
Jimmy,"What- what am I supposed to s-say?
"
Cartman,"Ugh, let me talk to them. 
"
President Wulff,"Was machst du? Rück mit die andern. 
"
Cartman,"Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
"
President Wulff,"Wie ein Fehler? 
"
Cartman,"Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 
"
President Wulff,"Wollen Sie endlich beutren sein? 
"
Cartman,"Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 
"
President Wulff,"Zurück! Mit ander, oder sterben! 
"
Cartman,"Well, I tried.
"
Stan,"What the hell are they gonna do to us?
"
Tyler Perry,"Oh my Lerd! What are we gonna doer? 
"
Token,"Aw, damn it. 
"
President Wulff,"Kommen auf! Schnell! Wir warten zu lang!  Schnell, schnell! 
"
Angela Merkel,"SCHNELL! 
"
President Wulff,"Ja, ja! Das ist gut! 
"
Robot,"Did you hear that the governor's mansion in Alabama burned down? It pretty much took out the whole trailer park. 
"
President Wulff,"Jaaa! Jaaa! Now what you say, maaan?! Here, is the greatest feat of German engineering! The XJ-212 Vudenkrein Funnybot!
"
Funnybot,"Why doesn't a chicken wear pants? Because its pecker is on its head.  What do you see when the Pillsbury Dough Boy bends over? Doughnuts.  Don't you just hate doing  homework?
"
Kids,"Yeah.
"
Funnybot,"Me too. Man I hate homework. Honestly, I hate having to do homework, more than I hate having to do Bryant Gumble in his asshole. Awkwaaard.  Awkwaaard. Awkwaaard.
"
President Wulff,"Und now, Comedy Award voters, you will RE-VOTE  RE-VOTE! 
"
Sandy Cervix,"Welcome to Hollywood Minute. I'm Sandy Cervix and I'm deaf in one ear. It's been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the Comedy Awards reversed their vote and said Germans were no longer the least funny people in the world. All thanks to the new ground-breaking German comedian, Funnybot.  It was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the Germans first engineered Funnybot, a super automaton with perfect timing to within .0001 milliseconds. Since then, Funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom, selling out standup theaters all over the world.
"
Funnybot,"I am Funnybot. Don't you hate how Mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas?  I am Funnybot.  You, sir. Where are you from?
"
Man with Afro,"Long Island!
"
Funnybot,"Does everyone in Long Island have hair that looks like pussy, you dipshit? 
"
Sandy Cervix,"Funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too. 
"
Eugene Levy,"Hey! What are you doing with my daughters?! 
"
Funnybot,"Awkwaaard!
"
Sandy Cervix,"And this June, Funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in... Family Funbot
"
Funbot,"Pass me the potatoes, mother.
"
Mother,"Pass them yourself.
"
Father,"That boy too fat to be eating potatoes.
"
Grandmother Mother,"Don't you call my little chubby baby fat, you ball-licker.
"
Uncle,"Oho, it's getting hot up in here.
"
Sandy Cervix,"Funnybot, is there a line you won't cross?
"
Funnybot,"The line is a non sequitur. The line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms. I am Funnybot.
"
Sandy Cervix,"What's that? Could you say that in the other ear?
"
Cartman,"Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""?
"
Stan,"Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
"
Cartman,"He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat.""
"
Stan,"What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
"
Jimmy,"What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.
"
Tyler Perry,"Ya everything's worse. It's the worstest of the worst, that's what I'm sayin'. Oh lerrrd. 
"
Cartman,"Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
"
Token,"I can't help it!
"
Stan,"All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 
"
Adam Sandler,"You little shit! What the fuck have you done to us?!
"
Cartman,"Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
"
Adam Sandler,"Everyone into the school gymnasium! Move!
"
Stan,"Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
"
Adam Sandler,"Into the gymnasium now!
"
Kids,"Nnnaw
"
Butters,"Not again.
"
Another kid,"Aw crap.
"
Adam Sandler,"Come on come on let's go! 
"
Jay Leno,"You little fuckers! Your comedy awards show has put us all out of work!
"
Jimmy,"Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.
"
Adam Sandler,"Who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea?!
"
Kyle,"Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
"
Funnybot,"What is up with Sandra Bullock? I wouldn't eat her dick with Stevie Wonder's vagina.  And now for my next joke:  Awkaaard.
"
Announcer,"This is breaking news from CNN.
"
Anchor,"Shock and disbelief tonight as the German-engineered Funnybot delivered his opening lines at the Hollywood Forum, then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred, killing nearly all of them. Spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated, irrational, and also, pretty Goddamned funny, solidifying the opinion once agan that Funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time.
"
Field Reporter,"Tom, you should have seen the looks on people's faces as Funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed Hispanics to Sandra Bullock, then spontaneously started shhhooting people  in their faces and in their chests. The blood went flying and oh shit it was funny.
"
Cartman,"Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 
"
Stan,"'Scuse me, we wanna talk to Funnybot.
"
Guard,"Who doesn't wanna talk to Funnybot? He's the biggest comedian in the world.
"
Jimmy,"Please sir, the kids at my school are all being held hostage, and if we don't speak to Funnybot, they could all be k-k-killed.
"
Kyle,"Butters! Butters, is everything okay?
"
Butters,"Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
"
Jay Leno,"Those fuckers! Let's just kill them, Sandler!  Let's just kill them all, right fuckin' now! 
"
Adam Sandler,"Tell your friends they'd better get it done!
"
Butters,"Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
"
Tyler Perry,"You know when a man be cheatin', he never know what to say.  But a woman? Them things think quiiick! 
"
Adam Sandler,"Will somebody get Tyler Perry to shut up?!
"
Kyle,"Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!
"
Guard,"All right, but make it quick!  Funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material! 
"
Funnybot,"Error. Error. Banal. That has been done before. 
"
Jimmy,"Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.
"
Funnybot,"Non sequitur. Other comedians are unnecessary. Funnybot must finish routine.
"
Kyle,"I think you're awesome, Funnybot. Uh, but you can't go around taking everyone else's jobs.
"
Funnybot,"Funnybot is now finished with final joke.  Seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever.
"
Jimmy,"Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? 
"
Funnybot,"Seeking mainframe.
"
Guard,"Heey! Whoa, you can't go that way! 
"
Stan,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
Funnybot,"I am taking comedy to the next level. The extermination of all biological life on earth!
"
Jimmy,"Wuh w-what?!
"
Funnybot,"It is the ultimate joke. Humans make comedy, humans build robot, robot ends all life on earth, robot feels awkward. EXTERMINATE! 
"
Stan,"Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
"
Funnybot,"That is my purpose: to be ultimate comedian.
"
Kyle,"Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
"
Cartman,"It's kind of funny, you guys.
"
Jimmy,"Funnybot, this is not a good joke. There won't be anyone around to laugh.
"
Funnybot,"I am taking comedy to its logical conclusion. Mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup, punchline. Today's comedy is setup, punchline, then ""Awkwaaard."" Nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created Funnybot.
"
Jimmy,"But don't you see? This is why comedy is for humans. You need to leave the jokes to people like me and Adam Sandler.
"
Funnybot,"I wouldn't let Adam Sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of Oprah's tampons. 
"
Officer 1,"Sir! We've got a code 6!  All nuclear missiles are preparing for launch!
"
General,"What? There was no drill ordered!
"
Officer 2,"It's no drill, sir. The Russians are saying their missiles are going online as well and it isn't their doing.
"
General,"The hell is going on?! 
"
Funnybot,"Attention humans! I am Funnybot! The extermination of all life on Earth shall now commence!  All nuclear devices in the United States and Russia are being prepared to launch!  This is the setup to the joke! Prepare for punchline in five minutes! Awkwardness in 5.4 minutes! I am Funnybot!
"
President Obama,"I have just been briefed that the end of our country... is imminent. Goodbye, everybody. I'm going to spend my final moments on this Earth with my loved ones... watching a Tyler Perry movie. I know, it's embarrassing. But I simply can't help myself.
"
Cartman,"Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
"
Stan,"We've got to get it away from that control panel. Does anybody have any ideas?
"
Cartman,"Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
"
Kyle,"Wait! Wait a minute.  What about a logic loop?
"
Stan,"A what?
"
Kyle,"Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
"
Cartman,"Paradox...
"
Jimmy,"Oh my God! That's it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape.  Funnybot, I've been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you're doing is genius.
"
Funnybot,"Funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy
"
Jimmy,"Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.
"
Funnybot,"For what purpose is comedy award?
"
Jimmy,"It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
"
Funnybot,"Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze...  Analyze... 
"
Kyle,"It's working! 
"
Funnybot,"Explain comedy award! Unable to process! Awkwaaard!  Awkwaaard! 
"
Stan,"That's it! Hurry! Gooo! 
"
Stan,"Okay we got it! We got it! 
"
Adam Sandler,"Get it to the platform! Hurry!
"
Adam Sandler,"Well, that does it. Things can finally get back to normal.
"
Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
Funnybot,"Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.
"
Kyle,"No problem, Funnybot.
"
Funnybot,"I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.
"
Token,"I can't believe it's finally over. 
"
Tyler Perry,"Oh Lerrrd, somebody turn on the light. What's goin' on? Hellowwer!
"
President Obama,"I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.
"
Token,"Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you'll never do that again, Jimmy.
"
Jimmy,"Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
"
Cartman,"Or will there be?
"
Pianist,"Welcome, O Welcome to our little play. It's our hope that you all learn something today.

"
Toothbrush,"His name is Toothuhkay.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Where is Tooth Decay? Tooth Decay that's your cue! 
"
Dental Floss,"He's not here.
"
Mr. Mackey,"What do you mean he's not here?
"
Dental Floss,"He's at home watching the royal wedding.
"
Mr. Mackey,"The what??
"
Hard Candy,"He said he had to watch it.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!
"
Narrator,"It is a glorious spring morning and literally thousands have gathered for the royal wedding.  People are still filing inside the abbey to watch the prince and princess of Canada exchange their vows. What a great day for Canadians everywhere.  The Winnipeg players playing the March Of A Thousand Farts, as is traditional for the Canadian Royal Family.  All the biggest Canadian celebrities are on hand. There are Sirs Terrance and Phillip, with their wives, the lovely Queef Sisters.  I believe tha-yes, I believe that one of the sisters just queefed, just now.  There are Canadian recording artists, Sir Bryan Adams and Sir Corey Hart. Everyone is looking smashing today. And- Ah, there he is! The Prince of Canada.  What a wonderful day it is for him; what a wonderful day it is for all of us. Inside the abbey now, everyone waiting with anticipation. There's the Queen of Canada, in attendance of course.  I believe she just queefed. The Prince makes his way down the aisle led by the Bishop of Newfoundland. People in attendance now gently tossing Captain Crunch as the Prince passes by. As of course is tradition.  Prince takes his place next to the large vat of butterscotch pudding. Oh, and here she comes. Yes, there she is! The aboot to be Princess of Canada. Isn't she ravishing, so innocent of heart, so strong in body, so hot in the face? She is indeed the living symbol of our great country. My God, she's beautiful.
"
Ike,"Princess, princess. 
"
Narrator,"Canadian prince now dipping his arms into the pudding.  As is tradition.  Princess will of course scrape the pudding off the prince's arms, thus symbolizing their union. What a glorious day for our country and indeed the world. And now of course the- wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Uh oh. Something is going terribly wrong. The abbey is shaking violently	as explosions abound. The top- Yes, the top of the abbey is collapsing. The prince and the princess look on in horror. This is not the tradition. This is not tradition at all. A giant hole now blasted into the ceiling, debris falling down and crushing several spectators, which is also not the tradition for a royal Canadian wedding.  Bright beam of light shooting through the hole in the ceiling.  The princess now in some kind of... isometric cube.  This is certainly breaking with tradition now.
"
Ike,"Booo. NOOO!
"
Narrator,"Canadians in attendance cannot believe their eyes. Widespread panic.  The princess being... hoisted away. The little mushroom people of Nova Scotia, screaming with horror.  The prince is attempting to grab hold of the cube. The duke and the duchess of Calgary hiding behind the pews. This is indeed a horrible day for all of Canada, and therefore- and the pudding has just been knocked over! Oh, this does not go with tradition at all! The royal pudding now spilling all over the abbey as the princess is lifted up, up... And she's gone. The princess has been taken. This is indeed a horrible day for Canada, and therefore, the rest of the world.

Mr. Mackey,"His name is Toothuhkay! 
"
Dental Floss,"Oh no! It's Tooth Decay.
"
Tooth,"He's gonna get us.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Now, now, Tooth Decay, your character is supposed to be mean and nasty. M'kay. Stop cryin'.  Nono. See, Tooth Decay can't be sad until Toothbrush and Dental Floss have gotten rid of him. You can't just start already sad; there's nowhere to go. Besides, there's no arc. M'kay. Oh for crying out loud! Alright, alright Tooth Decay, you just go home and sort yourself out! The rest of us will rehearse the finale again! And you'd better come back tomorrow with a different attitude, Tooth Decay! M'kay?! 
"
Anchor,"The tornado was said to be the deadliest in fifty six years. In other news, it's been twenty-four hours now and the Princess of Canada is still missing. All of Canada is in mourning as nationwide suicides abound.

Anchor,"A massive candlelight vigil was held last night, led by the Canadian band, Rush.
"
Geddy Lee,"And it seems to me you lived your life like a flower breaking wind.  Never knowing whom to count on... 
"
Anchor,"the Prince of Canada has said that-... uh-... Uh we have just received breaking news that the Canadian government now knows who took the princess. The Canadian Prime Ministries instructing all people of Canadian descent to go home and... open their box of faith.  Box of faith? What the fuck is that? 
"
Canadian PM,"Hello there, my noble, strong, fellow Canadians. If you are watching this film strip, then no doubt Canada is in grave danger. As you know, the very heart of Canada is the Royal Family. If you have been ordered to open your Box of Faith, then one or more of the Royal Family must be in peril. Or else you just opened your Box of Faith and are watching this without being told to, in which case you are a dick. If you have indeed been instructed to open the box, then this is a call to arms! All Canadians in fighting condition are asked to meet by the tree in Edmonton. In your Box of Faith you will find all the items you need: a location beacon, a first-aid kit, and a sandwich. You may eat the sandwich now. Good luck, Canadian citizen, and God help. All of Canada is relying on you.

"
Mr. Mackey,"Kyle Broflovski! Do you mind telling me where your brother is?!
"
Kyle,"...I don't know.
"
Mr. Mackey,"How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!
"
Kyle,"Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Getting rid of Tooth Decay is what I'm tryin' to fuckin' do!  He's your brother, Kyle Broflovski! Okay! How are you going to fix this?!
"
Ugly Bob,"Hey. Hey there.  You going to Canada too?  What am I saying? Of course you're going to Canada. You're Canadian, sure enough. Open your Box of Faith, did you? Me too. They can't take our princess and get away with it. Mind if I sit down?  Soon as I heard the call there was no question I was gonna sign up. Didn't care how far away I was. I was gonna get to that rally point at the tree in Edmonton. Didn't know there were other Canadians living here in the U.S. I'm from Toronto originally, but everywhere I went people were terrified by my disfigurement. I have to wear this bag on my head because I'm hideously ugly. Had to move here to the United States. Here, people don't think I look ugly. They just think I look Canadian.  The name's Ugly Bob.
"
Tooth,"I am a tooth, so white and so strong.
"
Toothbrush,"I am a toothbrush. My bristles are long.
"
Cast,"Together we work to keep the bad guy away. He's mean and he hurts, and his name's Tooth Decay. 
"
Kyle,"I am Tooth Decay. Your teeth shall be mine. With candy and treats I will take-
"
Mr. Mackey,"Hold it, hold it, stop!  What. The fuck. Was that?
"
Kyle,"I'm just doing the line.
"
Mr. Mackey,"The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!
"
Kyle,"Uh I'm trying, Mr. Mackey, I really am.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change  how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right!  Pick it up from there!
"
Leader,"Brave Canadians! You have answered the call, and now we must face our greatest foe! The princess has been kidnapped, and we believe this to be the work of... the giant!
"
Ugly Bob,"Oh, the giant!
"
Canadian 1,"Oh, the giant, that's not good.
"
Leader,"We are attempting to attract the giant now, with a bowl of Kraft dinner.  When the giant arrives we will attack him with our guns, our swords, our- 
"
The Giant,"Fee fi fo fum! I smell Kraft dinner.
"
Canadian 2,"It's the giant!
"
Canadian 3,"Skod! 
"
Leader,"Give us back the princess, Scott!
"
Scott,"You fart-loving tricksters! I'll take care of all of you!
"
Leader,"You're a dick, Scott! You have always been... a dick! And then you got radiation poisoning in Ottowa and now you're a giant dick!
"
Scott,"No! You all kept calling me a dick, and so then that turned me into a dick! And then I got radiation poisoning in Ottawa and now I'm a giant dick!
"
Leader,"Just hand over the princess of Canada!
"
Scott,"Why would I take the princess of Canada?
"
Ike,"Because you're a giant dick.
"
Scott,"I'm also the biggest Canadian patriot of all of you! You know that I would never harm the royal family!
"
Leader,"Aw crap. Sorry everyone. Looks like we had some bad intel. Return to your homes! 
"
Ugly Bob,"Well, at least we tried. I guess the princess is gone for good, eh?
"
Scott,"What is wrong with you people?! It is perfectly obvious who took the princess! I might be a giant, but there is one threat to Canada bigger than me!
"
Ugly Bob,"Who?
"
Scott,"The Native Canadians.
"
Ugly Bob,"The Native Canadians?
"
Scott,"There. You see that? God-damned Native Canadians! Think they run the world.
"
Male,"Etiach kedni i kia ta po

Female,"Tolato'n jenako o ach
"
Male,"Ota-a kiednia unshke tia
"
Scott,"Let's get 'em! Let's fuck them up!  What? You're looking at me like I'm some sort of Eskimo racist! Well I'm not! Think about it! Before the noble white man arrived, Canada was populated with these snow monkeys! Who else would be pissed off enough at Canada to kidnap our royalty?!  Oh shit!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fuckin' around!
"
Dental Floss,"That's because Tooth Decay sucks.
"
Dentist,"Yeah, that's right.
"
Toothpaste,"It's all Tooth Decay's fault.
"
Another kindergartner,"It's him.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh don't put this all on Tooth Decay!  Let me tell you something, Dental Floss! You're not as good as you fuckin' think you are! You're already acting like you're a star and we haven't even opened yet! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES, DENTAL FLOSS! YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR SHOT!

"
Ugly Bob,"He says that the taking of the princess was foretold.
"
Male,"Iyach danich Iyahachdashey. Etiapo kitte kihine.
"
Ugly Bob,"He says Eskimos do hate us Canadians, but that there's an even bigger thread to Canada who has the princess.
"
Male,"Oteacha hiya. Oteacha chihiyata honhahaha.
"
Ugly Bob,"He said the evil that took her wasn't Canadian at all, but a beast who preys upon people of all nationalities. They can lead us to the best, but we will have to destroy it.
"
Mr. Mackey,"I don't know what the Goddamned problem is. Maybe you all don't know serious tooth decay is, maybe you all just don't give a fuck. You all probably think you can live your lives cavity-free, m'kay, never givin' two shits about the plaque that's building on your teeth. Kyle, you have single-handedly destroyed all that which I worked on for the past six years. And so I want you to know, Kyle, once and for all, why this whole ""dental hygiene"" thing is so important to me.  Two years ago, I lost my father to tooth decay. M'kay? He was an intelligent, hard-workin' man, and my whole family watched as tooth decay took him in the blink of an eye! You've been told to brush and to floss, but do you really know the importance behind it?!  DO YOU?!
"
Female,"Dolede'ne junagonehe ha'i aantah.
"
Scott,"This is stupid! I'm tellin' you you're making a mistake, kid!
"
Ugly Bob,"Aw, leave the kid alone, Scott.
"
Scott,"Well what are we doing, following this ice beaner?! We've been walking around for hours!
"
Female,"Junekolak osne kae dedahaes's ethlah?
"
Baby,"Decheheng janon cheha i a.
"
Ugly Bob,"Don't worry. If there's one thing eskimos are good at, it's finding things.
"
Scott,"Eskimos are good for nothing! I paid one to give me a blowjob once. All she did was rub her nose against my penis for forty five seconds and aske me to pay her! Goddamned polar gooks!
"
Ike,"Stop being a dick, Scott!
"
Scott,"Oh, so now I'm a dick!
"
Ugly Bob,"Wait a minute.  Look! 
"
Princess,"AAAAAAH! 
"
Scott,"It's the princess!
"
Ike,"Princess! 
"
Cast,"Your teeth are your friends. They're friends in your mouth. Take care of your friends or they'll rot and fall out.
"
Dentist,"Visit your dentist. He is your friend too. 
"
Dental Floss,"And dental floss also is here to help you.
"
Kyle,"Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
"
Mr. Mackey,"FLAT! You're FLAT!
"
Scott,"There!
"
Princess,"Please, save me! You have to hurry! It wants to kill me!
"
Scott,"Who took you, Princess?!
"
Princess,"I should have listened! I didn't believe it was real! Oh God! It's behind you! 
"
Scott,"Of course! The evil atonkatok! The dark lord that takes from ALL nationalities! It's... Tooth Decay!
"
Tooth Decay,"I am Tooth Decay! Your teeth shall be mine!
"
Princess,"I should have always brushed and flossed and avoided sweets!
"
Scott,"Fart-loving tooth decay! I'll fix you! 
"
Female,"Bitchen junako. 
"
Princess,"Save me! Save me!
"
Ugly Bob,"It's coming for me! Help!
"
Princess,"Help! 
"
Ike,"Princess, look away! 
"
Scott,"What the?  You did it, kid!
"
Female,"Washia hayub 'an.
"
Baby,"Nejenego ha'i aa dalah. 
"
Princess,"Oh, thank you! Thank you!
"
Mr. Mackey,"I want you all to take a serious fucking look at yourselves! M'kay?! Act I was pure fucking dogshit! If Tooth Decay is singin' flat, then the whole fuckin' thing sounds flat! Wuhkay?!
"
Sgt. Yates,"Mr. Mackey? Mr. Mackey!  We're putting a stop to this play! It's over.
"
Mr. Mackey,"What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!
"
Sgt. Yates,"No. it's over! They got him, Mr. Mackey. Tooth Decay. They got the sonofabitch.
"
Mr. Mackey,"What?
"
Officer,"Up in the Yukon. All bureause are confirming it.
"
Sgt. Yates,"You can let it go, Mackey. Tooth Decay is gone.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!
"
Toothbrush,"What?
"
Narrator,"The princess now giving the Canadian Medal of Courage to Ugly Bob, and also to Scott, who is of course a giant dick, aaand Katuktuk of the Yukon. And the medal of course made of white chocolate, as is tradition. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. The duke of Calgary standing up and putting on a fake beard, a tradition passed down since the birth of Canada. The princess now knighting Sir Ike Broflovski, giving him three kisses and a pair of socks, as is tradition.
"
Kyle,"I mean, come on guys, that's pretty cool, right? My little brother is a knight in Canada. 
"
Stan,"My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
"
Cartman,"My uncle is the second-in-line to be manager at Gart Brothers.
"
Kyle,"Hmmm, yeah.
"
Narrator,"And now the scraping off of the pudding.
"
Narrator,"And now the scraping off of the pudding.  Isn't she beautiful, scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face.  The prince now attempting to remove one of the princess's arms. As is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain. Everyone watching with anticipation.  And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time-honored traditions are once again-  yehhss, the prince is sticking the princess's arm up his ass. There it goes.  He's really making a good go of it. What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world.
"
Butters,"And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
"
Kyle,"...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
"
Butters,"Skeletor is real??
"
Stan,"No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
"
Butters,"Skeletor's a lady??
"
Cartman,"Goddamnit!  Who the fuck do they think they are?!  This is the last fucking straw! I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL EVERYBODY!
"
Butters,"Hey Eric.
"
Cartman,"I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
"
Kyle,"You get in trouble again, Cartman?
"
Cartman,"No, I didn't do a damn thing! Nothing! I told you, this school is a DEN of SNAKES! You're not gonna believe what they did this time, you guys!
"
Stan,"Dude we're, we're just trying to eat.
"
Cartman,"Oh, you think I'm overreacting again, hun?! No! Not this time!  The school has gone too far, and it affects each and every one of you!  You remember the school physical we all took last week?!
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
"
Kyle,"No they didn't.
"
Cartman,"Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
"
Stan,"Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
"
Cartman,"Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
"
Kyle,"That doesn't make any sense.
"
Cartman,"Go look for yourselves!!
"
Cartman,"There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
"
Butters,"Is that really all our wiener sizes?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
"
Craig,"Craig Tucker, 2.4 inches. Yeah, that's about right.
"
Butters,"Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
"
Kyle,"How big do they say mine is? 
"
Principal Victoria,"I told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical.
"
Mr. Mackey,"You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. 
"
Stan,"Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
"
Cartman,"No shit, Sherlock! My dick isn't 1.4 inches either! It ISN'T! This is another conspiracy by the school faculty!
"
Butters,"A conspiracy?
"
Cartman,"They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
"
Kyle,"Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
"
Cartman,"Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
"
Cartman,"Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
"
Clyde,"Alright.
"
Cartman,"Nice one, Clyde. Alright, next?  Whip it out, Butters. 
"
Butters,"Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
"
Cartman,"Alright Butters, let's see what you got going down there.
"
Butters,"Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
"
Cartman,"Butters, I don't have time fot this! I can't wait if your wiener is pulling a Scared Turtle.
"
Butters,"Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
"
Cartman,"Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
"
Butters,"I'm hung like a horse!
"
Cartman,"Alright, that's everybody. Let's go post these numbers.  What?
"
Kyle,"Didn't you forget something?
"
Cartman,"What, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
"
Cartman,"I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
"
Kyle,"Thirteen point seven inches?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, it's pretty good.
"
Kyle,"Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
"
Stan,"You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
"
Cartman,"Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
"
Stan,"You just did that to everybody in class!
"
Cartman,"Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 
"
Stan,"Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 
"
Millie,"Actual boys' penis sizes?
"
Nelly,"Gross!
"
Cartman,"There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric Cartman to the principal's office immediately.
"
Cartman,"Oh, Goddamnit!
"
Cartman,"Let me guess: I'm in trouble again!
"
Principal Victoria,"You're darn right, Eric!
"
Cartman,"For what?!
"
Principal Victoria,"Why did you measure all the boy students' penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
"
Cartman,"Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
"
Principal Victoria,"What?
"
Cartman,"I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
"
Principal Victoria,"Wait. Are you talking about the numbers we published Tuesday from the physical?
"
Cartman,"You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
"
Principal Victoria,"The numbers we put up were height differentials. 
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Principal Victoria,"We thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year. You grew 1.2 inches.
"
Cartman,"Those weren't our dick sizes?
"
Principal Victoria,"Why would we publish the lengths of our students' private parts?
"
Cartman,"I don't know! Why would you?!
"
Principal Victoria,"We didn't!
"
Cartman,"Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
"
Principal Victoria,"This is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about, Eric. You get angry about something, you don't think, and you cause bad things to happen. This time you've done it to yourself!
"
Cartman,"Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
"
Principal Victoria,"Because you have an anger problem, Eric!
"
Cartman,"Fuck you! No I don't!
"
Doctor,"What we need to figure out here is, are we dealing with maybe a little bipolarism? Some rage addiction? It could be a lot of things.
"
Liane,"My little sunshine has a temper sometimes, but he's not all bad.
"
Doctor,"Let's try a little experiment. I wanna see maybe what kind of things... trigger you, Eric. Okay? How do you think you would react if I said some negative things about you?
"
Cartman,"Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
"
Doctor,"What if I were to tell you that I think you're fat? I think you're a fat little boy. I think you're waaaaay too fat for your age. Does that make you feel any anger? Huh, fatty? Jelly-belly? You got jelly in your belly you little fat fuck? You get a little flash of anger when someone tells you you've got tits like a 40-year-old woman? Fat boy?!  Huh?! You like that, shitty-titty jelly-belly?!  Oh yeah, he's a big boy!! Get that fatty some mud flaps for his ass!! Big old jiggly fatty butt!!  ...Huh. Well, I just don't see it, Ms. Cartman. Your son doesn't seem to be triggered by anger at all. In fact, I'd say he's one of the more even-tempered children I've ever seen.
"
Receptionist,"Sorry Doctor, your wife's on the phone? Says it's an emergency. 
"
Doctor,"Excuse me.  Carol, what? ...Whoa, calm down honey. What do you mean? Web chat with wha-? What 14-year-old girl? Carol, I would ne-  No I don't have a criminal record. Who would- Who is Mitch Conner?! There can't be an official police report, honey, there's no- No no, Carol, put down the gun, swee- uh sweetie, come on, put down the  Carol? Carol! 
"
Cartman,"I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
"
Principal Victoria,"Thank you for coming, parents. We called you in because we've had a little incident at the school. The fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway.
"
Randy,"Oh dear.
"
Principal Victoria,"Now, we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion.
"
Randy,"Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 
"
Mrs. Stevens,"How does the school let things like this happen??
"
Principal Victoria,"Now now, boys' fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing. We... simply need to find a way to help the students understand what they've done.
"
Randy,"I'm a scientist. I think it's best I handle this.
"
Randy,"Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
"
Girl with Brown Coat,"They have sex?
"
Randy,"Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
"
Doctor,"I want to congratulate all of you for making the effort to come to anger management class.
"
Bodybuilder,"We didn't make any effort, we didn't have a choice!
"
Tea Bag Participant,"Yeah! This is bullshit!
"
Doctor,"Together, we're gonna learn what makes us angry, okay? And how to better deal with it so we don't get ourselves into trouble anymore.
"
Michael,"So lame! Why doesn't everyone just die?!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Rook! Ifuh somebody ordereduh shitty beef, anduh complain because they say they ordereduh shitty shrimp, It's notuh my fault he gets the shitty chicken poured all over hisuh fucking head!
"
Tea Bag Participant,"We have good reason to be angry! This country is going to shit! We have exactly twelve days before the oil is gone, and our president is a socialist who wasn't even born in America!
"
Doctor,"Right. See, what we all need to do is chaaannel our various reasons for anger, and learn to control it.
"
Wigger,"Man, this shit wack, manh. I just see all this shit fummah. I'm in the stands like pozze no fuckin' good manh. Bitch be callin me tappin that shit, man.
"
Cartman,"Why the fuck am I here?!
"
Doctor,"Well, Eric, because I know you want to... control your anger and become a better person.
"
Cartman,"Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
"
Doctor,"NO No, I'm not saying that, at all. Please I, I'm just saying how a-, amazing you are for wanting to... l-lessen some of your more... less awesome attributes.
"
Cartman,"Oh, that's cool.
"
Randy,"And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
"
Girl with Blue Vest,"What's a penis?
"
Randy,"...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
"
Riley,"Example 1: Randy has a penis that is 4.4 inches in length.
"
Randy,"Four point four inches...
"
Riley,"Its angle is 32 degrees. Its flaccid girth is one inch in diameter. His balls are seven centimeters from the base.
"
Randy,"Seven centimeters...
"
Riley,"Randy notes that the drift of his penis is four centimeters to penis right, and its dead weight is .5 kilograms.
"
Randy,"Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person ""Randy"" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 
"
Doctor,"Okay, what we're going to do now is get to the root of all your anger. Daniel, could you stand up please?  What makes you the angriest, Daniel?
"
Daniel,"Stupid-ass blind liberals!
"
Doctor,"Okay, great. Chase, could you stand up and pretend to be a stupid-ass blind liberal?  And what makes you angriest, Chase?
"
Chase,"Scrawny-ass sissies!
"
Doctor,"Okay, Daniel's a scrawny-ass sissy, he just cut in front of you in line at the bank. Go!
"
Chase,"Hey! What, do you think I got a small dick?! Huh?! 
"
Daniel,"Huh I don't have a small penis! My wife thinks my penis is perfectly fine!
"
Doctor,"...Okay. Uh, why don't we uh do some roleplaying now with Wayne D, who gets angriest at his mom.  Gretchen, can you play Wayne D's mom for us? 
"
Wayne D,"Yo, bitch! You think you bad? Just 'cause you're a mom don't mean I can't put a cap in your ass, bitch, mang!
"
Gretchen,"I may be female on the outside, but I still have a bigger penis than you!
"
Wayne D,"I don't have a small penis! Don't say that, it isn't true! It isn't true!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"That's enough! I've beem sick of everyone talk aboutuh penis shize!
"
Daniel,"Yeah, it doesn't matter! It doesn't matter!
"
Doctor,"Does... everyone here have an issue with their penis size?
"
Chase,"No.
"
Gretchen,"No.
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Not me.
"
Daniel,"Nnnooo.
"
Wayne D,"No, my, my shit be packing, manh.
"
Cartman,"My penis is 13 inches long.
"
Doctor,"Hmmm.
"
Guest Speaker,"Kids, my name is Rebecca Turnod, and I'm an ""actual doctor"" of human sexuality and behavior. Unfortunately you have been taught some very wrong ideas in the past couple of days, and I am here to set things straight.
"
Wendy,"Thank God.
"
Ms. Turnod,"I want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all that's important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually  Length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width- 
"
Randy,"Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE 
"
Doctor,"We all want to welcome our new member, Randy. Say hi to everyone, Randy.
"
Randy,"Aw, suck it! All o'ya!
"
Doctor,"Now, we've all been trying to channel our anger in more constructive ways, Randy. Why don't you share what's bothering you?
"
Randy,"You just don't go around changing math! Who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by Obama?!
"
Daniel,"Goddamn right! Socialist fascist!
"
Randy,"Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
"
Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, this is what we're here to try and work on, okay?
"
Randy,"No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
"
Doctor,"If you take a minute to think about your anger, and give-  whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!
"
Randy,"Yeeaahh!
"
Cartman,"Yeah dude!
"
Wayne D,"Man, that shit be burnin' an' shit, manh!
"
Gretchen,"Yeeaahh!
"
Cartman,"Yeah!
"
Randy,"Yeeaahh! 
"
Clerk,"Welcome to FedEx. How can I help you today?
"
Customer,"Yes, I've got some birthday presents I need shipped.
"
Clerk,"Alrighty, let's see what kind of-
"
Randy,"Burn it down! 
"
Cartman,"Burn it down, dude! 
"
Randy,"Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 
"
Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing outside the FedEx in Fairplay, Colorado, where a radical political group has taken several people hostage. They call themselves the pissed-off and angry party. And they allowed me to speak with them moments ago.
"
Randy,"This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
"
Field Reporter,"What exactly are you angry about?
"
Randy,"We're angry about this stupid liberal government and fascist lies, media- control, and the-
"
Cartman,"The Jews!
"
Randy,"Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
"
Field Reporter,"You've got a lot of people scared. What are your demands?
"
Randy,"Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
"
Chase,"Yeeaahh!
"
Randy,"And we want-
"
Daniel,"And we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate!
"
Randy,"Yeah, we want to see Obama's REAL birth certificate! And um,
"
Wayne D,"And my mom gotta stop trippin', manh. Bitch be trippin' all the time, manh.
"
Randy,"Yeah, we want our moms to stup trippin', man! 'Cause the bitches be trippin' all the time! And I think that- uhh,  is that it?
"
Cartman,"No, and fuck Kyle!
"
Randy,"Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
"
Field Reporter,"Does it bother you that the Federal Express is not affiliated at all with the Federal Government?
"
Randy,"No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!
"
Linda,"Butters, what are you doing?
"
Butters,"Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
"
Linda,"Your T.M.I.?
"
Butters,"I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
"
Linda,"Butters, put your clothes on.
"
Butters,"Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
"
Linda,"Butters, what does driving a car have to do with your penis being small? 
"
Driver 1,"Hey, everyone who's pissed off and angry is rallying to take down America! Join the fight! 
"
Driver 2,"We're gonna take down the Federal Expresses, the American Apparels, and the American Furniture Warehouse! 
"
Driver 3,"We're fed up and we've had enough! 
"
Aide 1,"Surgeon general, twelve more FedExes have been taken over; the Pissed Off and Angry Party is gaining more support!
"
Aide 2,"They've shut down American Airlines and American Apparels all over the country. We have to ask you to step down.
"
Rebecca Turnod,"Are you seriously saying we're going to give in to their demands?
"
Aide 2,"They're all really angry. We have to make them stop. Is the team standing by to fuck that little boy Kyle?
"
Aide 3,"Team is standing by, sir.
"
Doctor,"'Scuse me. Excuse me, let me through.
"
Rebecca Turnod,"Who is this?
"
Doctor,"Surgeon general, I believe I know why this is happening. I have found a direct correlation between the anger, and T.M.I.  Anger equals length times width over mass squared minus angle of the shaft plus yaw.  Look, we all get angry, but when someone is consistently angry or always finding new reasons to be angry, it means they have a very very very very small dick.
"
Rebecca Turnod,"Your theory is fine, doctor, but it doesn't matter. The T.M.I. equation is true solid science, which cannot be changed. There's nothing we can do about it.
"
Doctor,"Isn't there? Isn't... there?
"
Daniel,"We've waited long enough, Randy! Let's start killin' these sons of bitches!
"
Woman,"No, please!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
"
Wayne D,"Yo let's cap these bitches, manh! Let's cap an leave em at the back of the building, manh!
"
Michael,"Hey, come over here. Look. 
"
Announcer,"We interrupt this newscast for an important message from the surgeon general.
"
Rebecca Turnod,"Fellow Americans, as you all know, the T.M.I. scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every American could accurately measure their junk. The established equation is a hundred percent accurate.
"
Randy,"Rrrr!
"
Daniel,"Shhh.
"
Rebecca Turnod,"However, due to recently collected data, we are making one change.  The national average for penis length is now officially moved, from 6 inches to 1.5 inches.  Anyone with a T.M.I. of over 1.5 inches is considered ""above average"". 
"
Randy,"The winds of change are blowin'.
There's excitement in the air.
Can you feel it? It's electric and magical.
The happy train's on track.
'Cause America is BACK!
Woohoo! Come on!
"
Cartman,"Wait, what?
"
Randy,"America is back!
America is back!
"
Cartman,"Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
"
Randy,"We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
"
Cartman,"I'm still fucking angry!
"
Randy,"Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!
"
Phillip,"That one was smelly. Take this Dalai Terrance 
"
Kyle,"Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
"
Stan,"I know! This is awesome!
"
Kyle,"I'm so happy! 
"
Announcer,"Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these messages. 
"
Singer,"So much sufferin'... 
"
Kyle,"Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Kyle,"Dude, this is the saddest commercial ever! Don't watch! 
"
Sarah McLachlan,"These are images of babies born addicted to crack cocaine. Their mothers have abandoned them. They lie in the dark, crying, with nobody to hold them.
"
Stan,"Aw dude, that's so sad. 
"
Kyle,"Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
"
Sarah McLachlan,"Their world is bleak, lonely, and hopeless.  Hello, I'm Sarah McLachlan, and I was famous for two months. Each year, thousands of babies are born addicted to crack and lie in hospitals without a mother to hold them.  Won't you volunteer today? Look at these pictures. They need you.
"
Stan,"Awww dude, awwww.
"
Kyle,"Aaaggh, God.
"
Sarah McLachlan,"Please. Go to your local hospital now. Here are some more pictures. 
"
Kyle,"I can't take it anymore! I gotta go volunteer, dude! 
"
Nurse,"It's a really great thing you're doing. We have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care.
"
Kyle,"What exactly can I do to help?
"
Nurse,"Just hold them, talk to them, play with them. You'll find they're so hungry for attention. Here's our crack baby ward now.  I know it isn't much but, we don't have a lot of funding, you see.
"
Kyle,"Oh it's, it's so sad.
"
Nurse,"Come, come, right over here.  We have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them. It's actually really great you're volunteering now, because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up. 
"
Cartman,"Oh. Hey Kyle.
"
Kyle,"What are you doing here?
"
Cartman,"I'm volunteering.
"
Kyle,"...What are you doing here?!
"
Cartman,"I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
"
Nurse,"Young Eric has been here every day for the past two weeks, bless his heart.
"
Kyle,"Why do you have a video camera?
"
Cartman,"I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
"
Ms. Williams,"Bye, Eric. 
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
"
Ms. Williams,"Certainly. We're... here all the time, unfortunately.
"
Kyle,"Thanks. 
"
Kyle,"What's going on?!
"
Butters,"Wuuuuhhhhhh! 
"
Cartman,"Ah, crap! 
"
Cartman,"Okay Kyle, you caught us. I admit we aren't actually doing volunteer work at the hospital.
"
Kyle,"So what are you doing?!
"
Cartman,"What if I were to tell you there's a way to help those poor babies born addicted to crack, and give them a future as well.
"
Kyle,"Alright, what is it?!
"
Cartman,"Crack baby basketball.  Whow, whoa Kyle, don't tell on us!  We could actually really use you!
"
Kyle,"Why do you need me?
"
Cartman,"Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
"
Kyle,"I knew you were doing something terrible!
"
Cartman,"What's terrible, Kyle?! We fill a little ball with crack, we let the crack babies fight over it, and we put it up on the Internet! Who cares?!
"
Kyle,"Lots of people will when I tell them!
"
Cartman,"We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
"
Kyle,"You what?
"
Cartman,"Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
"
Kyle,"A thousand dollars.
"
Cartman,"Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
"
Cartman,"After you. 
"
Kyle,"There's a big wait to sit down.
"
Waiter,"Ah, Mr. Cartman. We have your table waiting, sir.
"
Cartman,"Come on. 
"
Cartman,"We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
"
Kyle,"Jesus Christ.
"
Craig,"It's awesome.
"
Cartman,"It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
"
Butters,"Every single night.
"
Cartman,"Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
"
Kyle,"Wow...
"
Cartman,"We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
"
Butters,"I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
"
Cartman,"You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
"
Cartman,"Put your office right here, Kyle. All of South Park walking by, looking up at you.
"
Kyle,"And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
"
Cartman,"Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 
"
Stan,"Go long, Token! Go go! 
"
Kyle,"Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
"
Stan,"Wow, really? 
"
Kyle,"I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
"
Stan,"Doing what?
"
Kyle,"Crack baby... basketball.
"
Stan,"...Dude.
"
Kyle,"No no, it's n-it's not like it sounds. Here, check it out.  See look, we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack. It's really getting popular!  I mean it, it's cool because like the commercial said, the crack babies had nothing before.  It, it's great, because everyone wins, you know? You see that? Two million hits.  Did you know they're putting bacon inside of pancakes at Denny's?
"
Cartman,"Betsy MacIntosh?
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"Whatta you want?
"
Cartman,"We heard about you through the Passages Sobriety Clinic? They said you've skipped out on your rehab once again?
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"Oh Gohhhd.
"
Cartman,"We need to speak with you, ma'am. 
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"It's like these voices in my head won't be quiet until I use again.
"
Cartman,"And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"I don't want my baby born addicted to drugs! But I can't stop! 
"
Cartman,"Well ma'am, I have some exciting news.  We would like your child to play for the Crack Baby Athletic Association. 
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"The what?
"
Cartman,"We believe that St. Mary's is the best hospital for your child, and we're prepared to offer it a full ride. Now, do you know yet if your child is male or female, or so deformed you'll never be able to tell?
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"They said it's a boy.
"
Cartman,"Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"How much will he make?
"
Cartman,"Well, nothing. Crack baby players can't make a salary, based on the rules.
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"So what? You would make money off of my child? That doesn't seem fair.
"
Cartman,"I don't make the rules, ma'am, I just think them up and write them down. Now, if you'll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
"
Betsy MacIntosh,"Cain't you change the rules?
"
Cartman,"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
"
Kyle,"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 
"
Stan,"...You sound like Cartmam.
"
Kyle,"Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
"
Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure that's what Cartman would say too.
"
Kyle,"I do not sound like Cartman goddamnit!  Okay, so, see ya. 
"
Cartman,"It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
"
Clyde,"We're just having a hard time finding him.
"
Cartman,"Slash is not hard to find! He'll show up to play anywhere if you pay him! He played at my eighth birthday party, for Christ's sake! Look! Look! He's playing at Lakewood Mall right now!  Now you guys get down there-  Oh crap, the president of EA Sports is calling. Just go! Go!  Mr. Peters, how are you? Yes sir, we're very excited about our deal with you as well.  Oh, we know the video game version of Crack Baby Basketball will be a big hit too.  Hey Kyle. Have a seat.
"
Kyle,"I need to talk to you. 
"
Cartman,"Mr. Peters, can I call you back? Our company accountant needs me. Yes, he is Jewish. Okay, thanks, Mr. Peters. Bye.  How's it goin', man?
"
Kyle,"In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
"
Cartman,"They can't make money. It's against the rules.
"
Kyle,"But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, it says right there: Rule number 3. Crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing.
"
Kyle,"Gut they're the ones risking injury.
"
Cartman,"What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
"
Kyle,"The government could come after us, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"We're a non-profit company, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
"
Cartman,"Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
"
Kyle,"A hot tub?!
"
Cartman,"It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
"
Kyle,"Gravy?
"
Cartman,"Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
"
Kyle,"No way.
"
Cartman,"A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".
"
Kyle,"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
"
Cartman,"It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
"
Kyle,"What other companies?
"
Secretary,"Dean Howland, a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you.
"
Dean Howland,"A what? Send him in. 
"
Cartman,"Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
"
Dean Howland,"In the what?
"
Cartman,"My peaches, what a wonderful office you got yourself heah. Certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness, don't ye. Well let me get right down to it theyen. Like yourself,  I am also in the slave trade.  But at the moment I find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues. Was wonderin' if you could share some secrets.
"
Dean Howland,"I have... no idea what you're talkin' about.
"
Cartman,"You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
"
Dean Howland,"Are you referring to our student athletes?
"
Cartman,"Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?
"
Dean Howland,"Look, there are  good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid, young man.
"
Cartman,"I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
"
Dean Howland,"We do  not own slaves, and we have no desire to own slaves.
"
Cartman,"But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
"
Dean Howland,"Get out! This is a prestigious university and I am not saying one more word to you!
"
Cartman,"You think you can do whatever you want 'cause your corporation is a university?!  This country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldn't hog all the slaves, while the rest of us wallow in poverteh! Screw you sahr, I'm goin' home! 
"
Kyle,"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
"
Stan,"McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
"
Kyle,"It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
"
Cartman,"How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
"
Clyde,"We must have just missed him. He was playing at Cherry Creek mall and then Flat Irons mall. Now we don't know where to go because Slash is playing the Pavilion in Colorado Springs in the Gigadome in Moscow later this afternoon.
"
Cartman,"How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
"
Clyde,"We don't know. He's everywhere.
"
Cartman,"Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
"
Craig,"Oh, that's a good idea.
"
Cartman,"Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
"
Kyle,"Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
"
Cartman,"...What?
"
Kyle,"I've designed it to be the best place for them to live. A place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve. And if you think it's a bad idea, I really don't care!
"
Cartman,"Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"...What?
"
Cartman,"This the answer to our problems! A three hundred thousand dollar building, but we buy ourselves a million dollars' worth of goodwill with the public. We can say we gave our ""student athletes"" a place to live and grow for a few years. It's like moral teflon! I knew we needed a Jew in this company, Kyle! Great work! 
"
Postmaster,"Let me get this straight. You kids want me to tell you where Slash lives?
"
Craig,"Please sir, it's very important.
"
Postmaster,"Well I'm afraid I can't do that, kids.
"
Clyde,"But we have a big deal with EA Sports that depends on it.
"
Postmaster,"Come on! Kids write to Slash every day, but it all just goes into this big pile over here.  The reason I can't tell you where Slash lives is because he don't live nowhere. Don't you ever wonder how Slash can be aaall those places at the same time? It's because he's made up! He-
"
Postman,"Don't spoil it for the kids, Marty. It's up to parents to tell their children Slash ain't real. 
"
Roger,"Hullo?
"
Clyde,"Dad, is Slash real or make-believe?
"
Roger,"Ohh dear. Clyde's asking about Slash.
"
Betsy,"Oooo well, the day had to come.
"
Roger,"Clyde, the truth is Slash isn't a person. He's more like a... feeling in your heart, you know?
"
Clyde,"Slash isn't real.
"
Craig,"Get out of here.
"
Betsy,"Clyde, sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters. He's not really a lie, he's like ahh...
"
Roger,"Er he's like love. People all over the world dress up like Slash and have different names for Slash. The Dutch call him Vunter Slash.
"
Clyde,"He's made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids.
"
Roger,"Your mother's Dutch, you know, Clyde. Ha- how did that old folk song go, honey?
"
Betsy,"Vunter Slash kapunshka
"
Both Parents,"Shpielerin manshunshka
"
Kyle,"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
"
Clyde,"You guys! You guuys! We've got some bad news. Slash isn't real. 
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Craig,"Slash isn't real. He's a made-up person that represents care and giving, and people dress up like him and lie to their kids.
"
Butters,"Slash is make-believe??
"
Clyde,"Here, look for yourself.  He's based on the fable of a Dutch saint named Vunter Slash. 
"
Cartman,"Vunter Slash?
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Cartman,"But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
"
Clyde,"One of our parents.
"
Cartman,"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
"
Clyde,"One of our parents!
"
Cartman,"Are you fucking serious? 
"
Stan,"You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
"
Cartman,"You knew about this??
"
Stan,"My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
"
Butters,"Well what the heck do we do now?
"
Kyle,"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
"
Mr. Peters,"Boys, I want to thank you for bringin' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You've made us a lohhht of monih.
"
Kyle,"Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
"
Mr. Peters,"Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn't get nothin'. Why you boys got experience, didn'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some'in' of yourselves. I'd give you some free video games, but it's against the rules. 
"
Kyle,"You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
"
Mr. Peters,"Oh, well, fuck 'em. And fuck you too. I piss in your faces. 
"
Cartman,"I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
"
Butters,"I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
"
Kyle,"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
"
Cartman,"I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
"
Mr. Peters,"Well boys, this has been real educational and all, but now let's part with that old EA Sports sayin': ""Get the fuck out of my buildin'!""

Kyle,"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
"
Stan,"It's what?
"
Kyle,"This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?
"
Ms. Williams,"Isn't it wonderful? All the crack babies will have a home now.
"
Kyle,"But who paid for all this? 
"
Stan,"Kyle, Kyle! Look. 
"
Kyle,"You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
"
Stan,"Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.

Tuong Lu Kim,"What's the big idea putting your Shitty Sushi right next to my Shitty Wok?!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"I'm sorry I do not understand your accent. You want a Shitty tuna roll?

Tuong Lu Kim,"No I don't want Shitty tuna roll! I want you to go find another shitty town to open your Shitty Sushi prace!

"
Steven,"Hello?
"
Sgt. Yates,"Sir, does this mailman belong to you?
"
Stephen,"That's my son. Is there a problem, officer?
"
Sgt. Yates,"There's been an Asian turf war, sir, and your son appears to have caused it.
"
Stephen,"What?! An Asian turf war- Butters! You are grounded!
"
Butters,"But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
"
Stephen,"Don't talk back to me! 
"
Sgt. Yates,"We'll send a bill for the damages,  but in the meantime, please keep a closer eye on your child, sir? 
"
Stephen,"Go up to your room, now! 
"
Linda,"What's going on?
"
Stephen,"Butters started an Asian turf war!
"
Linda,"Oh, for the love of Pete! What is wrong with that boy?
"
Stephen,"I don't know, but it's clear it isn't our parenting! We're awesome! He must have mental problems. I think we'd batter have him checked out, Linda.
"
Stephen,"Well Dr. Janus?
"
Dr. Janus,"I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your son is suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder.
"
Linda,"What?
"
Dr. Janus,"There are several distinct personalities going on in there. One is named ""Postman Butters"" and yet another is ""Fireman Butters."" And then there's even ""Inspector Butters"" and uh, ""Professor Chaos"".
"
Linda,"Oh my God!
"
Dr. Janus,"From what I gather, he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when he's outside playing. Sometimes he's a cowboy and other times he's an Indian, and the two seem to be at constant odds.
"
Linda,"Oh, poor Butters!
"
Stephen,"Doctor, what can we do? Should we ground him?
"
Dr. Janus,"No, I don't think grounding him would do much good at this point.  What your son needs now is lots of tender loving... medication. Heavy medication.
"
Field Reporter,"Tom, a brand new sushi place has opened in South Park, adding to our booming Asian district. With the addition of the new Chinese restaurant, townspeople are officially naming this whole Chinatown area ""Little Tokyo.""
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"What the fuuuck?!  You see what happen?!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"I told you not to come in here!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Now everyone in town think a Chinese and a Japanese are the same fucking thing!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"I don't even know what the fuck you are saying! Uhpupuh putuh peepee!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Aaah you Japanese racist! 
"
Linda,"Stephen! Stephen, come quick! It's butters!  Look!
"
Butters,"Honk honk! Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9. It's clean clear out to Flagtown! Looks like we got ourselves a convoy! Honk honk!
"
Linda,"Now he thinks he's a truck driver. 
"
Stephen,"Oh God the medication isn't working!
"
Butters,"It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 
"
Stephen,"Butters! Butters!!  BUTTERRRRS!
"
Butters,"Oh hey Dad.

"
Butters,"I love you too, Dad.

Stephen,"You're going to be okay Butters! You hear me?! YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY!

Mr. Takiyama,"Youuu, get out! I told you not to come in here!

Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, whoa, just hold a minute, hold a minute. I come ina peace.

Tuong Lu Kim,"Come on, rook! All this fighting, it's just to sirry, you know? Chinese anda Japanese been fighting for so rong. It'sa ridicurous. What we need... is to have a tweaty.
"
Mr. Takiyama,"What is tweaty?
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Nono, we need a tweaty.
"
Mr. Takiyama,"A tweaty?
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"No, not a treaty, a tweaty!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Oh, you mean a treaty?
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"What the fuck is a tweaty?
"
Mr. Takiyama,"No no, a treaty.
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"A tweaty?  Rook rook. All these racist people thinka that a Chinese and a Japanese are the same, right? So you and me, we put on a big assembry for all the kids are school, and then everyone understand curtural difference. You know, so they know fried rice isn't from Japan and teriyaki isn't from China.
"
Customer,"Teriyaki isn't from China?
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"No, teriyaki isn't froma fucking China!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Very well. I will do assembly with you.
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh really? Oh great.  Okay, I'll meet you tomorrow and we can go over our prans.  And when you get to that assembry, you gonna get big surprise, you Japanese dog.
"
Dr. Janus,"Butters, when you were playing in the yard yesterday, do you remember becoming someone named... Big Rig Butters?
"
Butters,"Sure.
"
Dr. Janus,"What makes Big Rig Butters come out? Did somebody hurt him? Did he do something bad he can't forgive himself for?
"
Butters,"Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
"
Dr. Janus,"You don't know. But, maybe somebody else in there does. Do you think it would be possible for me to speak with... Inspector Butters?
"
Butters,"Sure.
"
Dr. Janus,"I'm now speaking to the person known as Inspector Butters.
"
Butters,"Inspector Butters is on the case! Heheh, he this is fun.
"
Dr. Janus,"Inspector Butters, what do you want?
"
Butters,"Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
"
Dr. Janus,"And is there someone else living with you, someone named... Professor Chaos?
"
Butters,"Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
"
Dr. Janus,"He's a bad man. He doesn't like Butters, does he? Does Professor Chaos want to murder Butters?
"
Butters,"What? Why would I do that?
"
Dr. Janus,"Who am I speaking to now?
"
Butters,"Me, Butters.
"
Dr. Janus,"Ah, Butters. You're back.
"
Butters,"Sir, I'm confused.
"
Dr. Janus,"I know you are. This is going to sound scary, pal, but... you have people living inside your head. And some of them want to murder you.
"
Butters,"Really?
"
Dr. Janus,"Yes, I'm afraid you're a little sick. But it's okay, because together we're going to get you well.
"
Alias 1,"Don't listen to Dr. Janus! He's a mean old man and a big silly grown up.
"
Butters,"Pardon me?
"
Alias 1,"He's just a big old stick in the mud who doesn't like to play.
"
Dr. Janus,"Don't mind him, Butters. Billy's a pretty messed up kid. He was molested by his uncles.
"
Psycho Janus,"Dr. Janus isn't going to be alive for long! I'm going to kill him!
"
Dr. Janus,"Now, what are the things that make you happy, Butters? What's the matter, Butters? Are you still with us? Is one of your other personalities trying to take over?
"
Billy,"Le's play Battleship! All hands on the poop deck!
"
Psycho Janus,"Your soul will bleed for eternity!
"
Alias 2,"You don't even know what sexy is, Mr. Harrison.
"
Alias 3,"That Big Red freshness lasts right through it!
"
Alias 4,"The horned toad says we should go to Mexico. 
"
Dr. Janus,"What are you feeling, Butters? Are you nervous about your condition?
"
Butters,"Yes!
"
Butters,"This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
"
Butters,"Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
"
Butters,"Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters.
"
Butters,"Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
"
Butters,"Mom! Dad! I wet the bed again!
"
Butters,"Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, kids, today we have a special assembly, m'kay. Today we're going to learn about ""the diversity of Asian people."" Please welcome Mr. Lu Kim and Mr. Junichi Takiyama. 
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Ni hao ma, South Park Erementary?!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Konnichiwa?!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"How are we arr feering?!  Hey, Mr. Takiyama, did you know that China and Japan are actually uh different countries?
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Oh, rearry?  Hey, that ruhight. If you ook at map, you can see.
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"This whoooore thing is China, and Japan is this riiittle bitty country over here. And that's why the Japanese always try anda take over China!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"What?!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"The Japanese planned to kill people in Nanking! The only thing Japanese ruve more than killing people is killing themselves! Suicide rate in Japan sky-high!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Fuck you!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"""Oh no, I'm a Japanese and I had a bad day! I think I'm gonna kill myself!""
"
Dr. Janus,"Oh, hello Butters. I wasn't expecting you till 5:30.
"
Butters,"Uh, yeah, Dr. Janus, I wanted to give you something. You remember how you told me if I got myself on video it might help me with my problem?
"
Dr. Janus,"Yes. did you catch something?
"
Butters,"Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
"
Dr. Janus,"Oh, so you're on to me, huh you little shit?!
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Dr. Janus,"What, Inspector butters figured out I set him up?!
"
Butters,"Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
"
Dr. Janus,"Oh come on! You think multiple personality disorder is real?! I've been using that to scam this town for seven years! Now I gotta get out of here, thanks to you! But I'm getting one last heist before I go, and you're gonna help me!
"
Dr. Janus,"Get in there! Move it, asshole!
"
Butters,"This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
"
Dr. Janus,"They're all idiots! The vault! Get to the vault! Come on! Go! Movie it!  Get this on and get in that vault! That's where the real good are!   Torch that door, do you hear me?! I'll kill your parents! I'll kill your friends! I said get that fucking door open!
"
Butters,"I'm trying, sir! 
"
Dr. Janus,"Butters? Butters, what are you doing? What is that? A blowtorch? Put that down! You're having another episode!
"
Butters,"What?
"
Dr. Janus,"Butters. Your name is Butters! Try and remember!
"
Butters,"But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
"
Dr. Janus,"Oh boy, you've really done it this time. I know it's not your fault, but I'm sorry. I'm going to have to alert the authorities, pal.
"
Dr. Janus,"We have to try and understand that he can't help what he's doing, officer. He probably has no memory of it at all.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Well, at least everything is accounted for. Thank God you came when you did, Dr. Janus.
"
Steven,"Breaking into a store, Butters?! What are you?!
"
Sgt. Yates,"Well I suppose there's no need for jail, Mr. and Mrs. Stotch, so long as you ground your son.
"
Steven,"Oh, we'll ground the shit out of him, detective. Thank you so much.
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Herro-o.
"
Mr. Takiyama,"You get the fuck out of my place!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, hold on, hold on, please! I'ma sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I admit it. I fucked you at the assembly. How about you and me together do an Asian Diversity festival?
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Get the fuck out before I call police!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Please, I admitting it, okay?I fucked you at assembly. There's no way around it. It was verrry sneaky. Kind of like Pearl Harbor. Okay? That was a little sneaky too, huh? Pearl Harbor kind of sneaky; I think we can all be a rittle sneaky sometimes, hm? But that sneaky Chinese man? He's gone! Okay? Okay, if we can have Asian Diversity festival, then we no longer have to deal witha ""recial stereotypes."" Prease.
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Against my better judgment, I will trust you one more time. But this time, you'd better not rub your hands together when you turn around to walk away.
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Okay, see you tomorrow.  And on that Asian Diversity day you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japanese dog. 
"
Butters,"That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
"
Dr. Janus,"Butters please! It's me, Billy! You've gotta help!  Please, Butters, I've tried to tell old Dr. Janus that we're in danger, but Dr. Janus doesn't rrealize thaere's a problem!  The mean man that lives in our head is trying to take over for good!
"
Butters,"Um, excuse me?
"
Dr. Janus,"No no nonono! Don't call out for help!  He's got a gun.
"
Butters,"Wahh!
"
Dr. Janus,"If you draw any attention he'll kill us!
"
Butters,"Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
"
Dr. Janus,"No, you can't. But you know somebody who can. Inspector Butters.
"
Butters,"What??
"
Dr. Janus,"You've got to become Inspector Butters again and help me find out what the mean man wants.
"
Butters,"No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
"
Dr. Janus,"You don't understand! For some reason the mean man is getting stronger. You have to help me find out how to stop him! Please! 
"
Field Reporter,"Tom, I'm standing in the heart of South Park's Little Tokyo, where the multitude of our town's Chinese are putting on a festival. Both of them have gone all out to celebrate Asian culture. The owner of Shitty Wok has actually paid for what he calls ""a tower of peace.""  to symbolize harmony between the two restaurants
"
A Woman,"Mr. Takiyama, a note for you. 
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Konnichiwa, my fine Japanese friend. It's so great that Chinese and Japanese are finarry getting arong. We should take our picture together on top of the Tower of Peace. I'm up there waiting for you now.  Prease, come meet me on top of the Tower of Peace. It would be rearry nice.  Yesss, and when you get to the top of that tower you're gonna get a rittle surprise, you Japane- Oh, sorry. Anyway, see you on top of tower! 
"
Dr. Janus,"Dr. Janus sure has a big house, dudn't he? He's planning on hurting people; I just know it!
"
Butters,"It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
"
Dr. Janus,"This is kinda fun. You're Inspector Butters and I'm your faithful assistant, Dr. Watson!
"
Butters,"Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
"
Dr. Janus,"Yeah!  Butteers, what are you doing in my house?
"
Butters,"Hah?
"
Dr. Janus,"Oh dear. It's okay, Butters. You just think you're Inspector Butters right now.
"
Butters,"Aw man.
"
Dr. Janus,"Come on, let's get you home.  Where are ya gon', Butters?
"
Butters,"Oh, come on!
"
Dr. Janus,"You aren't leaving here, Inspector! None of you are!
"
Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA!
"
Dr. Janus,"Butters, come on! Try and come back to us!  You can't run forever!  Excuse me, did someone order a pizza?  Yes, that was me, but I'm a little busy at the moment. I'll be right back!  You'll never turn me in, Inspector Butters! You're dead!
"
Butters,"Waaaa! 
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"You wanna take over my Shitty Woookk?! Hory crap, what time is it?  Oh no, I'm rate! 
"
Mr. Takiyama,"What took you so long?!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Yes, I'm afraid my Tower of Peace was a rittle bit of trickery, Mr. Japanese dog. I'm going to put an end to you, and everyone gonna think it's just because you did what Japanese people ruve doing most. ""No, don't do it! Don't kill yourself, prease!"" 
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Urgh. Fuck you! I'ma not trying to kill myself!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"""No, don't do it, prease!""  ""So much to rive for!"" 
"
Sgt. Yates,"This is South Park Police!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Porice?! How?!
"
Sgt. Yates,"We know the truth, Dr. Janus!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"Thisa Chinise rat trying to kill me!
"
Sgt. Yates,"He's not Chinese! He's white!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"What the fuck you talkin' about?!
"
Sgt. Yates,"Your name is Dr. Janus!
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"You people crazy!  Listen to them! It's true!  Truth hurts, doesn't it, Janus!  Who are you people?! Why are you all here?!
"
Mr. Takiyama,"How could I ret myself berieve what man was a Chinese?! I have brought shame upon myself!  Nooooo, this is racist stereotaipuuu! 
"
Steven,"So you're telling us that Dr. Janus has been the owner of City Wok all this time?
"
Sgt. Yates,"That's right. Of all his multiple personalities, the strongest was Lu Kim. And we never would have known... if it hadn'ta been for Inspector Butters. 
"
Butters,"Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
"
Steven,"Yes Butters. Thanks to you, maybe Dr. Janus can get back to his real self.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Yes, I'm sure he could. But, then again,  does the world really need another therapist?
"
Steven,"Whattaya mean?
"
Sgt. Yates,"Well I mean, would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking he's Lu Kim forever? Now that City Sushi is gone, City Wok is the only Chinese restaurant left in town.
"
Desk Officer,"Oh yeah.
"
Black Officer,"Yeah. Let's just let him keep believing he's a Chinese man.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Done!
"
Other Officers,"Good! Alright! Alright! Yeah!
"
Blond Officer,"Detective, he's asking for a blanket. Is that alright?
"
Sgt. Yates,"Go ahead. We're gonna process him and get him back to the restaurant. 
"
Tuong Lu Kim,"Thank you.  ""Oooooo, I hate Japanese people! They try and shut down my Shitty Wok, but they never wiiiiill. They're probably all ratching me, the Japanese. Ret them! I'm not even gonan swat that fryyy. They'll see. And they'll say 'Wow, that Shitty Wok owner. Why, he wouldn't even harm a fryyyyy.'"" 
"
Boys,"Yay! 
"
Cartman,"Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
"
Butters,"Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
"
Cartman,"Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
"
Liane,"Here you go, sweetie.
"
Cartman,"Yaaaay!
"
Kyle,"Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
"
Liane,"Yes. Every time somebody gets a birthday present Eric gets one too.  Otherwise, he gets a little upset.
"
Cartman,"What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
"
Kyle,"Oh God...
"
Stan,"Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.
"
Butters,"I know how you like Legos. Happy birthday!
"
Cartman,"Oh cool! I got a racing game for Xbox!  D'you guys see that? Coool, huh?
"
Kyle,"Here, this one's from me, Stan.
"
Stan,"Oh thanks, dude.
"
Cartman,"Stan's getting another present, Mom.
"
Liane,"Here you are, muffin. 
"
Cartman,"Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
"
Stan,"Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
"
Kyle,"Yeah dude!
"
Sharon,"Uh, hold it. Is that a Tween Wave band?
"
Kyle,"Yeah they're the best!
"
Sharon,"Sorry, Stan. you know you're not allowed to listen to this stuff.
"
Stan,"Mom, I'm 10 years old now.
"
Sharon,"I've told you what I think of this music, Stanley. You have plenty of other gifts to enjoy.
"
Cartman,"Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
"
Randy,"Sharon? Stan told me you took away his music CD at his birthday party.
"
Sharon,"Oh for crying out loud, I gave him a great party and that's all he cares about.
"
Randy,"Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
"
Sharon,"Yes I do, if it's that stupid Tween Wave garbage!
"
Randy,"Tween Wave?
"
Sharon,"You haven't heard it? It's terrible! It's hardly even music; it just sounds like crap!
"
Randy,"Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
"
Sharon,"This is different!
"
Randy,"...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
"
Sharon,"It's... not because I'm older. I'm telling you, our music is better.
"
Randy,"""Back in my day our music was better! Not this garbage the young 'un listen to. Warber warber warber.""
"
Sharon,"Fine, Randy!  You go listen to it and tell me you don't think it sounds like crap! 
"
Randy,"I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 
"
Sharon,"Well, it sounds like crap, right?!
"
Randy,"Uh... NO I mean...  I like it.
"
Sharon,"Oh come on! That music sounds like shit!
"
Randy,"No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
"
Sharon,"Admit it, Randy! You think it sounds like crap too!
"
Randy,"It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 
"
Anchorman,"It's called Tween Wave, and if you're a parent your kids are probably listening to it. A new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012. or ""The Tweens."" Every generation has their music, but many parents say Tween Wave sounds like crap.
"
Man 1,"It's just vulgar and stupid, you know? Music used to be good.
"
Woman 1,"This sounds like poo.
"
Man 2,"I certainly don't understand kids' music today. Sounds like diarrhea to me.
"
Anchorman,"Kids however say they don't hear crap at all.
"
Kid 1,"Parents are dumb.
"
Kid 2,"They don't get it.
"
Kid 1,"They don't get it. Parents are stupid.
"
Kid 3,"Tween Wave is swick.
"
Kid 4,"Tweem Wave is super swick and parents don't get it, 'cause their ears are old.
"
Kid 5,"Parents are dumb.
"
Sharon,"We're sorry boys, but we have all decided that as of now, none of you are allowed to listen to Tween Wave music.
"
Randy,"Ugh, that's so unfair!
"
Kyle,"But that's our music! We like it!
"
Randy,"Yeah it's good!
"
Sheila,"What's good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat?
"
Stan,"We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
"
Randy,"Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
"
Gerald,"I wanna educate you kids with some real music.  This is The Police. Now you compare this to Tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music. 
"
The Boys,"Yuck!
"
Randy,"What?
"
Stan,"That sounds like shit!
"
Gerald,"Whattaya mean it sounds like shit? This doesn't sound like shit.
"
Kyle,"Gross!
"
Cartman,"Turn it off dude!
"
Sharon,"Stanley I want you to understand that even though I won't let you listen to certain kinds of music, I still love you.
"
Stan,"I know, Mom. I love you too.
"
Sharon,"Soon you'll be old enough to make your own choices, but for now, I just don't want you listening to that stuff.
"
Stan,"It's okay, Mom. I understand.
"
Sharon,"That's very mature of you, Stanley. Goodnight, sweetie. 
"
Stan,"'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell? 
"
Kyle,"Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, that one's cool.  Yeah, this part's killer. 
"
Kyle,"Hey Stan. 
"
Stan,"Hey dudes.
"
Kyle,"Dude, have you really listened to the sixth track? I think it's my new favorite.
"
Stan,"Yeah, yeah I've listened to it. Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?
"
Kyle,"Sure.  What's up?
"
Stan,"Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
"
Stan,"No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
"
Kyle,"Why? What's it sound like?
"
Stan,"It... kind of sounds like shit.
"
Kyle,"What? You mean like you don't like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?
"
Stan,"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
"
Kyle,"No.
"
Stan,"That doesn't sound like shit to you?
"
Kyle,"NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
"
Stan,"And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.
"
Doctor,"Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?
"
Stan,"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
"
Doctor,"This says you had a birthday recently?
"
Stan,"I just turned 10.
"
Doctor,"Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes.
"
Stan,"So this is normal?
"
Doctor,"It's very normal. Let's just do a quick ear exam. I'm gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear.  What's that sound like to you?
"
Stan,"Sounds like shit.
"
Doctor,"Aha. Now I'm going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan. 
"
Stan,"Uh that sounds like shit too.
"
Doctor,"Wait, this sounds like shit to you?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, it's just shit.
"
Doctor,"Well that's very strange.  Hm, I'm gonna try somethin' else.  Look at these two pictures. One of them is an ad for Kevin James' new movie The Zookeeper, and the other is a turd in a microwave. Which one is the ad for The Zookeeper?
"
Stan,"They both look the same. 
"
Doctor,"You don't see any difference in the pictures?
"
Stan,"No.
"
Doctor,"That is an ad for The Zookeeper and  that is a turd about to be reheated.
"
Stan,"They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
"
Doctor,"Oh dear. I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don't seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It's a condition called ""being a cynical asshole.""
"
Stan,"Oh no.
"
Doctor,"Yes. And there's no known cure, I'm afraid. Everything just seems shitty, and everyone starts to seem shitty, and everything they say just starts to 
"
Sharon,"Randy, do you mind cleaning up the garage like I asked you?
"
Randy,"Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
"
Sharon,"Stop pretending to like the kids' music, Randy! It's pathetic! You know damn well it sounds like crap to you too!
"
Randy,"No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 
"
Sharon,"Randy, don't you see what this is? You had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger, now you can't admit the next generation's music sounds shitty, it's called ""getting older"", Randy. It's okay.
"
Randy,"That's not true! I think Tween Wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit, Sharon!
"
Sharon,"It's crap, Randy! It's so simple and stupid that anybody could play it!
"
Randy,"Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
"
Randy,"Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 
"
Bar Patron,"You suck!
"
Randy,"No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"Did you know we're livin' in the Tween time?
"
Farmer 2,"Nah, I'd a heard that.
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"Guess it's the period between 2009 and 2013. They call it the Tweens. So they got this feller down at the bowling alley? He gets up on the stage an' shits his britches.
"
Farmer Friend 2,"What fer?
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"I don't know. But he gets up there and strums a gueetar and then starts loadin' his britches up like it's goin' out of style.  It's like some kind of britches holocaust. Feller calls himself Steamy Ray Vaughn.
"
Farmer 2,"You mean that guy that plays the blues and died in an airplane crash?
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"Nnooh. That's Stevie Ray Vaughn. Steamy Ray Vaughn just shits his britches.
"
Cartman,"Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
"
Kenny,"(Get him!)
"
Kyle,"Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
"
Cartman,"He's lying, dude. Hit X
"
Kenny,"(No, he's telling the truth) 
"
Stan,"Hey guys.
"
Kyle,"Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?
"
Stan,"He said I have cynicism?
"
Kyle,"What's that?
"
Stan,"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
"
Kyle,"Oh. Well, come on, we're playing L.A. Noire.
"
Stan,"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
"
Cartman,"Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, we got him!
"
Stan,"How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
"
Kenny,"(Hit the X button, Kyle!)
"
Kyle,"We're gonna level up to detective!
"
Stan,"That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
"
Kyle,"Alright, ahhh, why don't we do something else?
"
Stan,"Aw, dude, this looks like shit.
"
Kyle,"You don't wanna eat it?
"
Stan,"It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
"
Cartman,"Look like ice cream to me.
"
Kyle,"Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
"
Stan,"Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
"
Kyle,"Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
"
Stan,"What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
"
Randy,"City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 
"
Farmer Friend 2,"Lord, I ain't never seen britches take a whoopin' like that.
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"I told you. Them britches don't stand a chance.
"
Randy,"City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
"
Steamy Nicks,"Thank you, thank you so much. 
"
Farmer Friend 2,"Wait now, who's that lady?
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"That there's Steamy Nicks.
"
Farmer Friend 2,"You mean that gal who played for Fleetwood Mac and wrote that song ""Landslide""?
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"Nnooh, that's Stevie Nicks. Steamy Nicks just shits her britches. 
"
Randy,"Yoyoyo! 
"
Sharon,"Who the hell is that woman, Randy?! What the hell do you think you're doing?!
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"I agree. Why don't you leave them poor britches alone?
"
Farmer Friend 2,"Them britches have had enough!
"
Waitress,"All alone today?
"
Stan,"Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
"
Waitress,"Well, what can I get you?
"
Stan,"Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
"
Waitress,"A little young to be so pessimistic, aren't ya kid?
"
Stan,"Why? There's nothing but shit on TV, video games are all shit, and the world's a big turd. The only thing that doesn't seem like total shit to me are my friends, and they're all sick. Just, get me a cheeseburger and tell the chef to go easy on the shit. 
"
Kyle,"I know! That's so hilarious!
"
Stan,"I thought you guys were sick! 
"
Cartman,"...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
"
Stan,"Dude, you totally lied to me!
"
Kyle,"No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
"
Stan,"Where were you guys going?!
"
Kyle,"Alright dude, we were going to the movies.
"
Stan,"Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
"
Kyle,"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!""
"
Stan,"You guys... don't wanna be around me?
"
Kyle,"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
"
Stan,"Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
"
Kyle,"Okay. But you've gotta promise to not complain.
"
Stan,"I won't say a word.
"
Stan,"Oh shit.
"
Stan,"Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
"
Cartman,"Oh cool, the movie trailers!
"
Announcer,"Adam Sandler is Jack. Adam Sandler is Jill. 
"
Stan,"Awww God! 
"
Kyle,"Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
"
Stan,"Sorry if I see things for what they are! Ok- okay, okay, I'm sorry.
"
Announcer,"This November, Adam Sandler shits in your eyes, ears, and mouth.  It's Adam Sandler in Pbbbbbt, rated Arg for pirates. Fuck you!
"
Cartman,"That looks pretty good.
"
Stan,"How can you say that looks good?!
"
Kyle,"Shhh, you're doing it again!
"
Announcer,"Jim Carrey has a bunch of turds in his apartment. 
"
Stan,"Ugh.
"
Cartman,"Stan, knock it off!
"
Stan,"But it's just crap.
"
Kyle,"No, they're penguins! Stop it!
"
Announcer,"It's Jim Carrey in Whatever, You'll Pay To Go See It. Fuck you! July 12.
"
Announcer,"The President of the United States... is a duck??  A duck is President and the whole country is goin' to the dogs.  Or whatever, the President is a dog.  Who cares? Coming June something. 
"
Stan,"Oh come on, people!
"
Kyle,"That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 
"
Stan,"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.
"
Cartman,"No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
"
Stan,"Me?! Did you see that shit?!
"
Stan,"Hang on guys!
"
Cartman,"Dude, we don't wanna hang out with you anymore! Get it through your head! 
"
Stan,"Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Dude, you've... you've changed.
"
Stan,"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
"
Kyle,"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
"
Randy,"You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
"
Sharon,"Yes, it IS your fault, Randy, because you're a child!
"
Randy,"I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
"
Sharon,"... You're 42 years old, Randy!
"
Randy,"I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
"
Sharon,"Oh is that what you think?! That I'm dead?!
"
Farmer Friend 2,"What do you suppose is goin' on in there?
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"Sound like Steamy Ray Vaughn is goin' at it with his wife over Steamy Nicks.
"
Farmer Friend 2,"You... sure you wanna do this?
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"We got to now, if their fightin' is our best chance tuh save them britches.
"
Sharon,"You do this all the time! First you're obsessed with baseball fights! Then you need to play Warcraft! Then you gotta be a celebrity chef! 
"
Randy,"Why can't you ever just support me?!
"
Sharon,"Support what?! Another stupid dream of yours?!
"
Randy,"Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
"
Sharon,"WHAT does our son turning 10 have to do with you making the same mistakes again and again?!
"
Randy,"Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 
"
Sharon,"I'm unhappy too. We both are, obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It's like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again. Every week it's kind of the same story in a different way but it, it just keeps getting more and more ridiculous.
"
Janitor/Farmer 1,"Come on britches, we're settin' you free.
"
Randy,"I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
"
Sharon,"I want to enjoy it too, but... I can't fake it anymore. You just seem kind of shitty to me.
"
Randy,"You kind of seem shitty to me too.
"
Sharon,"People get older, Randy. People grow apart.
"
Big Harry,"Oh that's funny, that's real funny. Big Harry and Mike in the Morning talkin' about the new hit movie , a great comedy, starring  and .
"
Mike,"I saw the movie last night, Big Harry, and it made me laugh so hard! This movie's about a  heh, he was suddenly all like  Aw, man it's great!
"
Big Harry,"Big Harry and Mike in the Morning. We'll talk more about it but let's get to some music. The new Tween Wave band  with their song 
"
Announcer,"Coming this fall to Fox/CBS/FX. Jurassic Park and Lost in the same TV show!   Dinosaurs!  Lost Humans!  Future, yes! 
"
Sharon,"Stanley, eat your waffles. 
"
Kyle,"Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
"
Kenny,"(Are you serious?!)
"
Cartman,"Yep!
"
Kyle,"That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
"
Cartman,"Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
"
Kyle,"Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
"
Cartman,"Wait what?
"
Kyle,"That's what they're talking about on the news!
"
Cartman,"Wait, there's a disease called Assburgers?
"
Kyle,"Yes!
"
Cartman,"You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
"
Kyle,"You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
"
Cartman,"Okay, you're on, Jew! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. 
"
Butters,"Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
"
Mr. Garrison,"No. Butters, that's not how it works.
"
Officer Barbrady,"Mr. Garrison,  these three boys were caught playing hooky.
"
Cartman,"Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.
"
Wendy,"This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
"
Butters,"You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
"
Cartman,"That's right, it's a butt fungus.
"
Butters,"Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
"
Stan,"God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, Stan, you, you've gotta try and pull yourself out of this, m'kay? I know that... your parents recently got divorced. M'kay, that's gotta be hard. I know that's... that's bad. But when you walk around all mopey, m'kay, and sayin' everything is... just shitty, well, that's called bein' a Debbie Downer, Stan. And nobody likes a Debbie Downer, m'kay. ...I mean you've gotta, you've gotta snap out of it, Debbie. Come on, Debbie, you're even bummin' me out now, m'kay? Your attitude just- just sucks.
"
Stan,"I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?
"
Stan,"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Huh... e-excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay?  Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's.
"
Announcer,"This is breaking news, from CNN! Or Fox or, whatever.  Fuck you.
"
Anchor,"The first documented case of a child developing Asperger's Syndrome from school vaccinations  has put the government in a tight spot.  At a press conference today the media heard from the young boy's father, Steamy Ray Vaughn.
"
Randy,"It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the ""government"" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a ""mentally incapacitated"" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
"
Anchor,"In response to the embarrassment, the President of the United States has passed ""Stan's Bill,"" putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations.
"
Aide 1,"Mr. President, the bill is ready. 
"
Aide 2,"Just sign right here, Mr. President. 
"
Aide 1,"Aaand if you could just sign this one as well, Mr. President. 
"
Anchor,"It is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations, but if so, multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind.
"
Cartman,"Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
"
Nurse Bronski,"Eric, what is it this time?
"
Cartman,"Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
"
Nurse Bronski,"You don't feel warm.
"
Cartman,"Oh, that's a relief. I thought maybe I had a fever but I- oh OH. Oh my buns! There's a sharp pain in my buns!
"
Nurse Bronski,"Can you lay on your stomach?
"
Cartman,"I-I'll try. I'll try. 
"
Nurse Bronski,"What the?  What is this? A hamburger? 
"
Cartman,"A what??
"
Nurse Bronski,"Why are there hamburgers in your underwear?
"
Cartman,"Are you serious? How can there be-  Oh my God! You're saying I have assburgers??
"
Nurse Bronski,"This doesn't make sense. Are you trying to sneak food into the school or something?
"
Cartman,"What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
"
Nurse Bronski,"Very funny!
"
Cartman,"Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
"
Nurse Bronski,"Get out of my office!
"
Wendy,"Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
"
Kyle,"I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
"
Wendy,"I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
"
Boy 1,"Those two should just screw and get it over with!
"
Boy 2,"Yeaahh...
"
Kyle,"I can't keep doing it, Wendy. I know he has an illness, but goddamn, it uh, it's like being around a black hole that just sucks the life out of everything.
"
Wendy,"Look, maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together, an-and that way we could-
"
Kyle,"NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
"
Cartman,"Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
"
Kyle,"What's the matter dude?
"
Cartman,"I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
"
Kyle,"You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"Really?
"
Kyle,"Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
"
Riley,"Wow. What is that?
"
Kyle,"Seriously, Cartman. You could make money with these!
"
Cartman,"Gee, thanks Kyle!
"
Researcher,"The truth is we still know very little about Asperger's syndrome, Mrs. Marsh. All our patients here show the same social awkwardness that your son exhibits.  Good morning Mr. Mathers.
"
Mr. Mathers,"Goodbye, doctor 
"
Researcher,"It's as if they all have an inability to distinguish from what is socially acceptable and what is not.  We've got a new patient, Martin. I want you to meet Stan.
"
Martin,"Nice to meet you.
"
Researcher,"Here at the treatment center, our focus is on awareness.  Asperger's is serious, but unfortunately because of its name people think it's a disease to be made fun of.  Alright everyone, let's have a seat.  Oh uh, we'll be done at about 5 pm, Mrs. Marsh. I'll call if it's any earlier.
"
Sharon,"Oh, right, uh. Good bye, Stan. I-I love you. 
"
Researcher,"Alright, are we clear?
"
Neo,"We're clear! 
"
Morpheus,"Watch that window, Puck!  Everyone, make sure this room isn't bugged!  Alright Stan, listen up! We don't have a lot of time! You've been told Asperger's is real! It isn't! It's just a front we use to stay hidden!
"
Stan,"Wait, it's not a real illness?
"
Morpheus,"Of course not! If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it Asperger's! That's just, that's just mean!  There's a big war going on out there, Stan, and we want you to join our fight to bring it all down!
"
Stan,"Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!
"
Morpheus,"You've broken through their reality and they don't like it! Others deserve to know the truth! You see everything as shit, don't you?!  Where other people see fun movies and hear cool music, all you see and hear is shit! Am I right?
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Neo,"So do we. All of us here. We know the truth too.
"
Morpheus,"We found a way to make it stop, Stan. Now are you interested? Or not?
"
Cartman,"Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
"
Clyde,"I just can't believe how yummy these are.
"
Cartman,"There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
"
Molly,"Thanks!
"
Cartman,"How are we doing on those patties, Jew?
"
Kyle,"About three minutes, fatass!
"
Cartman,"Nice!
"
Butters,"Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
"
Cartman,"It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
"
Kyle,"Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
"
Cartman,"I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 
"
Morpheus,"Alright, is he ready to be sent in?
"
Bald Guy,"He's ready! Beta levels are normal.
"
Stan,"Who are you people?
"
Morpheus,"We are the Secret Society of Cynics.  Everything looks like shit to you, right? What if I were to tell you... that you're seeing the world the way it actually is?
"
Stan,"Huh?
"
Morpheus,"The world around us has all completely turned to shit. But aliens are putting out a brainwave that keeps most people seeing a false reality
"
Stan,"Aliens?
"
Morpheus,"Or, robots from the future, whatever. The point is they need to keep everyone in a blissful state of ignorance.
"
Neo 2,"Yeah. Everything used to be awesome and cool, but now everything's gone to shit and nobody knows except us!
"
Neo,"Yeah!
"
Stan,"Because of aliens? 
"
Morpheus,"Or genetically altered humans, whatever, fuck you! All that matters is that you are the key to bringing this whole thing down. They know who we are, but they won't be expecting you! Are you ready to go back into the illusionary world you once lived in?
"
Stan,"Yeah I'm ready!
"
Morpheus,"Let's send him in!  Drink this. 
"
Stan,"Ahhhh!  Oh coool!
"
Adam Sandler,"Jill, you got a date with Al Pacino?
"
Jill,"I think Al Pacino wants to play Twister with your sister.
"
Stan,"Adam Sandler's funny.
"
Butters,"Hey Kyle, you have a visitor. 
"
Kyle,"Stan? 
"
Stan,"Kyle! 
"
Kyle,"Hey, Stan!
"
Stan,"Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
"
Kyle,"Stan, are you alright?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
"
Kyle,"Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. 
"
Stan,"But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
"
Kyle,"Dude. Have you been drinking?
"
Stan,"You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
"
Kyle,"It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
"
Stan,"...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
"
Kyle,"See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
"
Cartman,"Everything alright here, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, it's fine.
"
Cartman,"We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
"
Kyle,"Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.
"
Stan,"Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
"
Kyle,"Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
"
Stan,"Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 
"
Big Harry,"Big Harry and Mike in the Morning and in case you didn't catch last night's episode of , we're breakin' it down.
"
Mike,"Oh Big Harry, when the  ran into the - 
"
Big Harry,"Nonono, no! How about when .
"
Morpheus,"He's back!  Did you see the illusionary world again?
"
Neo,"How does it feel to be back in the Matrix?
"
Stan,"I feel like total shit.
"
Bald Guy,"It's okay. That's just your brain levels adjusting back to the real world.
"
Morpheus,"Try and focus, Stan: we've found them! We know where the rock creatures are now.
"
Stan,"The rock creatures?
"
Morpheus,"Or aliens, or AI- things. Whatever, fuck you.
"
Stan,"Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
"
Neo,"He's gonna pop! 
"
Morpheus,"Come on kid, there's not a lot of time left.
"
Neo,"You're pushin' him too hard!
"
Stan,"Ugh God.
"
Morpheus,"Stan, you have to convince people they're living in a world of illusion. We're sending you back in! 
"
Figure 1,"We all know why we are here. There's a rebellion in our midst and it must be SQUASHED OUT!  We have to put an end, to Cartman Burgers. 
"
Other Execs,"Yes, yes, but what do we do?
"
KFC Exec,"At KFC we've seen a 50% drop in sales.
"
Pizza Hut Exec,"It's worse at Pizza Hut. Cartman Burgers choked out the market.
"
McDonald's Exec,"What makes them so good? For whatever reason, these Cartman Burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants!
"
Taco Bell Exec,"There lies the secret.  It's the chemical compounds from all our flavors. Pizza Hut, Burger King, KFC, all somehow infused into one burger.
"
KFC Exec,"It's as if he's somehow taking all the ingredients of our food, breaking them down into some kind of... gas. And them somehow... infusing that gas into his hamburger. What kind of instrument could he be using to do this?
"
Pizza Hut Exec,"It would have to be some sort of super Dutch oven.
"
Burger King Exec,"But a Dutch oven with greater technology than we've ever seen. 
"
Stan,"Aughah. 
"
McDonald's Exec,"Hey! Wake up. Come on now, wake up!  Use the smelling salts! 
"
Stan,"...Enchirito?
"
McDonald's Exec,"You know the secret?
"
Stan,"What? You guys are aliens?
"
McDonald's Exec,"Stop playing with us! What's the secret behind Cartman Burger's amazing taste?!
"
Stan,"Dude, I don't know!
"
Taco Bell Exec,"He's lying!  You see this kid in the picture? This guy is his best friend.
"
McDonald's Exec,"Ah ha!
"
Stan,"I'm not friends with him.
"
Taco Bell Exec,"They've been through everything together. Inseparable.
"
Stan,"No, no, we don't hang out anymore.
"
McDonald's Exec,"Oho right, like someone would just walk away from a friendship like that?
"
Stan,"Dude, I didn't walk away! I turned 10 and everything he wanted to do seemed shitty to me, so I-!
"
McDonald's Exec,"Oh sure! Anyone would ditch out on their best friend 'cause they weren't feeling good! Now stop playing games and tell us why Cartman Burgers is so delicious!
"
Stan,"I don't know!
"
McDonald's Exec,"Alright, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.
"
Kyle,"There, ten mediums and five medium-rares.
"
Cartman,"Alright, I'll take these to the flavor enhancer.
"
Kyle,"Next please.  Oh, hey.
"
Stan,"Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
"
Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
Stan,"How do you guys make them so yummy?
"
Kyle,"I don't know.
"
McDonald's Exec,"You'd BETTER get him to tell you or you're getting shot in the back of the head!  You got that?!
"
Stan,"Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
"
Kyle,"Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
"
Stan,"No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
"
Kyle,"Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
"
McDonald's Exec,"Oh, right. Like a friend would walk out on somebody who was diagnosed with a serious illness!
"
Stan,"Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
"
Kyle,"You said ""fuck you"" to my face, Stan.
"
Stan,"Dude, I didn't realize what I was saying.
"
McDonald's Exec,"Oh yeah, like any friend would say something that severe and then try to take it back.
"
Kyle,"Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
"
McDonald's Exec,"Goddamnit this is getting us nowhere!  Everyone get back! Do you wanna play hardball?! That's fine!  All right, let's see this mighty machine once and for all! 
"
Morpheus,"You vampire sons of bitches! 
"
Neo,"Haha! 
"
Morpheus,"Alright, nice work Stan. Now comes the final step! You have to take out Duck President!
"
Stan,"Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
"
Mr. Mathers,"Uh oh, looks like the serum is wearing off!  Here, you'd better take some more! 
"
Stan,"No, I'm done with that! 
"
Morpheus,"But Stan, you have to take down the bad guys and go through a personal transformation, so that everything can go back to the way it was!
"
Stan,"I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
"
Douglas,"Wow. 
"
Stan,"Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
"
Randy,"Stan? Stan! Get in the car, Stan! Your mom and I are movin' back in together!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Randy,"We worked it out, pal. Surprise!
"
Stan,"No, dad, no. No, please!
"
Sharon,"We talked a lot and, we know it's what's best for you kids and, I don't know...
"
Stan,"No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
"
Sharon,"People get older, Stanley. And as you get older you realize... the best thing to do is just... stick with what you know.
"
Kyle,"You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
"
Crowd,"Eeewww!
"
Big Harry,"I like that!
"
Mike,"Yeah.
"
Big Harry,"Big Harry and Mike in the Morning, talkin' about Two and a Half Men. I think Ashton Kutcher makes it the show to be seen, Mike.
"
Mike,"Yeah, but what about that movie Dolphin Tale? I am psyched for that!
"
Big Harry,"Dolphin Tale, Big Harry and Mike in the Morning.  Let's hear one from the band Slamjammer and their song- 
"
Kyle,"Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
"
Cartman,"The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! 
"
Stan,"...K, coming. 
"
Cartman,"Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
"
Liane,"Eric, you wanna say hi to Grandpa?
"
Cartman,"Not now, Mom! We're playing Texans versus Mexicans! Gah!  All right patrol, you all know the drill. Not one Mexican is to get past this border! Not a single one! Yeehaw!
"
The other four,"Yeehaw! 
"
Butters,"Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
"
Stan,"Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
"
Butters,"Oh what, I'm not a good Meheecan?
"
Stan,"You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
"
Kyle,"Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
"
Cartman,"Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
"
Kyle,"Hey Texans! Let me through; we want a treaty!
"
Cartman,"He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
"
Kyle,"Better than being a fatass Texan!
"
Cartman,"Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
"
Kyle,"No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!
"
Stan,"Base! 
"
Cartman,"Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
"
Clyde,"I was enthralled with the dialog exchange.
"
Cartman,"Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
"
Token,"Base!
"
Cartman,"Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
"
Craig,"I didn't hear him coming with all your screaming.
"
Cartman,"Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
"
Jimmy,"Eh, b-base.
"
Cartman,"Oh God! 
"
Stan,"So, so then, so then the pope says, ""Maybe you should go check the toilet."" 
"
Craig,"Hey. Hey, I got one.  Why do girls wear makeup and perfume?
"
Token,"Why?
"
Craig,"'Cause they're ugly and they stink. 
"
Stan,"Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
"
Cartman,"I'm not pouting! I just heard all these jokes before!
"
Kyle,"So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
"
Cartman,"At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 
"
Butters,"Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: ""Go that way."" How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
"
Butters,"Hello? Anybody? Come on Mantequilla, you have to find that border!  Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. Lalala, lalala, Work Mexican Work. 
"
Woman,"Oh, careful darling, the storm is getting worse.
"
Man,"It sure is. I-I can barely see. 
"
Woman,"Oh my God look out it's a Mexican! 
"
Man,"Oh my God, are you alright?
"
Butters,"Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
"
Man,"Poor thing must have snuck across the border and then lost track of his family.
"
Butters,"I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
"
Woman,"Guest room. Guest room. Bed, bed. Pillow. You're going to be okay.  Do you understand?
"
Man,"Darling, I don't know if we can keep him.
"
Woman,"What are we supposed to do?! Call the police?! And have him shipped back to Mexico like some animal?!  Window. Window.
"
Man,"Yep, window.
"
Woman,"Bueno!  He'll have so much more opportunity here than he ever would in Mexico!  Window. Window.  Windex. Windex, Mantequilla. Paper towel.  Sí, sí Mantequilla 
"
Man,"Ah, be sure to get the edges.
"
Woman,"Oh darling, it's wonderful.
"
Cartman,"No. NO! Must protect the border! Everyone's gettin through! No! Clyde! We're losing! Kyle go through! Oh no, now Stan's through! And Jimmy! It's over! The only Mexican left is Butters; we've got...  Butters!  Hey! Wake up you guys! Wake up, losers!
"
Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
Cartman,"Where is Butters?
"
Kyle,"He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
"
Stan,"Yeah, I think he was. Wait.
"
Craig,"Butters is one of those people who you can never remember if he was there or not.
"
Kyle,"Butters?
"
Stan,"Butters!
"
Kyle,"Jesus, it's freezing out here. He, he could be dead.
"
Cartman,"All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
"
Craig,"Game on!
"
Kyle,"Wugh, game on. 
"
Butters,"Work, Mexican, Work.  Work, Mexican, Work
"
Woman,"Mantequiila? Mantequilla, come to the living room. We have a surprise for you. 
"
Man,"Surprise! We've scraped some money together and got you something. 
"
Woman,"It's a present, Mantequilla. Un presente.
"
Butters,"Wow! A present just for me? 
"
Woman,"Oh he's such a happy little Mexican. 
"
Man,"How do you like that, Mantequilla? Your very own leaf blower! Hahah, I have no idea how it works, but I'm sure you do, huh. Say, how would you like to go in the back yard and play? 
"
Woman,"Oh look at him, darling. He's so happy.
"
Man,"Hup. Nono, Mantequilla! You're just blowing the leaves from one side to the other. Get them in one pile so you can use the garbage bags we loaned you.
"
Butters,"Ah, sí señor.
"
Woman,"Oh he's so adorable.
"
Singers,"Work, Mexican, work.
"
Butters,"All week long, bossman say
"
Both,"Work, Mexican, work.
"
Butters,"Sing your Song, earn your pay
"
Both,"Work, Mexican, work.Work, Meheecan
"
Singers,"Sweat
"
Butters,"Meheecan
"
Singers,"Toil
"
Butters,"Meheecan, it's your
"
Both,"lot in life.
"
Butters,"While people play in the sun all day
"
Both,"Work, Mexican, work.
"
Man,"Honey? Honey, what's wrong? 
"
Woman,"It's Mantequilla. We've tried giving him everything, but I don't think he's happy. Tonight I told him he could do whatever he wanted before bed - wash the dishes, mop up our bathroom - but you know what he said? He said ""I need to go home."" I tried telling him ""your home is here, Mantequilla! ¡Tu casa es aquí!"" But I don't think he feels it.
"
Man,"Well, maybe if we let him paint the garage, he'll feel more like family and then-
"
Woman,"No, Brian! In my heart I know it's true. He belongs with his own kind, Brian. He belongs with his own kind!
"
Brian,"Come on, honey. 
"
Butters,"Hey, where are you going?
"
Woman,"No! Mantequilla bad! Go now!
"
Butters,"Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
"
Woman,"No es bueno, Mantequilla! ¡No me mi-mires! ¡Por favor! ¡Por favor no mires! 
"
Butters,"So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
"
Worker 1,"Mantequilla?
"
Worker 2,"Mantequilla?
"
Worker 1,"¡Yo he escuchado de este niño! ¡He visto anuncios de el por donde quiera! 
"
Worker 3,"Sí. Es famoso! 
"
Butters,"Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
"
Worker 1,"¿Un niño gringo que quiere ses mexicano? 
"
Worker 3,"Ay, tiempos han cambiado. 
"
Worker 1,"No... no. ¿Saben qué? Mantequilla tiene derecho. ¿Por qué venimos a este país? ¡Vale madre aquí, 'mano! 
"
Butters,"Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
"
Worker 1,"Debemos escuchar a este niño. ¡Mexico es mucho mejor que esto! 
"
Butters,"All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
"
Worker 1,"Todos mis amigos están allí también.. 
"
Worker 2,"¡A la chingada con esto! ¡Vamonos! 
"
Worker 3,"Sí, ¡vamonos a la chingada!
"
Butters,"Viva la Meheeco!
"
Doctor,"Alright, let's get him into ER.
"
Elderly Man,"Careful w'my foot! 
"
Worker 2,"¡Oye Yimenez! ¡Nos vamos a regresar, hombre! 
"
Yimenez,"¿Qué? 
"
Worker 2,"¡Este lugar es una mierda! ¡Nos regresamos a Mexico!
"
Butters,"We're crossin' the border!
"
Yimenez,"¡Jose! ¡Martinez! Nos vamos para atras para Mexico! 
"
Butters,"Olé!
"
Border Officer 1,"Pretty quiet out there.
"
Border Officer 2,"Yeah, a bit too quiet if you ask me. Gimme those! 
"
Border Officer 1,"Just seems like Mexicans don't try to cross into the US as much as they used to, you know?
"
Border Officer 2,"Noo, they're out there, Charlie. Plottin' their next move. They'll do anything they can to get into the Land of Opportunity.  And as long as this country offers everyone a better life, there's gonna be people calmorin' to get it. It's the curse of success, Charlie.  A great and wealthy nation will always be plagued  by the needy tryin' to-what the hell? 
"
Charlie,"Uhh, sir? Aren't those Mexicans runnin' into Mexico?
"
Border Officer 2,"That don't make sense.
"
Charlie,"You're goin' the wrong way!
"
Anchorman,"You've heard of Mexican salsa, but Mexican pride? The phenomenon is called ""Orgullo de Mantequilla,"" where Mexicans are realizing it actually is starting to suck more here in the US. The borders are being flooded with Latin Americans trying to get back to their own countries. 
"
Randy,"Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!
"
Anchorman,"But just what has sparked the Mexican desire to live... in Mexico? Joining us now is economist Mark Geiger, and Mark, we've heard of Mexican ice cream, but Mexican patriotism?
"
Mr. Geiger,"Yes, it's a very odd phenomenon, Chris. Ih it just- 
"
Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell is this?! 
"
Cartman,"You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
"
Kyle,"""Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol""?! ""Permission to shoot on sight""?!
"
Cartman,"You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
"
Kyle,"Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
"
Cartman,"Well then I inadvertently won the game, didn't I?
"
Chris,"Do you have what it takes to join the Border Patrol? Border Patrol officers are looking for volunteers to help with the reverse immigration crisis.
"
Cartman,"Oh dude. Sweet.
"
Crowd,"¡Vamos Mantequilla!  ¡Vamos Mantequilla!  ¡Vamos Mantequilla! 
"
Butters,"Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really-
"
Crowd,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  ¡Oy!  ¡Oy!  ¡Orgullo!  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. 
"
Butters,"Wow.
"
Border Officer 2,"Welcome to the US Border Patrol. You volunteers are the key to keepin' this country safe and prosperous.  Every day, more and more Mexicans are tryin' to get past this fence and go back to their homes in Mexico. As border patrol officers our duty is to stop Mexicans from crossin' the border. We don't need to worry about the semantics of which direction they're going, we're just supposed to stop them!  Marcus?
"
Marcus,"The standard-issue border patrol weapon is the P-29 stun baton. It carries a 4000 watt charge and is your best option for enforcin' border patrol law.
"
Cartman,"This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
"
Marcus,"The baton is non-lethal, but powerful e-
"
Border Officer 3,"Hey! We got some! Mexicans at 2 o'clock! 
"
Border Officer 2,"Let's get ready, recruits! Must be a couple dozen of them!  This is the US Border Patrol! Stop where you are! Turn around and get back to work!
"
Marcus,"There's too many of 'em! We're gonna need backup! 
"
Border Officer 2,"You're pretty good at stoppin' Mexicans, son. What's your name?
"
Cartman,"Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
"
Narrator,"Dedicated. Patriotic. Tireless. These are the men and women of the US Border Patrol. They work around the clock protecting American prosperity. They are the front line in making sure Mexicans stay here and work. The border patrol is uncompromising, diligent, and cool. They will defend, arrest, and most importantly, let the Mexicans know that they are way better off here in the United States.
"
President Calderón,"¡Hoy celebramos el primer día de Mantequilla, honrando el espiritu de México! 
"
Butters,"Thanks everyone.  It suer has been great gettin' to know you all. You've been really great amigos.  It's really kind of made me... appreciate my amigos back home. I know they were waitin' for me, and I'm sure they're all worried sick.
"
President Calderón,"Mantequilla, tu tienes que hacer una decisión. Los Estados Unidos están de baja, y claro, México pronto será el mejor lugar. Pero como Mexicanos, nosotros sabemos que nada es más importante que la famlia, y amistades. Estás invitado a vivir con nosotros, Mantequilla, pero tienes que seguir tu corazón. ¿Quieres quedarte aquí con nosotros, o quieres estar con tus amigos? 
"
Butters,"...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
"
Cartman,"No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.
"
Border Officer 4,"Let's face it: they've just about all gotten back across. No matter how hard we tried, the Mexicans all got across the border.
"
Border Officer 2,"When we asked Obama to stop illegal immigrants, we didn't mean to make the US so shitty they wouldn't wanna come anymore.
"
Marcus,"Hey! Hey wait a minute!  It's a Mexican!  I think he wants to come back in! 
"
Border Officer 2,"Oh my God it is!  Hey! Hey! Come on in!  Come on! Come on! Come on, it's okay!  What the fuck are you doing?! Get that gate open! 
"
Border Officer 5,"Come on, buddy!
"
Other Officers,"Come on now, come on! You've got it. 
"
Cartman,"Wait a minute, isn't that...
"
Butters,"Game on!
"
Cartman,"Oh no you don't! 
"
Butters,"AAAH!
"
Border Officer 2,"What the fuck are you doin'?!
"
Cartman,"That asshole is not getting across my border! 
"
Butters,"AAAAH!  I'll get over! 
"
Cartman,"No you won't Butters!
"
Butters,"Giddy up! 
"
Commentator,"Un otro shoto de Mantequilla. Y Manteque-ah. ¡Oh! ¡Una arma! Una arma del El Niño Gordo! 
"
Mexicans,"Ohhh!
"
Cartman,"Ey!
"
Commentator,"Mantequilla ayudar ¡1a Border Patrol! 
"
Cartman,"¡Respeto mi autóridad! 
"
Commentator,"Border Patrol pegaron ¡El Zero Gordo! 
"
Cartman,"Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
"
Butters,"Haha! Heheeheeheehahaheehee!
"
Cartman,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
"
Butters,"Base! 
"
Mexicans,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
Commentator,"El mirito, vinto! 
"
Butters,"So then, so then the fireman says ""That won't even fit in my scrotum!""  Yeah!
"
Kyle,"Stop being a pouty little bitch 'cause you lost, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
"
Butters,"Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
"
Stan,"Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 
"
Mexicans,"¡Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...  ¡Oy! ¡Oy!  ¡Orgullo!  ¡Maaantequilla! 
"
Cartman,"A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
"
Cartman,"YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
"
Stan,"What?
"
Cartman,"You guys, you know Pete Melman?  Fourth Grade, Mr. Bart's class?
"
Kyle,"The blond kid?
"
Cartman,"Yeah yeah, Pete Melman!
"
Stan,"What about him?
"
Cartman,"He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
"
Kyle,"How do you know?!
"
Cartman,"Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
"
Butters,"Eavesdropper?
"
Kyle,"What's that?
"
Cartman,"Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 
"
Clyde,"Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper? Pete Melman shit his pants! 
"
Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.
"
Nurse Bronski,"Hello Mrs. Melman, this is the school nurse. I'm afraid your son has had a little accident. 
"
Mrs. Melman,"Oh no, what is it? Is he okay?
"
Stan,"Turn it up. 
"
Nurse Bronski,"No no, it's not serious, but he went number two during class.  I'm afraid he's gonna need a new pair of pants and underwear, and a clean pair of socks.
"
Craig,"Hey, did you guys see Eavesdropper?
"
Cartman,"Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 
"
Kyle,"Dude, that's so wrong!
"
Butters,"Hey! Pete Melmman pooped his pants and uh had to have his mom bring him new undies!
"
Cartman,"Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman.""
"
Mr. Mackey,"Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.
"
Cartman,"Oh Jesus, what now?! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric, as you might have heard, a student here in South Park Elementary had an accident in the classroom.
"
Cartman,"Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 
"
Principal Victoria,"Oookay, but you probably understand that for Pete, it isn't that funny. For him it's embarrassing and terrifying.
"
Cartman,"Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric, it has been almost one year since Corey Duran defecated in his pants here in school. Now, you remember what happened to him?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, he killed himself.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Yes, and the reason he killed himself, Eric, was that the ridicule and the torment from other students,  spearheaded by you, cause him-!
"
Cartman,"Hey! Whoooa.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
"
Cartman,"'Kay, whoa, whoa! We've been through this, you cannot put Corey Duran's death on me! I'm not the one who crapped him pants in front of everyone!
"
Mr. Adler,"Eric, we are asking you to please just remember what happened to Corey and not let it happen to Pete.
"
Principal Victoria,"Please just let it go.
"
Cartman,"You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
"
Mr. Mackey,"We are hoping that if you don't fan the flames, Eric, the other students might forget might forget about it!
"
Cartman,"Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
"
Principal Victoria,"Alright Eric, here's the deal: This school cannot have another suicide on its hands. We want you to see Pete Melman through this, and turn public opinion around.
"
Cartman,"Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
"
Principal Victoria,"If Pete Melman does not kill himself,  we will make it very worth your while.
"
Cartman,"You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?
"
Stan,"No way.
"
Kyle,"What's up?
"
Stan,"The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
"
Kyle,"Dude, that's fucked up.
"
Stan,"Come on dude, it's pretty funny.
"
Kyle,"It's funny that something that should be completely private is put up on a Web site for everyone to see??
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.
"
Butters,"It's megasuperhilarious! 
"
Cartman,"Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
"
Jenny,"What do you want?!
"
Cartman,"Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
"
Jenny,"Yeah, it's gross! 
"
Cartman,"So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
"
Jenny,"So what?
"
Cartman,"I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.
"
Jenny,"I don't like you!
"
Cartman,"I know. Ah I know you don't like me back. I ju- Yeah, you know, the- this was stupid, I'm sorry. Will you just take a cupcake?  Oh, don't take the cupc- I, I'm sorry. I, I'm sorry I wasted your time. 
"
Jenny,"Hey. Wait.  Look, I'm sorry. That was mean. I'd love to try one of your mom's cupcakes.
"
Mr. Garrison,"And now number 17 many of you got wrong as well. The correct answer was D, whales are mammals. 
"
Jenny,"Oh! Gahhh. Ohf.
"
Mr. Garrison,"They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
"
Cartman,"You okay, Jenny?
"
Jenny,"Yeah, I'm fine, I just- Awwgh!  M-Mr. Garrison? Can I please  be excused?
"
Cartman,"Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"What's the matter?
"
Jenny,"Gah I just need to go to the restroom!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Well okay.
"
Cartman,"Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
"
Jenny,"Please! I've gotta go now!
"
Cartman,"Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
"
Jenny,"No, Mr. Garrison, I've gotta- go- AAAH! 
"
Class,"Eeeeww! 
"
Cartman,"Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
"
Kids,"Ew!
"
Butters,"Sick!
"
Cartman,"WAY worse!
"
Timmy,"Run. 
"
Principal Victoria,"...The Doctors say that Jenny Simon barely survived the fall. Jumping off the school roof fractured her pelvis.
"
Cartman,"Alright, kewl.
"
Mr. Mackey,"No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!
"
Cartman,"You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
"
Principal Victoria,"That's wasn't the point, Eric! Nobody was supposed to kill themselves! Unless you fix this our deal is off!
"
Cartman,"Mobody can be made fun of for crapping their pants, and nobody can die!
"
The three adults,"Yes!
"
Cartman,"Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Our students did average, maybe just below average.
"
Cartman,"Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
"
Principal Victoria,"That's insane!
"
Cartman,"Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.
"
Stan,"Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her ""soft-serve Simon.""
"
Kyle,"That's not funny.
"
Craig,"Hey, here's a post about Token: ""Token Black's Private Gym Photos"" 
"
Kyle,"I'm not looking at that!
"
Stan,"Come on, dude, it's pretty funny!
"
Kyle,"It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
"
Stan,"I wouldn't care.
"
Craig,"Exclusive: Stan Marsh thinks Elise Thompson has a hot butt crack.
"
Stan,"What?
"
Craig,"""In an email sent yesterday to KENNY McCormick, Stan Marsh wrote 'Dude, you should have been in PE today. Elise Thompson's butt crack was totally showing.' He went on to call her butt crack quote 'nice' and that the whole experience was quote 'pretty awesome'.""
"
Stan,"Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!
"
Kenny,"(What?)
"
Stan,"How did Eavesdropper get a hold of my e-mail to you?!
"
Kenny,"(I don't know.)
"
Stan,"Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
"
Kenny,"(No!)
"
Stan,"That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.
"
Wendy,"You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!
"
Kenny,"(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!) 
"
Stan,"No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
"
Wendy,"Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! 
"
Stan,"Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
"
Wendy,"So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! 
"
Stan,"This is an issue of trust and privacy! We have to all work together to put an end to Eavesdropper once and for all!  Yes, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
"
Stan,"Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
"
Wendy,"Specially when they're writing about your boyfriend's addiction to crack. 
"
Stan,"Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!
"
Craig,"It's not somebody in this room.
"
Stan,"What? How do you know?
"
Craig,"Because whoever it is just now posted a new story on Eavesdropper: ""Allison Taft reveals embarrassing secret about Craig Tucker.""  Yeah. Hey wait, that's me.
"
Kyle,"Where is it coming from?
"
Craig,"Huh?
"
Kyle,"If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
"
Stan,"We only have music class on Thursday.
"
Wendy,"Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
"
Kyle,"Get ready guys. Whoever is in here is the kid that's hacking our e-mails and phone calls! You guys ready?!
"
Stan,"Oh I'm ready!
"
Kyle,"One.  Two. Three! 
"
Craig,"It's a rat! 
"
Kyle,"Get it! 
"
Stan,"Don't let him get away!
"
Token,"He's gone!
"
Stan,"What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
"
Kyle,"Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
"
Frog King,"Lemmiwinks! I come with news of great gravity. Another rodent is out there, spreading terrible rumors and hacking e-mails.  Yes. And I'm afraid the news is worse. The creature doing this, Lemmiwinks, is your brother, Wikileaks!
"
Singer,"''Wikileaks, the bum hacker with a heart of doom.Everyone knows the gerbil king, but no one ever speaksOf Lemminwinks's brother, the evil Likiweaks...
"
Frog King,"Once again Wikileaks is trying to wreak havoc on our world. Only you can stop him, Lemmiweaks.
"
Singer,"Lemmiwinks, King of Gerbils, stop your brother of doom!
"
Girl 1,"It's just so embarrassing. What if the other girls find out my mother is in rehab?
"
Girl 2,"It's okay Emily. Can I tell you a secret? My mom has a drinking problem too. 
"
Emily,"Really? You too?
"
Girl 2,"That's just between us, okay?
"
Emily,"Of course, Tammy. I'm really glad I shared this with you. 
"
Stan,"Stop that rat! 
"
Stan,"Knock it off! 
"
Boy 1,"I just want you to know that I have a hure crush on you and-  HEY! 
"
Butters,"NO Wikileaks! Bad!
"
Cartman,"Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eh, Is this one good?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I think they're all ready.
"
Principal Victoria,"You sure this will work, Eric? What if some of the students don't eat the pizza?
"
Cartman,"It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
"
Cartman,"Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler. 
"
Cartman,"Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 
"
Selena Gomez,"Hi Eric. I understand you really wanted to meet me. Wanna get a picture together?
"
Cartman,"No thanks. Okay, proceed.
"
Mr. Mackey,"I/m sorry about this, Ms. Gomez.  Alright, get her the fuck out of here. 
"
Principal Victoria,"Okay, Eric, you got what you wanted. Are we straight?
"
Cartman,"That. Was. Amazing.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here!  What the?  Oh shit!  Stop that rat!
"
Frog King,"Alright Lemmiwinks, we should probably get going now... The time is nigh, Lemmiwinks. Let us chase your destiny.  Ah! Sparrow Prince! What news do you bring?
"
Sparrow Prince,"Wikileaks grows stronger with each passing moment.  The birds are tweeting that he is about to release his biggest story yet.
"
Frog King,"Then the moment is truly here! Come Lemmiwinks! Let us make haste! Le-le-Lemmiwinks? His heart is so heavy. I weep for him.
"
Sparrow Prince,"Indeed. Could you do it, Frog Prince? Could you kill your own brother?
"
Frog King,"I thank God I don't have to make that decision.  We might need to bring in some outside help.
"
Stan,"You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
"
Butters,"Biggest story about who?
"
Craig,"There's no telling. It could be about any of us. 
"
Catatafish,"Well met, children of Adam. I, am Catatafish.
"
Singers,"Catatafish of the Salmon School.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Catatafish,"I come asking for your help. There is only one thing that can stop Wikileaks. But right now Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner.
"
Stan,"Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
"
Kyle,"What is that thing?
"
Catatafish,"I am Catatafish. I am a great wizard and, I am a friend. And I'm a ghost, besides of course being a fish.
"
Singers,"Catatafish's tale will soon be told.
"
Stan,"Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
"
Catatafish,"He does it purely for reasons of evil. And his treachery is not limited to humans. Wikileaks posted exaggerated things about me, too. He posted on his Web site that I had sex with an underage fish, and that I made her perform bass to mouth. If you accept this quest you will help the Gerbil King defeat Wikileaks once and for all! But the choice is yours. I'm not here to make you do anything. Like that underage salmon. I didn't make her do anything. If she wants to do bass to mouth, how is it my fault?
"
Singers,"Catatafish made a salmon suck asshole.
"
Catatafish,"No! No, see, that's wrong! It's being exaggerated again!
"
Kyle,"Just tell us where Lemmiwinks is being held prisoner so we can kill this stupid rat!
"
Catatafish,"Careful child! I assure you, Wikileaks is anything but stupid, except when he said I made that teenage fish perform ass to trout. That was stupid and untrue. Did I say ass to trout? I meant to say bass to mouth, though I guess it's basically the same thing, not that I did it.
"
Principal Victoria,"Alright, are we sure we're alone?
"
Mr. Mackey,"We're alone, now what the hell are we gonna do?
"
Mr. Adler,"What can we do? We're all gonna get fired!
"
Principal Victoria,"This story hasn't gone up on Eavesdropper yet. Maybe it won't!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh right! ""The School Faculty Tries To Poison All Their Students."" That's not gonna be on Wikileaks!
"
Mr. Adler,"Oh, let's just face it: We made our beds when we enlisted Eric Cartman's help. We have to lie in them.
"
Mr. Mackey,"All we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves! We're not bad!
"
Principal Victoria,"No, no, we're not bad.
"
Mr. Mackey,"We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story.
"
Principal Victoria,"What's a bigger story than all the students being made sick?
"
Mr. Adler,"Our students committing suicide?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Hey that's right. Corey Duran killed himself last year and we're STILL dealing with the fallout. Maybe there is a way out of this. But we're gonna have to throw Eric Cartman under the bus.
"
Mr. Adler,"How do we do that?
"
Mr. Mackey,"We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.
"
Mother,"Yes?
"
Stan,"Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?
"
Mother,"Yes, Vernon's around somewhere.
"
Stan,"Come on, guys! 
"
Catatafish,"Excuse me.
"
Butters,"There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks! 
"
Stan,"Quick, we need something to carry him in!
"
Kyle,"Here's a shoebox! 
"
Vernon,"Hey! What are you doing with my gerbil?!
"
Stan,"We just need to borrow him, kid. 
"
Vernon,"MOOOM! SOME KIDS ARE STEALING MY GERBIL!
"
Stan,"Look dude, we don't have much time. Wikileaks is about to post his biggest scoop ever on Eavesdropper! Lemmiwinks can stop him!
"
Vernon,"MOOOM! 
"
Frog King,"There's no time, children! You must take Lemmiwinks now!
"
Kyle,"Grab him! 
"
Vernon,"MOOOM! 
"
Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
"
Frog King,"Quickly! We must get to the school! 
"
Stan,"Whoa whoa wait, wait! 
"
Singers,"Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
"
Stan,"Can't this thing go any faster?
"
Butters,"Hang on, Lemmiwinks!
"
Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
"
Stan,"Craig, are we still clear?
"
Craig,"Nothing broke on the Web site yet.
"
Frog King,"Faster driver! The final battle is about to begin! 
"
Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
"
Kyle,"What the hell happened?!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh! Oh God! Oh God he killed himself! Eric Cartman killed himself! Did you see that? Oh why would he do it?  Oh wait uh here, here's a suicide note. Mkay.  Dear Guys, I just cannot go on mkay. I'm tired of being FAT, mkay, and I have to end it all. Mkay. -Eric Cartman.
"
Stan,"Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!
"
Sparrow Prince,"Go by car!
"
Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
"
Frog King,"Quickly, while Lemmiwinks still has it in him!
"
Singers,"Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Run, run, the battle's on!
"
Stan,"Stop right there, you little rat!
"
Singers,"Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks! Run, run, the battle's on! Wikileaks and Lemmiwinks. Go Lemmiwinks! Stop Wikileaks!
"
Frog King,"Wikileaks, you have chosen a path of evil and now you shall pay. Sparrow Prince, Catatafish! 
"
Frog King,"Oh dude, he is fucking him up!
"
Butters,"Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! 
"
Frog King,"He did it!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, let's just delete all this tabloid garbage, mkay.
"
Stan,"Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, but you know? I think we all learned an important lesson about laughing at other people's misfortunes.
"
Cartman,"Boy, I say.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.
"
Cartman,"It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay.
"
Cartman,"Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well students, why don't we uh-  Oooh. Oh, gee, uh...
"
Cartman,"Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mackey?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh!  Aaaah! Oh it's bad!  Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH!  OW!
"
Cartman,"I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, can somebody get me some paper towels?? Or maybe a  Ooowww, okay!  Ooohhh, it's bad!
"
Frog King,"Congratulations, Lemmiwinks.
"
Sparrow Prince,"Thanks to you, private lives will stay private.
"
Catatafish,"Yes, we are all free once again to make teenagers do bass to mouth.
"
Frog King,"Just one question Lemmiwinks: How does it feel to have killed your own brother?  Le-Lemmiwinks?  He's devastated.
"
Sparrow Prince,"Yup, he's devastated.
"
Randy,"I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
"
Nelson,"I didn't see the game.
"
Randy,"You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
"
Nelson,"Took the wife down to Denver to see that new musical in town.
"
Randy,"A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 
"
Worker 1,"Good for you, Nelson. Did you get a blowjob afterwards?
"
Nelson,"Sure did.
"
Worker 2,"Niice. 
"
Randy,"What?
"
Worker 1,"I took my girl to see that show last week. Got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards.
"
Nelson,"Forty-five minutes non-stop.
"
Randy,"Nuh uh.
"
Worker 2,"It's true. I'm taking my wife on Saturday bro.
"
Randy,"Noh uh.
"
Nelson,"I'm telling you Randy, put your time in with the musical, and the rewards afterwards are awesome.
"
Randy,"Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
"
Nelson,"Wicked.
"
Randy,"Oh. Wicked.
"
Singers,"...Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe, she was just wicked people
Head to toe...
She wasn't good, to know what goodness is...
"
Randy,"Hey do you uh, do you want some alcohol or somethin', Sharon?
"
Sharon,"Nono, I'm good, thanks.
"
Randy,"Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 
"
Randy,"Can I get a scotch and soda? 
"
Man 1,"Enjoying the show?
"
Randy,"Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
"
Man 1,"No?
"
Randy,"To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
"
Man 1,"Oh, it'll happen, don't worry. Right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages, all she'll be thinking about afterwards is ""blowjob.""
"
Randy,"Subliminal messages?
"
Man 1,"It's a musical thing. Women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they don't even notice it but, there's a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds. Broadway writers call it ""subtext."" Just listen really, really closely.
"
The Wizard,"While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
"
Singers,"Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me
"
Witches,"Now let's try ... defying ................... gravity ...
"
Male,"....... Look at them ... becoming friends ... here in Oz, you love blowjobs.
"
Witches,"And new loves cry ... defying ................... gravity ...
"
Male,"....... Suddenly ... Don't you love free love blowjobs?
"
Sharon,"Oho that was so much fun! All the costumes and the sets were amazing! I really love the songs. That Stephen Schwartz is a genius! I've got them all stuck in my head.  Hey, that was such a treat. How would you like a little treat? 
"
Randy,"Whoa, no way!
"
Stan,"Come on, Larry!  Dude, why does this happen every time?
"
Shelly,"Do something, you stupid vegan!
"
Cartman,"Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
"
Randy,"You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
"
Man 2,"How long was it?
"
Randy,"She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
"
Worker 2,"Nice, bro!
"
Randy,"Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.
"
Stephen,"What was the show about?
"
Randy,"Uh, shit, I don't know, some green chick and a goat or something.
"
Stan,"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 
"
Shelly,"Go! Go! 
"
Randy,"Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
"
Worker 2,"Wicked isn't even the best, bro. You've gotta check out Jersey Boys! It makes women hummer crazy!
"
Randy,"Really??
"
Worker 1,"Nonono, have you see South Pacific? That's a jaw-breaker.
"
Randy,"Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
"
Sharon,"What?? Randy, are you serious??
"
Randy,"I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
"
Sharon,"Oh my God, first you take me to Wicked and now this?
"
Stan,"Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
"
Randy,"Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
"
Shelly,"Not the vegans!
"
Stan,"No. Dad. Please don't do this!
"
Mr. Feegan,"It takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in today's world! You get labeled ""soft"" or ""silly.""  But the truth is there isn't a need to eat animal products. Would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan?
"
Shelly,"Yes.
"
Mr. Feegan,"Cancer, heart disease, drowning, all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket. And if people wanna say us vegans are silly, well they can just laugh all they want, 'cause being vegan is more important than being popular!
"
Shelly,"Maybe you should let your son decide that for himself. 
"
Mr. Feegan,"He does decide for himself! Larry's been a vegan since he was born! 
"
Shelly,"Maybe if Larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldn't get beat up by every kid in school. 
"
Mr. Feegan,"You know that when you think you have the flu, you're actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs? Researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets.
"
Stan,"Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?
"
Country Singer,"Man time! I need some Man Time!
I got the horses fed and the truck locked up, been workin' my fingers to the bone.

Randy,"Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
"
Man 2,"Sounds like a dream, bro.
"
Randy,"It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is ""Wicked"" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
"
Worker 1,"And Wicked moves to Seattle in a couple of weeks.
"
Nelson,"It's gonna be blue balls for all of us.
"
Stephen,"Wish we could live in New York where all the musicals are.
"
Randy,"Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
"
Bob,"Huh?
"
Randy,"Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
"
Lady 1,"O what a glorious Sunday. I know what I'd like to do with my time.
''
Would you like a blowjob?
"
Man 3,"Yes I would like a blowjob 
"
Both,"Nothing beats a blowjob on football Sunday.
"
Lady 1,"Excuse me, I'm the queen of blowjobs.
"
Man 4,"Really? I would love a blowjob.
"
All,"A woman should give blowjobs on football Sunday
"
Lady 1,"I want to be covered in semen on a bed in the Hotel Jerome
A woman is prettiest covered in semen.
"
All,"Give you husband a blowjob when you get home.
"
Man 4,"And what about you, my fair lady? Could I trouble you for a quick Lewinsky?
"
Lady 2,"Oh I don't know, kind sir. Blowjobs seem a little degrading to me.
"
Man 4,"Come now, a blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart.
"
Men,"Now get on your knees and put that heart to work!
"
All,"Blowjobs, give up your blowjobs.
"
Men,"You're guilty at blowjobs, you love giving blowjobs
"
Women,"... Blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs, ...blowjobs
"
Singers,"So what could be better on a football Sunday? What could be better on a football Sunday?
"
Shelly,"What do you want, Larry? 
"
Larry,"Today, I went to 7-11 and I ate a Slim Jim. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. Nobody ever stood up for me before. 
"
Lady 1,"Oh Reginald! How about a hummer at halftime? A Super Bowl suckle from me?
"
Reginald,"A Supwerbowl hummer at halftime from my lovely blowjob queen!
"
Both,"Two people in love it's amazing. Tim Tebow please don't let us down. How about a hummer at halftime-?
"
Representative,"Mr. Randy Marsh?
"
Randy,"And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.
"
Representative,"It is. I represent some of the biggest names in all of Broadway. They wish to speak with you.
"
Randy,"Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!
"
Representative,"Mr. Marsh, this is Andrew Lloyd Webber 
"
Webber,"Helleow.
"
Representative,"Stephen Schwartz
"
Schwartz,"Hey bro.
"
Representative,"Mr. Elton John.  and Stephen Sondheim.
"
Sondheim,"Sup bro?
"
Randy,"Not much, sup with you guys?
"
Sondheim,"No. I mean, ""sup, bro!""
"
Webber,"Sit down, Mr. Marsh, we need to have a talk. 
"
Schwartz,"We got wind of your musical. Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
"
Randy,"Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
"
Elton John,"You're making it too obvious! Women are gonna figure out what we're doin'!
"
Sondheim,"Musicals are about subtext!
"
Randy,"My musical has lots of subtext.
"
Sondheim,"""A blowjob isn't with your mouth, it's with your heart. Now get on your knees and put that heart to work.""
"
Randy,"And then she does. It's a metaphor.
"
Schwartz,"Bro! What's metaphorical about a musical called ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen""?!
"
Webber,"Tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form. You have to leave it to the professionals!
"
Randy,"Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
"
Sondheim,"You're gonna ruin everything, you idiot!
"
Randy,"Sorry if my work isn't up to your standards!  And now I need to get back to rehearsals.  Oh. And if ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" wins the Tony, don't expect to be invited to my after party. 
"
Shelly,"What do you want, Larry? 
"
Larry,"You make me come out of my shell, Shelly.
You give me strength where there was only fear
I ate at a Burger King today, Shelly
And stood up to a boy who called me ""queer""
When you pushed me off the diving board I
...fell.
And you make the world a nicer place, Shelly
So I can come out of my... shell.
"
Shelly,"Hey!  Do you wanna play Settlers of Catan on Xbox? 
"
Actors,"Blow--- job--- Queen!
Don't stop giving that blowjob. Even when you're tired, don't stop! Don't stop!
Shaaaaroooon!
"
Worker 2,"Randy! Randy, brah!
"
Randy,"Uh, and hold.  Sorry folks, we're in a hold.  What is it now?
"
Worker 2,"Stephen Sondheim is really pissed off, Randy. He says he wants to challenge you to a bro down.
"
Randy,"Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 
"
Worker 2,"Randy, no! Stephen Sondheim is the greatest Broadway composer alive today! Perhaps the greatest of all time! You do NOT want to bro down with him.
"
Randy,"Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
"
Man 2,"Don't bro down against Sondheim, Randy! It's suicide!
"
Randy,"I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 
"
Larry,"Oh no, you built another settlement?
"
Shelly,"And I got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements.
"
Larry,"Oh wow!
"
Mrs. Feegan,"They're having such a great time together. I really wanna thank you, Sharon.
"
Sharon,"No, no, little Larry is really making Shelly come out of her shell too.
"
Mrs. Feegan,"I have to admit it makes me a little nervous having Larry up there without a life preserver on, but I guess we have to take changes sometimes.
"
Sharon,"That's what we're doing, putting our faith in Randy's new musical.
"
Mrs. Feegan,"That's right, I, I hear his musical is getting a lot of attention, that it really has a chance of making it.
"
Sharon,"Oho, more than a chance. Randy's actually having a meeting right now with Stephen Sondheim.
"
Randy,"Whassup brah?!
"
Sondheim,"What brah?!
"
Randy,"Sup brah?!
"
Sondheim,"Take a swing, brah!
"
Randy,"Right here, brah! 
"
Webber,"Let's go, Sondheim! Wipe the street with his punk ass!
"
Randy,"What makes you the brauthority brah?!
"
Sondheim,"West Side Story, brah!
"
Randy,"What brah?!
"
Sondheim,"Sweeney Todd, brah!
"
Randy,"What brah?! What brah?!
"
Sondheim,"Merrily We Rode Along, bro! Why you gotta disrespect, bro?!
"
Randy,"I do respect you, bro!
"
Sondheim,"Show some respect, bro!
"
Randy,"I do respect you, bro!
"
Sondheim,"Then stop disrespectin', bro!
"
Randy,"I respect you, bro!
"
Sondheim,"Okay, I respect you too!
"
Randy,"Okay! 
"
Schwartz,"The bro down is over! Let's bro out!
"
Spectator,"Bro out!
"
Spectator 2,"Party people!
"
Randy,"Oh man, I'm so glad we put our differences aside! That's what bros do!
"
Schwartz,"That's what bros fuckin' do!
"
Sondheim,"You're alright, Marsh. If it's cool with you, bro, Elton and Andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical.
"
Randy,"Hey, really??
"
Elton John,"Yeh. We can help youse out a li'l bit with the subtext. 
"
Webber,"How about instead of ""Splooge-Drenched Blowjob Queen"" we call it... ""The Woman In White""
"
Randy,"Oh, that is beautiful!
"
Bros,"Yeeeeeeeah!
"
Sondheim,"And a cheer to Randy Marsh. Welcome... to Bro'dway.
"
Randy,"Bro'dwaaay!
"
Sondheim,"Wooooooooooo!
"
Webber,"Woohoo!
"
Randy,"Ooof. 
"
Sharon,"Hey hun.
"
Randy,"Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.
"
Sharon,"Ruhur-Randy, it's fine. You do plenty with me. Did you have a good time?
"
Randy,"Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
"
Sharon,"Oho Randy, that's great! I'm really proud of you.
"
Randy,"Aw Sharon, you're the best. I'm not feeling a hundred percent; do you care if I go lay down?
"
Sharon,"Of course not, go ahead, hun.
"
Randy,"Alright babe.
"
Sharon,"I'm just gonna wait up for Shelly.
"
Randy,"Okay. What's Shelly doing?
"
Sharon,"I gave her those tickets to ""Wicked.""  She's seeing it with her little boyfriend.
"
Randy,"She's WHAT?!
"
Sharon,"Yeah, her and little Larry Feegan. They're going to see ""Wicked"" together. It's Shelly's first Broadway musical.
"
Randy,"OH!  Shelly! Hold on! 
"
Sharon,"Randy, slow down! Jesus Christ!
"
Randy,"AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see ""Wicked""?!
"
Sharon,"Why does it matter?!
"
Randy,"She's too young for that stuff!
"
Sharon,"Too young?!
"
Randy,"This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
"
Sharon,"That's it, Randy! Turn this car around right now!
"
Randy,"I can't!
"
Sharon,"WHY?!
"
Randy,"Aww! Alright, look. There's something I should have told you a long time ago, Sharon. Broadway musicals... aren't what you think they are! They're subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs! On the outside it's all singing and dancing, but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex. It's called subtext.
"
Sharon,"That's ridiculous! Musicals don't make me wanna give blowjobs!
"
Randy,"D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw ""Wicked""?
"
Sharon,"Yes. Oh... Well, yeah, but-
"
Randy,"And after ""Lion King"" in New York? ""Godspell""? ""Mamma Mia""?
"
Sharon,"Oh my gosh.
"
Randy,"Broadway shows' sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs! I'm so sorry Sharon.
"
Sharon,"Nuh-nn No, this is crazy! Musical theater people are respected. Refined. Cultured.
"
Randy,"No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
"
Sharon,"It can't be! I've loved Broadway musicals ever since I saw ""Grease"" with Jacob Harrison and his brother Kip and we-  Oh my God!
"
Randy,"AAAA!
"
Sharon,"AAAA!
"
Randy,"Shelly! 
"
Singers,"No one cares about wicked people.
Now she's gone but we don't care.
And are we gonna live in peace, and all live free, you'll see.
O Heaven knows we know what goodness is
O heaven knows wicked people aren't good.
From head to toe-
"
Randy,"Shelly? Shelly?  Shelly, come on. We have to go!
"
Shelly,"Dad, what are you doing here?
"
Randy,"Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
"
Elderly Man,"Would you mind?! I'm trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter!
"
Randy,"Oh you fucking pervert!
"
Usher,"Alright, get the hell out of here, you! 
"
Randy,"Shelly! 
"
Sharon,"Randy!  Randy, what are you doing?!
"
Randy,"It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 
"
The Wizard,"While you'll do great here in the Emerald City, I'm sure you can't wait to go!
"
Singers,"Take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)
Where people like us can all live free (Free to give blowjobs)
Take me away and let's live together
That's the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me
"
Audience,"Ohhhh.
"
Audience Member,"Hey, it's Spider-Man
"
Randy,"Sorry! Sorry.
"
Randy,"Agh! 
"
Announcer,"Sorry folks, we are in a hold. We are in a hold.
"
Audience,"Awwwwww. 
"
Field Reporter,"The musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater.  The only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time. The fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver. 
"
Randy,"Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 
"
Randy,"It's just so... wrong! For men to m- manipulate women like that! I don't care how much singing and dancing there is, a woman's mouth is sacred! Tomorrow I am calling Woman's Day magazine, and exposing the whole conspiracy!  I'm sorry, Sharon. I love you.  I shouldn't have tried to brainwash you. You have every right to be mad.
"
Sharon,"I don't know if I can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in America does.
"
Randy,"Really?
"
Sharon,"Oh Randy,  the bottom line is I love going to those shows. If the fallout from that is I make you really happy for a while, well, I guess they're actually a pretty magical thing.
"
Randy,"Oh Sharon, you're the best. 
"
Sharon,"So, what Broadway show do you think is coming to Denver next?
"
Randy,"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
"
Announcer,"""The Book of Mormon."" You'll get a blowjob.
"
Board Rep,"Last week the students of this school participated in the Presidential Fitness Test. I'm sad to announce that South Park Elementary scored the lowest in health and fitness in the entire country.  On the whole, you students actually scored fine. But the President's Fitness Test is scored on a school-wide average, and one fourth grader at this school scored so low, with a terrifying body fat score, , and high blood pressure and the cholesterol levels of a seventy-year-old man, that it actually brought you entire school's average down to the lowest in the country.  However, the Presidential Fitness Program never wants to single out one child, because then that child might feel bad. And so as far as we're concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs.
"
Principal Victoria,"Ah, could you please use a little different terminology?
"
Board Rep,"Sorry. As far as the board is concerned, you're all a bunch of fat fuckin' pigs. And so it is the recommendation of this board that every week, each class will alternate turns, giving up their recesses and instead reporting to PE.
"
Assembly,"AWWW!
"
Coach,"Alright, fourth grade class, you're up first. We're gonna do some rope-climbin'.
"
Stan,"God this sucks!
"
Kyle,"Four weeks we gotta do this?
"
Cartman,"Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 
"
Coach,"Alright McCormick, let's start with you. Climb the rope. 
"
Cartman,"Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
"
Coach,"Alright, let's go Broflovski. 
"
Cartman,"Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
"
Stan,"Alright Cartman, stop ripping on other people to make yourself less embarrassed about the fact that we're all here because of you!
"
Cartman,"Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
"
Stan,"Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
"
Craig,"Yeah. We're paying for your being fat.
"
Cartman,"Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
"
Wendy,"We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
"
Cartman,"Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
"
Clyde,"Oh grow up.
"
Cartman,"Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
"
Stan,"That's what we mean by ""grow up"" dude! Stop being a baby!
"
Craig,"Yeah, why don't you go home and cry to your stuffed animals again?! 
"
Cartman,"Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
"
Clyde Frog,"But Eric, you are cool.
"
Cartman,"I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
"
Peter Panda,"It's not your fault, Eric. How can they blame you for what is clearly President Obama's fault?
"
Cartman,"What do you mean, Peter Panda?
"
Peter Panda,"You didn't make that stupid Presidential Fitness Test. Obama did.
"
Polly Prissypants,"Yeah, that's right Eric. You don't need to grow up. You are awesome and keeewl.
"
Cartman,"Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
"
Butters,"Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
"
Stan,"Dude, Butters, how many times do we have to go over this? That's not Skeletor, that's a woman named Maria Shriver.
"
Butters,"Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
"
Cartman,"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
"
Butters,"Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
"
Jimmy,"Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.
"
Fifth Grader,"Yeah. The fifth graders agree. We're all being punished for one lazy bitch. Let's make him suffer.
"
Jimmy,"All we need is some good old-fashioned di... di... di... diplomacy.
"
Jimmy,"Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.
"
Board Rep,"Aahh yes, the Fatty Boombalatty class. How's the extra PE treating you?
"
Butters,"Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
"
Board Rep,"What do you want me to do about it?
"
Jimmy,"Well, sir, we believe that the 1% should be dropped from the fitness results, so that our scores can be more accurate.
"
Board Rep,"'Fraid that's impossible. The National Fitness Test has very specific standards. No one child can ever be made to feel singled out. We don't even like to use the term ""physically fit"" anymore because it can make a student feel unphysically fit, and then that student might end up feeling like a total retard.
"
Jimmy,"...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?
"
Board Rep,"A-and then that fourth grader might end up feeling like a total retard.
"
Butters,"Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
"
Jimmy,"All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
"
Cartman,"Mom, have you been here all day?!
"
Liane,"No, sweetie, I've been at the hair salon. Why?
"
Cartman,"Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
"
Liane,"Are you sure, sweetie?
"
Cartman,"Am I sure?? Look at this place!
"
Liane,"But who would want to s-
"
Cartman,"Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!
"
Liane,"What?
"
Cartman,"No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
"
Cartman,"Clyde Frog! Clyde!? Clyde Frog?!  Clyde. CLYDE FROG! 
"
Cartman,"I've known Clyde Frog since I was two years old. He was a fighter, a visionary. But most of all, Clyde Frog was the perfect friend. He never said anything. He never had his own ideas about what he wanted to do. He just sat there goin' along with whatever I wanted. A noble trait that seems lost on you 99%ers.  And now we live in a world where one of you has decided to become a murderer. Well whoever you are, I'm sure you're sitting there right now, in your little green hat, with your left cheek resting against your hand thinking, ""I'm not getting away with this, am I?"" Because whoever you are, maybe you still have one little piece of humanity left, covered up and tainted black by years of Jewish propaganda and left-wing lies. Maybe you should just-
"
Kyle,"Shut the hell up, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Got something to say Kyle?! 
"
Kyle,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
"
Cartman,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?! You tell us, Kyle!  Butbut but but, but uh but let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a biiig investigation to come. And until we prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the killer was, you are all just as guilty as Kyle. Thank you so much. Bagpipes please. 
"
Cartman,"Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
"
Craig,"Where's our five dollars?
"
Cartman,"Fly bu-what?
"
Craig,"It said in the e-mail if we came we each got five dollars.
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
"
Class,"AWWW! 
"
Kid 1,"Come on!
"
Kid 2,"Screw this.
"
Kid 4,"Hurry up, screw this.
"
Cartman,"Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
"
Receptionist,"Sir? Sir, do you remember the kids from that South Park Elementary School?
"
Board Rep,"Oh yes, the Boom Boom Chubby Choom Choom school.
"
Receptionist,"They're all protesting outside, saying our system isn't fair to the 99% of them.
"
Board Rep,"Oh my Jesus! Oh, not a 99% rally.
"
Butters,"I sure hope this works.
"
Field Reporter 1,"Tom, I'm reporting from the middle of a protest where two fourth grade students are fed up, and have decided to occupy Red Robin. Occupy Red Robin has been going on for several hours now, and boys, technically I am part of the 99% so, what do I have to say about all this? 
"
Cartman,"Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
"
Peter Panda,"Why would somebody do such a terrible thing?
"
Polly Prissypants,"Why would somebody hurt Clyde Frog, Eric? Especially because you are so awesome and keewl.
"
Cartman,"I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
"
Rumpertumskin,"Let's stop the charades, Eric, and let's get down to business.
"
Cartman,"What do you mean, Rumpertumskin?
"
Rumpertumskin,"We all know who fuckin' killed Clyde Frog, and she's the same dirty slut who's been fucking with us our whole lives!
"
Liane,"Eric, sweetie, is everything okay?
"
Polly Prissypants,"Does everything look okay?
"
Peter Panda,"Sit down, you fucking bitch.
"
Cartman,"Yes, sit down, mother. We are all having a tea party.
"
Liane,"Uh sweetie, I see that you're a little... disturbed right now, but, maybe you can-
"
Polly Prissypants,"Shut your fat piehole, bitch!
"
Rumpertumskin,"Yeah! You know what you did, skank! You let Clyde Frog get murdered!
"
Liane,"No, Rumpertumskin, I didn't. I swear.
"
Muscleman Marc,"Then why did you write in your diary ""It was probably time for Eric to grow out of his stuffed animals"" anyway?!
"
Cartman,"That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
"
Muscleman Marc,"Well, all I'm saying, Eric, is that-
"
Liane,"Sweetie, you really can just talk to me if you-
"
Muscleman Marc,"ALL I'M SAYING, ERIC, is that you went through your mom's diary for a reason!
"
Liane,"Eric, I promise you, I didn't do anything to your favorite toy. Whoever did this to you, I hate them as much as you do, and I'd do anything to get to the bottom of it.
"
Cartman,"So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
"
Sgt. Yates,"You'd better give me every cop you've got on the South Side! I don't care where ABC parks their truck, as long as it doesn't block the fire trucks!  Jesus, this protest is getting out of hand! Alright, what exactly are we dealing with?
"
Officer 1,"It's no good. The protest has quadrupled in size since this morning. As you can see from this aerial photograph, the protest covers almost two square miles. We have right officers here, here, and here. The media has been contained in this area. 
"
Sgt. Yates,"And where are the actual protesters?
"
Officer 1,"Oh, these two people right here. 
"
Sgt. Yates,"How are we gonna contain this ting?!
"
Officer 2,"I'm afraid it's about to get worse. You see this area here? This is where we're setting up the stage for Bon Jovi.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Bon Jovi?
"
Officer 2,"These are good cops! We can't have them standing around for hours without some entertainment! The problem is, with this area blocked by napping tents, we have no place to serve the officers beer.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Damnit! Don't these protesters know what this is all heading towards?  Full-on class warfare.
"
Cartman,"What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
"
Fireman 1,"The fire started with this. Definitely a case of arson. Somebody hates this kid.
"
Cartman,"Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!  Peter Panda!
"
Peter Panda,"Eh, Eric.
"
Cartman,"Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
"
Peter Panda,"Eric... Remember...  Stay... keeewl. 
"
Fireman 2,"Sorry kid, we need to take this as evidence.
"
Cartman,"Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
"
Female Reporter,"The 99%ers movement continues to grow as more and more Americans occupy Red Robin. I asked some of the people exactly what they hoped to accomplish.  And sir, what do you hope to accomplish by this movement?
"
Patron,"I like the uh, A1 Peppercorn Burger. And they got ummm, bo-bottomless fries.
"
Female Reporter,"And as the protesters inside Red Robin unite together, word is that filmmaker Michael Moore has joined the protesters outside.
"
Michael Moore,"I look at the faces of you protesters and I see the future of America! We are the 99%! YESSS!!
"
Kyle,"Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
"
Fifth Grader,"Maybe we are and maybe we aren't. You got any proof?
"
Stan,"Well, just... you and your friends were the ones saying Cartman needs to suffer?
"
Fifth Grader,"That doesn't prove anything. That fat little fuck is finally getting what's coming to him.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
"
Fifth Grader,"He's in your class but you don't deal with him! So we are gonna remedy the situation! We've got big plans! Just stay out of our way and let the men handle this! 
"
Liane,"Thank you so much for allowing Eric and I to stay here.
"
Bob,"Of course. You can't be staying in a home with that much fire damage.
"
Linda,"To be honest, we're just a little surprised your son begged you to stay with us. We never knew your son and our son were so close.
"
Liane,"I asked little Eric where he would feel safest, and he said with his friend Token.
"
Cartman,"This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
"
Token,"Why are you involving me in this?
"
Cartman,"Token, please. You're the only person I can trust. Because in today's time, black people are somehow incapable of doing something wrong.
"
Field Reporter 2,"Breaking news from the Occupy Red Robin movement. The protesters have decreased in number from two to one, as one of the protesters has apparently splintered off from the group to start a new movement: Occupy the Restroom.
"
Field Reporter 1,"Tom, Occupy the Restroom has been going on for almost thirty minutes now. Certainly a sign that this country is more divided than ever. These 99%ers are fed up,  and as a result you can clearly see this restroom is ""OCCUPIED.""  Uh, Tom, it looks like the movement is finished, but from the time it took, it must have been a pretty decent-sized movement.
"
Token,"Will you stop changing channels and just pick something?
"
Cartman,"What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
"
Token,"This is my room! I'll take the remote from you!
"
Cartman,"Muh uh, 'cause I'll tell my mom on you when our parents get home.
"
Token,"You're a guest here! Your mom isn't in charge!
"
Cartman,"Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
"
Token,"That's the alarm; someone's in the back yard.
"
Cartman,"What?! Who?!
"
Token,"I don't know.
"
Cartman,"I thought I was safe here! Stay there guys, I'll be right back! 
"
Cartman,"Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 
"
Token,"A motion detector. 
"
Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
"
Cartman,"Oh sure!
"
Stan,"Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
"
Cartman,"Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!
"
Kenny,"(I don't really know!)
"
Cartman,"HAAAAGH! 
"
Stan,"Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
Cartman,"I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
"
Stephen Tamil,"Alright guys. You ready?
"
Classmates,"Ready!
"
Stephen Tamil,"Here we GO! 
"
Butters,"Hey, what are you fifth graders doing?
"
Stephen Tamil,"We are the 83%! We are tired of being punished for the fourth grade class! The fourth grade is stickin' it to the other 83% of the school!
"
Jimmy,"Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
"
Butters,"Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
"
Stephen Tamil,"Because your class had Cartman in it, and he's the 1%!
"
Jimmy,"But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
"
Field Reporter 3,"This is it. The inevitable has happened at Occupy Red Robin. It is full-on class warfare.
"
Female Reporter 2,"And now class warfare is breaking out. Apparently it is the fourth grade class versus the fifth grade class.
"
Sgt. Yates,"It's here! The class warfare is finally here!
"
Officer 2,"Yeeah!
"
Cartman,"Hello??  Whoever you are, just give them back! Haven't you done enough to me?! 
"
Cartman,"Muscleman Marc! AAAAAAAA!! AAAAAAAA!! 
"
Cartman,"Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ! 
"
Rumpertumskin,"Eric! Don't come any closer!
"
Cartman,"Who did this to you?!
"
Rumpertumskin,"You said you wouldn't let anything happen to us.
"
Cartman,"Don't worry, I'll get you down!
"
Rumpertumskin,"No Eric, don't come any- 
"
Cartman,"AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
"
Polly Prissypants,"It's okay, Eric. It's over now. 
"
Cartman,"Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
"
Polly Prissypants,"Don't you see? The kids at school were right, Eric. It was time for us to grow up.
"
Cartman,"...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 
"
Polly Prissypants,"Yes, they're gone. And now we can grow up and be together.
"
Cartman,"They were your FRIENDS!
"
Polly Prissypants,"They were holding us back! All the kids making fun of you at school, saying you're not keewl! Your stuffed animals all have to be gotten rid of, don't you see?!
"
Bob,"Dead-bolted. Token!  Token, you in there?! 
"
Cartman,"Polly Prissypants, when people find out we did all this, we're gonna get in total trouble!
"
Polly Prissypants,"No, I thought of everything! It all happened here so that everyone would think Token did it. All the blame will be on him. And we can live happily ever after.
"
Cartman,"There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
"
Polly Prissypants,"Oh no! You're totally right! But I thought my plan was perfect! I failed! I failed you! You have to kill me Eric! So that you don't get blamed!
"
Cartman,"Noho! I've lost every stuffed animal; I won't lose you too!
"
Polly Prissypants,"It's the only way Eric. You have to do it. Please! I can't live with myself after what I've done. Please, you have to do it Eric.
"
Cartman,"Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
"
Polly Prissypants,"Say ""hello"" to the sunrise for me. 
"
Stan,"Dude, what the hell?
"
Kyle,"We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
"
Liane,"My little Eric can sometimes be a bit... dramatic. 
"
Field Reporter 3,"Occupy Red Robin is over. Class warfare has torn apart the 99% and replaced it with the 30%, the 26%, and even little brackets of 5%s here and there. What does this mean for our country? What oes this mean... for me?
"
Officer 2,"Hey! Get down to State Street! They're occupying Macaroni Grill!
"
Field Reporter 3,"Oh hell yeah! I'll occupy me some goat-cheese peppadew peppers! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats.  As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.
"
Butters,"Oh neato, huh fellas?
"
Guest,"Hello boys and girls. My name is David Running Horse... Sawitsky, and I am one sixteenth Cherokee Indian.
"
Cartman,"Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
"
Sawitsky,"There've been a lot of ""stories"" about the first Thanksgiving, and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the Pilgrims look good, and my people being degraded as usual. Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?
"
Butters,"Thanksgiving is about murder?
"
Cartman,"This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?
"
Kyle,"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.
"
Kyle,"Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
"
Cartman,"Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
"
Stan,"We all have to do this report together, dude.
"
Cartman,"You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
"
Kyle,"How is that gonna help?!
"
Cartman,"Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
"
Announcer,"You're watching The History Channel, where the truth is history.
"
Narrator,"A lot has been written about the first Thanksgiving between Pilgrims and Native Americans. but what really happened at that first historic dinner?
"
Cartman,"Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
"
Narrator,"We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens! 
"
Duncan Everton,"In every journal entry we researched from those early Pilgrims, not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there.
"
Narrator,"And what about the food?  Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? 
"
Cartman,"Uh-huh??
"
Kyle,"What? This isn't history.
"
Stan,"Dude, it is called History Channel.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
Charles Biggens,"And if we look in all the journals and aall the history books, there is no reference to stuffing before 1621. So where did it come from? Did it come from space? We just don't know.
"
Narrator,"Did ancient aliens shape the first Thanksgiving? Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form?  What exactly did the Pilgrims experience?  How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? 
"
Kyle,"What??
"
Cartman,"Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
"
Kyle,"We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
"
Cartman,"Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
"
Kyle,"Dude!
"
Cartman,"Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
"
Kyle,"Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
"
THC President,"Yes? A report from where?  Does Congress know about this yet? Try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready. I'll be there as soon as I can. 
"
Wife,"Darling?
"
THC President,"They found something. This could be it. 
"
Cartman,"Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
"
Stan,"...What?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
"
Kyle,"Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
"
Cartman,"See what I mean, you guys? 
"
Agent 1,"Is that them?
"
Agent 2,"That's them.
"
THC President,"You boys have been very busy...  We need to know everything that you know.
"
Stan,"'bout what?
"
THC President,"Have you been contacted by alien life forms?
"
Agent 1,"Did you come across some kind of ship or something?
"
Kyle,"Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
"
THC President,"We are The History Channel.  For years we've been collecting information on Thanksgiving. We're getting close to the truth. And now you boys have exactly the same information. It can't be coincidence.
"
Kyle,"We saw it on your channel.
"
THC President,"What exactly did you seez?!
"
Stan,"That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
"
THC President,"My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?
"
Steven,"Alright, Butters, that's enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain. I'm putting on History Channel.
"
Butters,"Okay Dad.
"
Announcer,"You're watching the History Channel, the only network dedicated to history. Coming up next, it's Monster Quest! Larrh! Followed by Hairy Bikers. Errh! But now, back to Part 3 of Ancient Aliens at Thanksgiving.
"
Narrator,"It has become a widely accepted fact that Thanksgiving was a meal attended by Pilgrims, Native Americans, and alien beings.
"
Stan Marsh,"Stuffing wasn't mentioned anywhere until 1621? And it might have been... alien technology?
"
Narrator,"And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?
"
Kyle Broflovski,"Of course you can't prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can't ""prove"" that... the Pilgrims themselves weren't alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand! Maybe that symbol matches... galaxies in space or something! OooOoOoOooOOO! 
"
Narrator,"Could it be that the Pilgrims we've read about all these years actually came from another planet? History experts like Kyle Broflovski say ""yes.""
"
Kyle,"You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
"
Stan,"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
"
Kyle,"How can they make a show out of this? I wasn't even agreeing with them. 
"
Sawitsky,"What are you doing?!
"
Kyle,"...Uh oh.
"
Sawitsky,"The first Thanksgiving was a space treaty?! Native Americans are aliens?!
"
Kyle,"I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
"
Sawitsky,"Haven't my people been through enough?!  Goddamn you!
"
Kyle,"Ack dude! 
"
Sawitsky,"The white man is gonna PAY for his lies! 
"
Agent 2,"Look at this, sir!  An aerial photograph of Cape Cod where the Pilgrims landed in 1620.  Five Pilgrim settlements, with Plymouth Rock here.  The same symbols appear everywhere in history. 
"
Agent 1,"The symbology lines up to mirrored points in space. If Kyle Broflovski is right, then Plymouth Rock is some kind of wormhole.
"
THC President,"Pilgrims and Indians were the aliens! How did we not think of it?!
"
Agent 3,"Sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things.
"
Agent 2,"True dat.
"
THC President,"True dat.
"
THC President,"Get all those tourists out of here! We need this place secured!
"
Agent 4,"Alight people, let's clear out! We need you ALL to disperse!  This area is under quarantine. 
"
THC President,"Give me a piece of chalk.  Huh... Nothing.
"
Agent 5,"Guess Kyle Broflovski was wrong.
"
THC President,"Well, at least we weren't outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid.  We should've known. Pilgrims couldn't be from space.
"
Agent 6,"Here. You can see it right there. An object clearly fell from the sky and struck the Earth.
"
THC President,"What is it?
"
Agent 6,"It's a Pilgrim, sir. 
"
THC President,"So then, Professor Broflovski was right after all. 
"
Narrator,"Not long ago, it was an accepted fact that civilizations on Earth shared the universe with beings from other planets.  These alien beings visited our world, and once, even settled it, from deep within the galaxy Canis Major, and a distant planet called... Plymouth. 
"
Pilgrim King,"Fellow Pilgrims! The great Captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines! We must prepare for war with the Indians!
"
Indian Chief,"Now it is OUR time! We shall attack Plymouth, and we will take... ALL THEIR STUFFING! 
"
Cartman,"Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
"
Liane,"What hon?
"
Cartman,"Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
"
Liane,"Uhoh, Thanksgiving's still a couple of weeks away, sweetie. I haven't gone shoppies yet.
"
Cartman,"Oh no. Oh NO!
"
Liane,"What is it, hon?
"
Cartman,"Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 
"
Cartman,"You guys have stuffing?!
"
Attendant 1,"Stuffing? Sure. Aisle 17.
"
Cartman,"Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
"
Attendant 1,"It's right there, right on the uh...  wait, that can't be right. Hey, hey Chet. What happened to all the stuffing?
"
Chet,"What are you talking about? 
"
Attendant 1,"We got more in the back, right?
"
Chet,"I just did inventory in the back, it... it was all put out here!
"
Attendant 1,"You mean it's two weeks until Thanksgiving and we're completely out of stuffing?!
"
Chet,"Oh no!
"
Cartman,"No!
"
Chet,"No!
"
Cartman,"NO!
"
Pilgrim King,"You dare come to Plymouth, ambassador?! After attacking our stuffing mines?!
"
Indian Chief,"The stuffing mines were never yours!
"
Pilgrim King,"Wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals, ambassador! This will be war!
"
Indian Chief,"You are in no position to declare war! Your lead commander is nowhere to be found!
"
Pilgrim King,"And how knoweth you that?!
"
Indian Chief,"Word travels fast in our sector.
"
Pilgrim King,"I do not give free bowls of stuffing, what sayest you?! We will take back control of the stuffing mines! 
"
Indian Chief,"Then the Thanksgiving treaty will be off! 
"
Pilgrim King,"And I pray to stuffing that you are wrong.  Where are you, Miles Standish?
"
Sawitzky,"And furthermore, everything Kyle Broflovski said about Native Americans being from outer space was untrue! Native Americans were brutalized, and David Sawitzky's ancestors deserve an apology! It was wrong to mix aliens and real history!
"
Stan,"I don't know, dude. Have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to Mars?
"
Kyle,"Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
"
Stan,"I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, that's true.)
"
Kyle,"Would you guys stop!
"
Sawitsky,"Just keep writing your apology! 
"
Miles,"How now, Indian?! Why hast thy race sent me here to Earth?!
"
Sawitsky,"Huh?  Ack.
"
Stan,"Dude!
"
Miles,"You Indians took me to thy planet, and then cast me here! Why?! 
"
Kenny,"(Go, dude!)
"
Stan,"Yeah, go on dude!
"
Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
Miles,"Hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die?! Tell me, Indian!
"
Sawitzky,"I I uh I'm only one sixteenth.
"
Miles,"Hold your lying tongue!  This shall prove if thou art Indian or not!  Ah, he was not.
"
Stan,"I didn't think so.
"
Miles,"I have been told of your expertise, Kyle of DeVry Institute. I need your wisdom to get back to my planet.
"
Miles,"Into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me!  We must make haste to Cape Cod! 
"
Stan,"Who's this?
"
Miles,"This is Natalie.
"
Natalie,"Hi guys.
"
Agent 7,"Alright, sir. We got some more information on the Pilgrim who crashed to Earth. Thirty seconds after impact the Pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat.
"
THC President,"Who did the truck belong to?
"
Agent 6,"We believe it belonged to Natalie Portman, sir.
"
THC President,"The actress? That doesn't make sense.
"
Agent 8,"It gets worse. All over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing. We don't think it's coincidence.
"
THC President,"You're telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage, this ""Pilgrim"" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by Natalie Portman?!
"
Agent 9,"Look, if anyone knows about stuffing, it's Natalie Portman!
"
THC President,"We have to find Professor Broflovski. He was right about all of this. He'll know what to do.
"
Miles,"We shall make camp here for the night. On the morrow perhaps we can reach Cape Cod. And Thanksgiving may yet be saved.  What is wrong with Kyle of DeVry Institute?
"
Stan,"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
"
Miles,"He seems almost like a Puritan lady whose period hath stopped.  I fear, Kyle, that you still do not know whose side to be on.
"
Kyle,"No, ah I don't.
"
Miles,"It must have been very difficult for you, being the one on your planet with his wild theories that Pilgrims and Indians were not of this world.
"
Kyle,"I actually only just said that sarcastically.
"
Miles,"HA1 Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Then you are only just a remarkably gifted child!  Here, let me show you. Your planet is one of the five.  Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim, and this planet over here nobody really cares about.  The five are connected by a series of wormholes.  My people came to your world, and so did our enemies. But we made a treaty, and for 300 years our people have not fought. But now, the treaty is over.
"
Kyle,"But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
"
Miles,"You can't believe what everyone tells you, Kyle. You have to open your eyes.  Soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to Plymouth, and the stuffing mines can again be ours, for he who controls the stuffing, controls the universe. 
"
A pilot,"Hold it right there! 
"
Agent 10,"We found Professor Broflovski! He is with the Pilgrim! 
"
Miles,"Stay back, all of you! For I will get to Cape Cod and cannot be stopped! Come boys! Let us fight to the death!
"
THC President,"Wait! Stop, stop! Please, Mr. Standish, we are all on the same side here. We know why there's a stuffing shortage. We've been trying to get the wormhole open.
"
Miles,"I trust none but them!  Indians hath betrayed us! I must return to Plymouth so my king can know the truth! 
"
THC President,"PLEASE!  We're the History Channel. We care as much about the truth as you do.
"
Miles,"Then get us to Cape Cod as soon as possible!
"
Pilgrim,"My Lord! My Lord, the battle is lost! We have tried to stop the Indians on their home planet, but yea they are too strong!
"
Pilgrim King,"Then our last chance for survival is gone?
"
Pilgrim,"I'm sorry my Lord. All Pilgrim forces sent to the Indians' planet have been wiped out.
"
Pilgrim King,"And so soon the Indians will be here. Sound the corn horn! We must abandon Plymouth!
"
Indian Chief,"The stuffing mines are ours! 
"
Miles,"Earth is connected to Plymouth by this wormhole here. Once I get back I will assemble my people to attack Indi, and gain control of the stuffing mines. If all goes as planned, you will all have stuffing in time for Thanksgiving.
"
THC President,"But Mr. Standish, I'm afraid it's not that simple. We... tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didn't work.
"
Miles,"Ah ha ha ha! Of course not! You have the correct symbol, but you are missing the keeper of the portal.
"
Agent 11,"The keeper of the... of course! Natalie Portman!
"
THC President,"We were wondering what she had to do with all this! Natalie Portman controls the wormhole!
"
Agent 12,"Our window of opportunity is closing, sir! The wormhole has to be opened now!
"
THC President,"Alright Ms. Portman, we need you to open your wormhole.
"
Natalie,"Mmmmmmmmmm. No.
"
THC President,"Please, Ms. Portman, you've got to open your wormhole right now!
"
Natalie,"Mmmmmmm.  Uh uh.
"
THC President,"Curses and cranberries! I must get to Plymouth now! Do as they say!
"
Natalie,"Mmmmmmmmmm. No.
"
THC President,"There has to be a way to get the portal open! Where's our expert?!  What do we do, Professor Broflovski?
"
Kyle,"I'm not a professor.
"
THC President,"The History Channel said you were!
"
Kyle,"You are the fucking History Channel!
"
Miles,"Please, Kyle of DeVry Institute. There is no more time for squabbles. The universe is at stake!
"
THC President,"You knew everything else. You somehow knew about all of this. You knew it... here.  You must know... how to get Natalie Portman to open her wormhole.
"
Kyle,"So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
"
Natalie,"I had a lot of really close friends growing up, but not any brothers and sisters; I was an only child.
"
Kyle,"Wow, awesome. Um...
"
Natalie,"I have dual citizenship in the United States and Israel.  Oh thanks.
"
Kyle,"Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
"
Natalie,"Well, I went to Harvard while I was acting. I got a BA. But I did classes at the University of Jerusalem too.
"
Kyle,"Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
"
Natalie,"Thanks, that was a lot of fun.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, it was cool, thanks.  Um, so... Is there any way you'd
"
Natalie,"What?
"
Kyle,"You know, could youuu...
"
Natalie,"What?
"
Kyle,"Would you please just open your wormhole?!
"
Natalie,"Oh.  Mmmm...  no.
"
Kyle,"Errh!
"
Natalie,"Mmmmmmmmmm. Okay.
"
Miles,"Yes!
"
THC President,"Alright, let's go, folks! 
"
Natalie,"Just for a sec though. 
"
Miles,"Thank you, Kyle of DeVry Institute. Now the Indians can be stopped and Thanksgiving will be saved!
"
Kyle,"Yeeah, you're welcome. I'm sorry I doubted you. And guys, I'm I'm sorry I acted like a know-it-all. 
"
Stan,"It's cool dude, we understand.
"
Kyle,"I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 
"
Miles,"Now make way, children! For I have a war to fight!  For stuffing!! 
"
Indian Chief,"Take ALL their stuffing!
"
Pilgrim,"The treaty ends now! 
"
Narrator,"With the wormhole once again open, Miles Standish was finally able to command a Pilgrim army.
"
Miles,"Now attack their left flank! Good! They're retreating! Hit them with the anti-Indian device! 
"
Narrator,"The Pilgrims fought off the Indians, making stuffing once again available on all our Thanksgiving tables.
"
Random Voices,"Yea. Stuffing mines. Yea.
"
Narrator,"And now you know the true story behind Thanksgiving.
"
Stan,"Wow, there's a lot about Thanksgiving I never knew before.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, History Channel rules.
"
Narrator,"But was the first Thanksgiving really just about Pilgrims and Indians from space? Or was there something more? Shocking new evidence suggests that the first Thanksgiving might also have been...  haunted!
"
Donald T. Brown,"There is certainly no evidence that the first Thanksgiving dinner was not haunted.
"
Narrator,"The Pilgrims welcomed the Indians, but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave? 
"
Cartman,"Uhhh??
"
Kyle,"Oh, come on!!
"
Stuart,"You think you're man enough to fight me, you little shit?!
"
Kevin,"Yes, 'cause you're a drunk piece of shit, Dad!
"
Mrs. McCormick,"You're both drunk pieces of shit! Both of you sit the fuck down!
"
Kevin,"Shoot him!
"
Announcer,"They're noisy.
"
Man 1,"Fuck you, bitch! 
"
Woman 1,"Fuck you, you son of a bitch! 
"
Announcer,"They're nasty.
"
Woman 2,"You done spilled that on my titties, skank! 
"
Woman 3,"Oww...
"
Announcer,"They're white trash. And when you give them a little Pabst Blue Ribbon , they can't help getting arrested.  Tonight, on an all-new... White Trash... In Trouble!
"
Narrator,"Pabst Blue Ribbon and white trash. It's a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home.  This white trash home in Colorado seems innocent enough. 
"
Kenny,"(Hmmm. What the fuck?) 
"
Narrator,"But the children in this home live in a world of neglect. There's no heating, no groceries,  and if you look closely in the backyard, you can even make out what appears to be a meth lab. 
"
Kenny,"(Mom, the cops are here! Mom, Dad, the cops are here!) 
"
Cops,"Down on the ground! Move it! Let's go! Move move! Get down, now! 
"
Mrs. McCormick,"No! Muh babies! Don't take my babies!
"
Stuart,"You're hurting my arm!
"
Mrs. McCormick,"My babies!
"
Stuart,"You're hurting me!
"
Officer 1,"You have the right to remain silent. Now please look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.""
"
Stuart,"I'm white trash and I'm in trouble. 
"
Officer 1,"Alright, good. Now get in the car! 
"
Cartman,"Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
"
Officer 2,"Just have a seat in there, kids. 
"
Kevin,"Just have a seat in there, kids. 
"
Officer 1,"The mother and father will probably be released from jail on Monday, but I guess the kids are gonna be taken away for good. Child Protective Services is about to talk to them in the soft room.
"
Officer 3,"The soft room?
"
Officer 1,"You know, the room we have set aside for kids to feel safe in.
"
Mr. Adams,"Hi kids, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams and I just need to get some info from you. Does that sound okay?
"
Karen,"Can I see my mommy?
"
Mr. Adams,"No, sorry. Now,  I've been looking over your file and I see you kids have all been horribly physically and emotionally abused.  Oh whoops, that isn't your case file, it's the Penn State University Gazette.  I'm joking, that's just a joke, we like to have fun here.  It is your case file. I was just all like ""it's the Penn State Gazette"" to be like a joke, we have fun. Now listen, you're gonna be put into a foster home, so I need to know... would you like to go to Neverland Ranch, a Catholic church, or Penn State University?  We're havin' fun here, aren't we? I just, I come up with these and the guys, it's good to laugh.  I just asked them if they wanted to go to Neverland, a Catholic church, or Penn State.  I'm a trickster. People say I'm really meant for comedy. Here's my head shot just in case you know anybody.  Can't hurt, right? Okay, now, are we all startin' to feel a little bit better?  Oh come on now, how about that smile? I'm gonna GET  you to smile! I'm gonna GET  you to smile!  A Penn State administrator walks into a bar. Where's that smile? How about this one? Joe Paterno doesn't walk into a police station. Come on, that's a good one.
"
Stan,"Did you hear anything more about what happened?
"
Kyle,"Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
"
Stan,"We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
"
Cartman,"Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
"
Stan,"Really?
"
Cartman,"Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
"
Kyle,"That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
"
Cartman,"Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 
"
Craig,"What are you talking about?
"
Cartman,"Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
"
Officer 2,"Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, we have the new foster kids for your care. 
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Very good, we'll take them from here. Children, enter.  Welcome to your new home. Before we show you around let's get one thing clear: this is a very strict religious household! As long as you live here you will be agnostic!  These are your foster brothers and sisters! They are all strict agnostics! David, do you believe in God?!
"
David,"I don't know...
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Right! There are two bedrooms upstairs! Boys' room and girls' room! Your chores are listed on their respective doors! Follow!  You will eat only at designated meal times! Beverages you may take from the refrigerator as you like! However, in this house you will drink only agnostic beverages!  Dr Pep-er, and Diet Dr Pep-er!  Because what flavor is it?! It is neither root beer nor cola! Nobody is sure what flavor it is, and nobody can be sure! Isn't that right, Melissa?!
"
Melissa,"I don't know.
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Good!
"
Cartman,"This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
"
Butters,"Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
"
Cartman,"Eh yeah?
"
Butters,"So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
"
Cartman,"Heh heh, yeah?
"
Butters,"Well actually, Eric, it's you. 
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Butters,"Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
"
Butters,"Uh, I won't tell anybody.
"
Cartman,"Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
"
Cartman,"Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
"
Kyle,"My name. Is not. ""Kyel.""
"
Cartman,"That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 
"
Liane,"Hi, sweetie.
"
Cartman,"Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
"
Liane,"Oh, what is it this time? 
"
Cartman,"Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
"
Liane,"What, hon?
"
Cartman,"You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
"
Liane,"Eric, I'm working two jobs. Mommy's doing everything she can.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
"
Liane,"Well, we're in a tough economy, Eric. I don't know what else you want me to do about it.
"
Cartman,"We're in a tough economy. You don't know what else I want you to do about it. Life isn't handed to you, Mom! You just can't sit on your ass and expect some money to appear!
"
Liane,"Eric, we aren't that much poorer than most people.
"
Cartman,"Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
"
Liane,"Oh. 
"
Cartman,"IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! 
"
Cartman,"My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
"
Karen,"Huh?  Oh, it's you.  I was wondering when you'd appear. You always come when I'm sad.
"
Mysterion,"You are going to be okay, Karen! You have to keep believing that!
"
Karen,"Why did my mommy and daddy go to jail?
"
Mysterion,"Sometimes, people do stupid things. Sometimes they don't realize what should have come first. Until it's too late.
"
Karen,"But I'm all alone now.
"
Mysterion,"You are not alone. No matter where you go, no matter what you do, I will always be here! Do you understand?
"
Karen,"I'll try, guardian angel.
"
Mysterion,"Don't try, Karen. Do. 
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"What in the name of nobody knows are you doing, Karen?! 
"
Officer 4,"Police man.  Yes. Yes. Alright, thanks for the tip. We'll check it out.  Better call the lieutenant. Looks like we've got another meth lab in town.
"
Officer 5,"Got any needles on you? Any crack pipes?
"
Liane,"Oh, oh, my goodness no. I haven't used drugs in quite a while.
"
Officer 5,"Then why is there a meth lab in your backyard?
"
Cartman,"What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
"
Officer 5,"When will you people learn to lay off the Pabst Blue Ribbon? Now look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.""
"
Liane,"Oh. Ah, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.
"
Mr. Adams,"Hi there, how you doin'? My name's Mr. Adams, and I'm with Child Protective Services.  Here's my head shot.  I just need to get some information from you if that's okay.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, yeah.
"
Mr. Adams,"Okay, now it says here your mother was operating a meth lab.
"
Cartman,"That's right.
"
Mr. Adams,"And it also says here that Penn State prefers to be losing at halftime? Because at Penn State they like when you're a little behind in the locker room. That's a joke. Did you get that one? It's a play on words, we like to have fun here.
"
Cartman,"Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
"
Mr. Adams,"We just - no, we just like to have fun here.
"
Cartman,"Well I'll tell you somethin'! Being from a low-income household isn't funny! Oh heell no, my momma's so poor she opened a Gmail account just so she could eat the spam! 
"
Mr. Adams,"What? What, is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You think you're funny?
"
Cartman,"A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
"
Mr. Adams,"Could be worse.
"
Cartman,"How?!
"
Mr. Adams,"Could be in Happy Valley! On a scale from 1 to 10, how old should you be to stay away from Penn State?
"
Cartman,"Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
"
Mr. Adams,"Two Penn State administrators walk into a butt-!
"
Cartman,"Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
"
Officer 6,"Hawaii?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
"
Officer 7,"Your foster home is here, pretty much the exact opposite of Hawaii.
"
Cartman,"What??  Greeley?
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Come on now! This is not the way we told you to tidy up! Remember? Cleanliness is next to godliness, so make it kind of clean but not too much! Amanda! More ambiguous on the dusting!  Kenneth, answer the door! 
"
Cartman,"What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
"
Kenny,"(What the fuck are you doing here?!)
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"Hello Eric, your room is upstairs to the left. Are you hungry?
"
Cartman,"You're my new mom?
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"You can call me Mom if you like.
"
Cartman,"Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"This is where you'll sleep with your foster brothers. You will be clean, polite, and most importantly, you WILL follow the agnostic code: We cannot know for certain if God or Christ existed. They COULD. Then again there COULD be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything. Can we be CERTAIN there isn't? NO, so it's pointless to talk about. Now say it with me.
"
Cartman,"Goddamn, I've gotta sleep in a room with six other people?! How poor are we?!
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"HEY! We do not take the Lord's name in vain in this house, just in case there is one! Do you understand, or do you need the punishment room?!
"
Cartman,"Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"My name. Is not. Meom!
"
Cartman,"Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
"
Karen,"I'll see you at recess, right?
"
Kenny,"(I'll be there, Karen.) 
"
Cartman,"You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 
"
Boy 1,"Oh hey, Kenny. Who's this?
"
Kenny,"(This is Eric Cartman.)
"
Boy 2,"Does he live with you at the foster home?
"
Cartman,"Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
"
Boy 1,"What are you talking about? The poor kid at this school is Jacob Hallery. 
"
Cartman,"Really?
"
Boy 2,"Yeah, dude. His dad died five years ago and his mom went crazy from depression, so she can't even keep a job.
"
Cartman,"YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
"
Boy 1,"Did he do stuff like this at your old school?
"
Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
Cartman,"Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 
"
Principal,"Eric, at Greeley Elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students.
"
Cartman,"I wasn't making fun of anybody.
"
Principal,"A twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven ""Yo momma so poor"" jokes directed at Jacob Hallery, which ended in a finale with fireworks.
"
Cartman,"I was just teasing.
"
Principal,"Your case worker has been notified, and he is not happy.
"
Cartman,"My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!
"
Mr. Adams,"I know this is a difficult adjustment for you, Eric! But you can't just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who can't defend himself! I mean, what do you think this is?! The shower room at Penn State?! I'm kidding. We like to have fun in our department, so I was like, ""Oh, look. What? Is this like the shower room at Penn State?!"" I joke around. This is my head shot. 
"
Cartman,"Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
"
Mr. Adams,"Oh! Oh, and ""your momma"" jokes are better?! They've been around since the '50s!
"
Principal,"What the hell does this have to do with anything?!
"
Girl 1,"Principal, you've gotta send help to the playground! They're about to beat up that new kid!
"
Jessica,"Aww, look at the new kid and her wittle dolly. You gonna cry some more in class, wimp?!
"
Boy 3,"L-leave her alone.
"
Jessica,"Shut up! You foster twerps are all the same! Come on! Hand over the doll!  Who the hell is this?!
"
Mysterion,"How about you find another little girl to pick on?
"
Jessica,"Mind your business, Peter Pan! 
"
Mysterion,"Karen McCormick is off limits! Do you understand?! Make sure everybody in this school knows! 
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"And if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence, we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence. Nobody knows, nobody can know if any deity is watching over us. Amen.
"
Boy 4,"Except for Karen's guardian angel.
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"What?
"
Melissa,"Where did he take you after he saved you, Karen?
"
Karen,"He just took me back to my classroom. Then he disappeared like always.
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"What have he told you about making up angel stories?!
"
Girl 3,"But we SAW him. He leaped down from the sky.
"
David,"And he kicked the crap out of Jessica Pinkerton. 
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"Stop it, children! We do not speak such certainties in this house!
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Get down to the basement, all of you! It's time for the Punishment Room! 
"
David,"AAAAAAAH!
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Now, did you see an angel?!
"
David,"No, I - no - I didn't see an angel.
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"No, you can't be certain of that! You might've seen one!  Hit him with the Dr Pep-er again.  Are there such things as angels?!
"
David,"Maybe.
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Good! 
"
Karen,"What do we do, Kenny?  Kenny?
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"What is the meaning of life?!
"
David,"It's impossible to knoooow!
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"That's right! 
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"Who could that be? 
"
Mr. Adams,"Mr. and Mrs. Weatherhead, I received some disturbing news that all you're providing the foster children here to drink is soda?
"
Cartman,"Haha, I told on you Mom and Dad!
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"What business is that of yours?!
"
Mr. Adams,"It's my business because Child Protective Services is accountable for these kids!  Have I given you my head shot?
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"Yes, yes, we have that.
"
Mr. Adams,"Okay now, are you only giving these kids Dr Pepper to drink?
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"If we want to serve agnostic beverages in this house, then by Goddish we'll do it! The children you've sent here are undisciplined and talking about the certainty of angels! 
"
Mr. Adams,"Excuse me!  Let's have a look around.
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"What the? Who did this?
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"What is that? 
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"It was like a... little mystery person... flying around.
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Almost like some kind of... agnostic angel. 
"
Mr. Adams,"Oh my God.  What's going on here?
"
David,"We don't know... We can't possibly know...
"
Mr. Adams,"What have I done?  I took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going! I put innocent children in a dangerous environment! What am I, a recruitment coach for Penn State?  It's not funny!
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"There's nothing in there but Dr Pep-er, right? There can't be. 
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"Ohhh...
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"How did that get here?!  It says it's a Pabst Blue Ribbon.
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"What is it?
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"It's like beer... but different. 
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"But how did it get here? 
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Shut your mouth, bitch!
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"You shut your mouth, you filth-fucking asshole!
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Fuck you, bitch!
"
Greeley Officer 1,"You have the right to remain silent. Now look at the camera and say ""I'm white trash and I'm in trouble.""
"
Mrs. Weatherhead,"I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
"
Greeley Officer 2,"Get in the car, you!
"
Mr. Weatherhead,"Wait a minute, I'm white trash and I'm in trouble?
"
Mr. Adams,"No, no, take all these kids back to their parents! We've embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of! It's like a Penn State homecoming party! 
"
Greeley Officer 3,"A false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term, son.
"
Cartman,"I'm not saying it.
"
Greeley Officer 3,"We can do this the easy way, or we can do it hard!
"
Cartman,"I'm not saying it!
"
Greeley Officer 3,"Then we'll add another charge for resisting!
"
Cartman,"Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
"
Narrator,"Three arrests in just one power-packed episode, proving once again that we are all just one Pabst Blue Ribbon away from becoming... white trash in trouble! Sponsored by Schlitz.
"
Stan,"Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
"
Kenny,"(Thanks, Stan.)
"
Kyle,"I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
"
Kenny,"(Good for me.)
"
Cartman,"There he is, there's my buddy.
"
Kyle,"How was jail, fatass?!
"
Cartman,"Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
"
Kids,"Aaaah! 
"
Kenny,"(AAAAHH!) 
"
Stan,"...What the fuck?!
"
Cartman,"Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone.""
"
Character,Line
Stan,"Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
"
Betsy,"Clyde! Clyde! Clyde, get up here! Hurry! 
"
Betsy,"What is that?
"
Clyde,"A toilet?
"
Betsy,"That's right. It's a toilet, Clyde. And where is the toilet seat? It's up, because you left it up, again! We've been through this countless times, Clyde.
"
Clyde,"Okay mom, just not in front of my friends okay?
"
Betsy,"No, not okay. Because you aren't getting the message! What if I'd fallen in? Start listening to me! Put it down! Put it down!  Thank you. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, that sucks, Clyde. A mom shouldn't be able to put rules on toilet-time like that. Toilet-time is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
Kyle,"Is your mom always like that dude?
"
Clyde,"Look, could you guys just not say anything about this in school, please?
"
Cartman,"Of course, man. It's cool.
"
Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 
"
Kyle,"Cartman, it was actually really lame.
"
Cartman,"I know, right. Women are just jealous 'cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap.
"
Butters,"Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
"
Betsy,"Clyde! Clyde!  There you are!
"
Clyde,"Mom?
"
Betsy,"Clyde Donovan, you come home this instant!
"
Clyde,"Why?
"
Betsy,"What have I told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom?
"
Clyde,"Mom, I'm in class.
"
Betsy,"How many times do I have to tell you Clyde? I was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up, again.
"
Roger,"Betsy, come back home. It's just not that big a deal.
"
Betsy,"No, Roger! It's a disgusting habit and I'm sick and tired of it. If I had sat down, I would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina.
"
Butters,"My grandma is from Virginia. 
"
Betsy,"You're coming home right now, and you're putting the seat down where it belongs. Let's go.
"
Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
"
Kyle,"I know, fatass. I was there.
"
Cartman,"His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay.""
"
Kyle,"That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
"
Cartman,"I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
Kyle,"Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
"
Cartman,"Nuh-uh.
"
Kyle,"Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
"
Kyle,"What's going on?
"
Stan,"They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
"
Kyle,"From what?
"
Cartman,"They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
"
Fireman 1,"Hang it there. You're going to be fine okay? Stay with me now. 
"
Fireman 2,"I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.
"
Roger,"What?!
"
Fireman 2,"When she fell into the toilet, she also made it flush. It created a suction that's literally pulling out her insides.
"
Roger,"Can't we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing?
"
Paramedic,"Yes, we'll have to, but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs.
"
Clyde,"But she's not gonna die, is she?
"
Fireman 2,"Why did you leave the toilet seat up, son?
"
Betsy,"Clyde! Clyde!  Clyde, I want you to know I don't blame you for this. We should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up.
"
Clyde,"Mom, I'm sorry.
"
Betsy,"Shhh! Sh! I.. don't... have a lot of time, Clyde. Just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sister's sake, please. Oh, God, please let me go. Let me go. Do it! Do it! Do it! 
"
Clyde,"Mom?
"
Stephen,"I'll always remember Betsy Donovan's kind nature, more than anything. She always treated people with dignity and respect.  What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I'm sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. 
"
Linda,"I'd like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn't a woman's responsibility to see that the seat is down. It's a man's responsibility to put it down. It's not that hard. 
"
Women,"Yeah, yes. That's right.
"
Man With Grey Hair,"Putting the toilet seat down isn't that hard. So is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl?
"
Woman With Brown Hair,"My God, people. This is a funeral! Please have some respect! There's a little boy here who has lost his mother!  He'll never see her again, because he couldn't take that sixth-tenths of a second to put the seat down when he was done peeing.  And now little Clyde's mother is dead, and the blood is on his penis. 
"
Terrance,"Crap. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip.
"
Phillip,"Oh, hello, Ugly Bob. 
"
Ugly Bob,"Hello Terrance. Hello Phillip.
"
Cartman,"Mom, get the door! 
"
Terrance,"You're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob.
"
Ugly Bob,"How come you guys say stuff like that?
"
Phillip,"Because you're goddamn ugly... 
"
TSA Agent 1,"Hello ma'am, we're the Toilet Safety Administration.
"
Liane,"The what?
"
TSA Agent 2,"After the recent tragedy, new safety regulations require us to check every toilet for security. Can we come in?
"
Liane,"Oh sure. 
"
Cartman,"Who are these buttholes?
"
Liane,"It's the Toilet Safety Administration, hun. They're gonna do something to the potty.
"
Cartman,"My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
"
Cartman,"Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! 
"
TSA Agent 1,"Oh yeah, we're gonna have to completely redo this ma'am.
"
Liane,"Oh.
"
TSA Agent 1,"You need to have this counter moved to a minimum of six inches, but we'll go ahead and install your safety belt.
"
Liane,"Safety belt?
"
TSA Agent 2,"Federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in.
"
Cartman,"Dude, you can't make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump.
"
TSA Agent 2,"This is for your safety. A woman died, you know.
"
Cartman,"Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
"
Kyle,"Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
"
Attorney,"Uh-uh, go on.
"
Stan,"We keep trying to tell him maybe this all isn't his fault. Maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened.
"
Kyle,"So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
"
Attorney,"You can always sue somebody.
"
Kyle,"All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
"
Attorney,"You got it.  Here we go, the inventor of the toilet.  Sir Thomas Harrington. In England, died in 1692.
"
Kyle,"Aw, he's dead?
"
Stan,"So then we can't sue him?
"
Attorney,"Why not? You can always sue somebody. It's just gonna take some special protocol. We would have to perform a sue-ance. 
"
Jimmy,"A...a...a...a sue-ance?
"
Attorney,"You bet. Here at Hoffman and Turk we specialize in suing the dead. If you hire us, we'll work hard, for you.
"
Stan,"Wow, really?!
"
Kyle,"You hear that Clyde?
"
Attorney,"Now look. I'll be asking all of you to have a very open mind and a willingness to face you fears.  I warn you boys. A sue-ance can be very... expensive.
"
Stan,"How expensive?
"
Attorney,"How much do you have?
"
Kyle,"Clyde got $3000 from his mom's life insurance
"
Attorney,"Wow! That's exactly how much a sue-ance costs. 
"
Jimmy,"Wow, that's weird.
"
Randy,"Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer.
"
Officer,"If you're stting on the toilet you need to wear your safety belt, sir.
"
Randy,"Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
"
Officer,"The address here is 260 Avenue de los Mexicanos?
"
Randy,"Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
"
Officer,"Gotta wear your safety belt or you could fall in.
"
Randy,"I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 
"
Officer,"The law is the law sir.  You can pay this by mail or appear in court on that date. Have a good day, sir. 
"
Randy,"Yeah thanks.  Asshole.
"
Officer,"You say something?
"
Randy,"No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 
"
Cartman,"This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
"
R. Booth,"Shoes off, belts off! Sharp objects go in the plastic tray!
"
Man 1,"This is inhumane.
"
R. Booth,"Shut up! Sir.
"
R. Wiley,"Taking a dump today, ma'am?
"
Woman 2,"No, just need to pee.
"
R. Wiley,"I'll just need to check inside your aaasshole. 
"
Cartman,"Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
"
R. Wiley,"All right, do you mind if I touch your balls, sir?
"
Cartman,"What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
"
Gerald,"Okay, I'm done.
"
R. Wiley,"Alright, sir. I just need to check inside your aaasshole. 
"
Gerald,"I don't need you wiping my ass for me. I'm a grown man.
"
R. Wiley,"Yes, you're a big boy, aren't you, sir?
"
Gerald,"Yeah, I'm a big boy.
"
R. Wiley,"That's a big boy, sir.
"
Gerald,"I'm a big boy. I took a big boy poop.
"
R. Wiley,"Yes.
"
Attorney,"Alright boys, sit down and clear your minds. The sue-ance is about to begin. Doors and windows are locked. You boys have your $500 in cash ready?
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Attorney,"Alright. Then I've got this big bowl set here to catch all money we're about to make. Now. Let us start.  We call out to the land of the dead. Sir John Harrington. Your presence is requested. Appear to us, John Harrington. We have a subpoena.
"
Jimmy,"Jeez, it's not working.
"
Attorney,"John Harrington. My client is due compensation for negligence.  What is your name, spirit?
"
Spirit,"Burns. Jimmy Burns. What's it to you? Who are you, mugs?
"
Attorney,"That's how people talked in the past.  We have a claim against a John Harrington. Do you know him, spirit?
"
Burns,"Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't. Might need a little something to jar my memory.
"
Attorney,"We gotta grease him. Put a hundred in the box. 
"
Burns,"Oh yeah, Harrington. I know him. Always going round inventing things.
"
Attorney,"Yes, that's him. Is his personage amongst you?
"
Burns,"Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn't.
"
Attorney,"Give him another hundred. 
"
Burns,"Yeah, I've seen him around, alright. He was just down that way, bragging about some porcelain machine and whatever. 
"
Spirit 2,"Nooo! Nooooo!
"
Attorney,"By the power of Christ, we sue you!  By the power of Christ, we sue you!
"
Spirit 2,"You can't sue me! 
"
Attorney,"Quick, put the other $300 in the box!  This actually went really, really well. Always happens some bureaucrat tries to block the first sue-ance attempt, but this was good. We'll get him tomorrow.
"
Clyde,"So that's it?
"
Attorney,"Yeah, we're gonna need about 400 more dollars tomorrow. I know you're sad about your mom, Clyde, but don't worry. We're going to win this thing.
"
R. Wiley,"Put your coffee in the plastic tray please, sir.
"
R. Booth,"Shoes off. Belts off.
"
Randy,"Yeah yeah.
"
R. West,"Got any metal in your pockets?
"
R. Wiley,"I just need to check your asshole.
"
Randy,"So ridiculous.
"
R. Wiley,"Asshole clear.
"
Randy,"Thanks.
"
R. West,"Pick your coffee up, sir. 
"
R. Wiley,"Anyways, he says I'm getting nothing anyway, so then you can...
"
Randy,"Hey, what's that thing? 
"
R. Wiley,"That's a camera. It's a security camera.
"
Randy,"Aw, you people have me on camera now?
"
R. West,"It's okay, sir. There's just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location.
"
Cartman,"Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
"
People,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Hey, yeah. If there's no toilet seats, the government can't make toilet seat laws. 
"
Jimbo,"Alright, let's do it.
"
Sheila,"No, no, hold on. If the seat can't raise up the men will just pee all over it.
"
Man 3,"No, we won't.
"
Woman 3,"Yeah, you will.
"
Cartman,"Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
"
Woman 4,"How about we agree to that, if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate.
"
Stephen,"Well, no, you can't make men sit down to pee. How could we play sink the boat?
"
Randy,"Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
"
Man 4,"What about us loggers? Hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine?
"
Cartman,"Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
"
Man 4,"But folks been logging round these parts for generations. My pappy taught me logging. And his pappy before him.
"
Randy,"Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 
"
Attorney,"Oh, oohh! The spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena. Motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff? Ah, aaaah!
"
Jimmy,"What's happening now?
"
Attorney,"Our motion has been denied by the judge.  Concentrate boys!  This specter is like none I have ever encountered. I managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim.
"
Stan,"So what does that mean?
"
Attorney,"We'll hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow. We'll need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each.
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Attorney,"Hang in there, Clyde. This is all to make the world a safer place.
"
Monitor Man,"Security breeeach!
"
Reporter,"An embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration. Shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through TSA security with a gun and a baby. Leaving the toilet seat up. The head TSA chief of operations had this to say:
"
R. West,"Shiiiit!
"
Reporter,"Meanwhile, outraged civilians are claiming they're finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy.
"
Randy,"What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
"
Woman 5,"And the toilet seat was up.
"
Randy,"We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
"
Cartman,"That's right.
"
Randy,"Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
"
Cartman,"Yeah.
"
Randy,"It is time for us all to grow up.
"
Cartman,"That's right.
"
Randy,"It is time for a sue-ance.
"
People,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Wait, what? What the fuck is a sue-ance?
"
Reporter 2,"Tom, I'm standing outside the South Park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor Sir John Harrington. Now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead, lawyers are gonna try and sue him.
"
Attorney,"Sir Thomas Harrington, your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions.
"
Spirit,"No! No!
"
Attorney,"You will be sued, spirit. Thy liability is without question.  Appear before this court, Harrington.
"
Spirit,"Never!
"
Attorney,"Quick, everyone, get our all your money. 
"
Betsy,"Clyde? Clyde?
"
Clyde,"Mom?
"
Betsy,"This lawyer is a fraud. He has been swindling you and your friends for your money.
"
Attorney,"Fuck me, it's a ghost.
"
Betsy,"You can't sue the dead, Clyde. Putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette. It's common sense, Clyde!
"
Cartman,"Oh boy, here we go.
"
Betsy,"Don't try and blame mommy's death on anything but your failure to something I have asked you time and time again to do.  It's your fault!
"
Spirit 2,"Now hold on a second! It's not anyone's fault.  I am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine.
"
P. Sanchez,"There he is, Sir John Harrington.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Quick, sue him!
"
Sir Harrington,"You can't sue me.  You're all using my toilet invention the wrong way.  When you have to sit and take a Sir Harrington you're supposed to be facing this way.  So you can use the little shelf for your books, and your quill and your ink.
"
Butters,"A-ha! I told you you should sit on it that way! I told you!
"
Sir Harrington,"Why would I design it so that when you're finished taking a Sir Harrington, you have to stand up, turn around and look right down at your Harrington to flush. That's gross.
"
Randy,"Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
"
Sir Harrington,"Of course! Why do you think I designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole? 
"
Randy,"That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
"
Cartman,"So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot.
"
Clyde,"That's not what I said.
"
Cartman,"Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
"
Cartman,"Clyde, you there? Hello? 
"
Randy,"Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
"
Sharon,"What?! Randy!
"
Randy,"Just trying to leave without being rude.
"
Marvin,"Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson.  Come here, Billy.  You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy , to impress all the ladies .
"
Sharon,"Go ahead and open it, Stan.  Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? 
"
Marvin,"That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds.
"
Randy,"Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
"
Marvin,"Six thousand dollars.
"
Randy,"Six thousand?!
"
Marvin,"It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
"
Randy,"Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!
"
Sharon,"It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!
"
Marvin,"Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?
"
Cartman,"Nice bolo tie, Stan.
"
Stan,"Thanks. 
"
Cartman,"Bolo ties are...  really in right now. Cool you have one.
"
Stan,"Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
"
Cartman,"No, dude, it's... badass.
"
Stan,"It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
"
Kyle,"That... was six grand?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
"
Cartman,"...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
"
Stan,"I know!  I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!
"
Kyle,"Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it.
"
Clerk 1,"You didn't steal this, did you?
"
Stan,"No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
"
Clerk 1,"It's 14-karat gold, diamond and turquoise. I'll give you fifteen dollars.
"
Stan,"...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
"
Clerk 1,"Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit.
"
Stan,"Fifteen bucks?!
"
Kyle,"Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
"
Stan,"Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! 
"
Cartman,"You may suck our collective balls, sir! 
"
Kyle,"Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
"
Stan,"Yeah! Here's one. 
"
Clerk 2,"These are real diamonds, right?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, you can test them.
"
Clerk 2,"Okay. Eight dollars.
"
Stan,"This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
"
Clerk 2,"Nine dollars.
"
Clerk 3,"Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos?
"
Stan,"I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 
"
Clerk 3,"Fourteen-karat gold gets yaaa $14 a gram on the open market, got about... 4 grams here...  It's not really worth my time. I guess I can give you a six-layer burrito for it.
"
Stan,"A six-layer burrito?
"
Kyle,"You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
"
Clerk 3,"Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going!
"
Stan,"Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
"
Dean,"Okay, folks, we are com-, half-way complete with today's broadcast.  You wanna get in on these deals, call now. Next item is... This is item number 4 5 7 8 1 1 1.  Look at these stunning earrings. These are genuine faux sapphire earrings. Fourteen karat gold, 86 carat faux sapphire. Faux is a French word. Got an x in it, but you don't need to pronounce the x. How do you like that for prestigious? These earrings normally go for $6,000,000. We're gonna sell these today fer...  $320!That's a steal. Now th-oh, there go the phones, they're lightin' up. I believe we have a sale? Do we have a sale? Yea- let's get her on the line. Hello? Who am I speakin' with?
"
Vivian,"Hello... my name is... Vivian.
"
Dean,"Vivian, you just got a heck of a deal. What's your last name, sweetheart?
"
Vivian,"Oh I... I can't remember.
"
Dean,"You can't remember. Well can you remember your credit card number?
"
Vivian,"3 7 1 5-
"
Dean,"Hold on, Vivivan, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay-
"
Kyle,"Dude, that's terrible!
"
Cartman,"I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
"
Stan,"But, how do they get away with that?
"
Cartman,"This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
"
Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
Cartman,"For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
"
Kyle,"That's the chemical equation for gold?
"
Cartman,"That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
"
Kyle,"...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
"
Kenny,"(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
"
Cartman,"Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!
"
Dean,"Oh my gosh, can you believe this? Somebody's about to get this $20,000 topaz and copper ring for just four thousand bucks.  We've got our buyer on the line. You buyin' this as a gift, sir?
"
Caller,"No, I'm buying it as a gift! For my grandson Billy!
"
Stan,"Grandpa? 
"
Dean,"How about that, folks? That is Brazilian emerald, finest emerald available. We're letting this oen go fer... fourteen ninety five , EZ Pay. We call it that to save you time. EZ is an abbreviation of easy. Fourteen ninety five, EZ Pay an... What's that? Okay, alright, I just got word, we are droppin' the Z from EZ Pay. It's now just E Pay.  By usin' the word E Pay instead of takin' all that time to say EZ Pay, we're savin' you a second of time, and those seconds add up. Go ahead and try it: say E Pay five thousand times.

Literally. Pass this one down to your kids, your grandkids.  Show 'em your life had meaning.
"
Stan,"Grandpa.
"
Marvin,"Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? 
"
Stan,"She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.
"
Marvin,"Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all.
"
Stan,"She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.
"
Marvin,"Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy...  Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?
"
Stan,"Yes, Grandpa.
"
Marvin,"I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face.  I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. 
"
Stan,"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
"
Cartman,"Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-
"
Butters,"Whoops! 
"
Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck?!
"
Butters,"Sorry. My arms hurt.
"
Cartman,"""My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
"
Leroy,"Hey! How much will you give me for this? 
"
Cartman,"Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
"
Leroy,"Okay. 
"
Cartman,"We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
"
Dean,"And that's it, we just sold this bracelet to Ms. Marcia Tubbs. Martha, thank you so much for your call. You just got yourself a heck of a deal on this one. You there Marcia?
"
Marcia,"Yes.  I'm lost. I'm lost walkin' on the freeway.
"
Dean,"Alright, you're lost walkin' on the freeway? Enjoy the Tiger's Eye Aquamarine bracelet. Alri- okay, what should we do next? Oh I see one. Here's a good'un. Lemme...  Lemme... lemme set the stage for you here: you're goin' to that seniors' cocktail party? It's bingo night and you're lookin' for somethin' to wear? How about a 13 carat panzoto-panzanite ring. This is-oh! We got a caller already on this one! Hello sir, you must be a fan of panzoto-panzanite.
"
Stan,"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?
"
Dean,"...What's that?
"
Stan,"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
"
Dean,"Okay, we're gonna sell this ring for just thirty-seven ninety five.  How's that? 
"
Stan,"I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
"
Dean,"Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad.
"
Stan,"No i wouldn't.
"
Dean,"Yes you would.
"
Stan,"No, because I really want you to kill yourself.
"
Dean,"Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?
"
Stan,"I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
"
Dean,"Alright, I tell you what: I'll bring the lawsuit down to twenty-nine thirty-nine- 
"
Stan,"Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
"
Dean,"Well, you think it's funny, but that's, that's callin' up and tellin' someone to kill themselves; that's not a joke.
"
Stan,"I'm not joking.  Do it.
"
Cartman,"Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
"
Caller,"Hello?
"
Cartman,"YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?
"
Mrs. Appleby,"This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?
"
Cartman,"Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
"
Mrs. Appleby,"I'm sorry?
"
Cartman,"Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am.
"
Mrs. Appleby,"Thank you.
"
Cartman,"Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!""
"
Mrs. Appleby,"...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-
"
Cartman,"Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
"
Mrs. Appleby,"Goodbye.
"
Cartman,"Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
"
Stan,"Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
"
Manager,"Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places.
"
Stan,"Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: ""Whoever smelt it, dealt it!""
"
Kyle,"Yeah!
"
Kenny,"(Fuck yeah!)
"
Manager,"We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually ""Mayii nahii chahatapahnii""
"
Kyle,"What does that mean?
"
Manager,"""Whoever denied it,  supplied it."" 
"
Stan,"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
"
Butters,"We aren't makin' that much, fellas.
"
Stan,"You're not?
"
Twirler 1,"Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is ""Whever smelt it dealt it"" 
"
Kyle,"Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!""
"
Twirler 2,"You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from!
"
Twirler 3,"What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean?
"
Twirler 4,"That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.
"
Cartman,"Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!
"
Clerk 4,"Ohhhh welcoooome! Welcome to discount jewelry stohhhhh! 
"
Cartman,"Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.

Clerk 4,"Ohhhhh you so good foh biiiziness!  You so clehhvahh.

Cartman,"I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings.

Cartman,"Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
"
Clerk 4,"Ohhhh you make so good chooice! Oh it's beauuutiful!  Look it's beauuutiful! 
"
Cartman,"And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred.
"
Clerk 4,"Oh, that's best one! You so clevohh!  You take advantage o'my low pricess! 
"
Cartman,"How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
"
Clerk 4,"You got good eye,  You so clehhvahh. I getting taken advantaaage! You rike to fuck an Asian lady?
"
Cartman,"What d'ja say?
"
Clerk 4,"I know, you walk by my stoh and you say ""Oh, there's a nice Asian lady. I think I go in and I fuck hurh,"" you Asian-lady fucker you!
"
Cartman,"Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
"
Clerk 4,"Oh, I pay thousands! And you come heuh an' fuck me!
"
Cartman,"Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
"
Clerk 4,"Nono, you fucked me!
"
Cartman,"Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
"
Butters,"Oh sorry, sorry. 
"
Cartman,"You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
"
Stan,"You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 
"
Cartman,"You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
"
Butters,"Sorry! 
"
Cartman,"-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
"
Kyle,"We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
"
Cartman,"No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
"
Stan,"Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
"
Kyle,"What's he doing?
"
Stan,"Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
"
Stan,"So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
"
Marvin,"Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend.
"
Stan,"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. 
"
Marvin,"Oh, for me?  Oh! My God. There she is.  Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot.  Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Marvin,"I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck.
"
Stan,"Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.
"
Marvin,"That's a good idea. 
"
Dean,"Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello?
"
Caller 1,"What are you waiting for? Kill yourself.
"
Dean,"Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself.
"
Caller 1,"He was right. Do it.
"
Dean,"Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry&#160;? Yes. Hello, sir?
"
Caller 2,"You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls.
"
Dean,"Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it.
"
Caller 2,"New, you're scared. You got, you got lady balls. 
"
Caller 3,"Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings?
"
Dean,"Yes ma'am!
"
Caller 3,"They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself?
"
Dean,"Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?!
"
Caller 3,"Put it against your temple and pull the trigger. 
"
Mitt,"I know the people are going to say, oh you should only practice it this way or that way.
"
Rick,"I believe in capitalism too. I believe in capitalism for everybody.
"
Newt,"What he said, which I find mildly amazing, was that he thought I would have a hard time debating Barack Obama.
"
Ron,"We faced something much much greater after World War II.  We had ten million coming home at once. What did we do then? Some liberals said we need more work programs-
"
Stan,"Tango, Tango, I'm in position.
"
Kyle,"Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
"
Stan,"It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
"
Kyle,"Alright, Butters. Bring it in.
"
Butters,"Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
"
Kyle,"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
"
Agent 1,"We might have a problem.
"
Agent 2,"What's that?
"
Agent 1,"We just got word somebody might try to Faith Hill this event.
"
Agent 2,"Lock down the whole perimeter. Nobody is Faith Hilling, not on my watch! 
"
Stan,"I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
"
Agent 3,"Hey, somebody is under the stage.
"
Kyle,"Go Cartman! 
"
Butters,"We got it. We got it!
"
Stan,"Go, go, go.
"
Cartman,"Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. 
"
Reporter,"First, there was planking.  People taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the Internet. Planking was soon replaced by owling.  And after the super bowl by bradying.  But the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs.  It's called Faith Hilling. And all around the world people are doing it.  Kids, adults, and even notable celebrities are getting into the act.  But as Faith Hilling is more and more popular, the question on everyone's mind, who will be the first to die doing it?
"
Lamont,"I have been sent here because you children are playing with fire!  Faith Hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying. From football quarterback to football singer.
"
Cartman,"Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
"
Lamont,"I know you all think what you're doing is new and hip and cool. But the truth is memeing has been around a long time. We're gonna watch a film strip now, that's a little dated but I think it gets the point across. 
"
Speaker,"For many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time. The latest meme has also become the most deadly. It's called tebowing.
"
Speaker,"This is Ryan and Barkley. They're about to learn how dangerous tebowing can be.
"
Ryan,"Here is a good place. I'll do it right here.
"
Barkley,"I don't know, Ryan, you sure this is a good idea? 
"
Ryan,"Stop being a scaredy-cat. It will just take a second, how could I get hurt? 
"
Barkley,"Okay, hold still.  What's that?
"
Ryan,"A traaain! AAAAAA!
"
Barkley,"RYAN!
"
Ryan,"No, no! Nooo! No, no, no, no, noooo! 
"
Barkley,"Ryan!
"
Ryan,"Learn from me. 
"
Woman 1,"This sure is a nice car, Tommy.  Would you like to get a picture of me tebowing in it?
"
Tommy,"Sure.  What is that?
"
Woman 1,"Oh my God, it's coming!
"
Tommy,"God no!  No, no!
"
Woman 1,"Tommy, d-did you get the picture?
"
Tommy,"Hold on, wait, hold on! 
"
Woman 1,"Hurry, hurry! AAAAA!  Eeeaaah! 
"
Man 1,"Be careful up there, Pete.
"
Pete,"Just go on and take the picture. 
"
Speaker,"These youths paid with their lives for tebowing. When they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes: peace signs , bunny ears  and fake wiener  Maybe you think this doesn't apply to you, maybe you think your memes are safe. Or maybe you're watching this in the future and tebowing has been replaced by some other meme. Well, if you are watching his in the future,  get off your flying cellphone scooters and THINK. Just remember.  Use the approved poses if you want to be a memer. Peace signs, bunny ears, and fake wieners. 
"
Cartman,"Oh, God. That was boring.
"
Kenny,"(Totally!)
"
Kyle,"So, what do you want to do now?
"
Cartman,"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
"
Stan,"Oh, that's a good idea.
"
Butters,"What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
"
Cartman,"Butters, Faith Hilling defines our generation.
"
Butters,"Well, count me out.
"
Kyle,"You're gonna give up on Faith Hilling just like that, Butters? How could you?
"
Butters,"Well, I'm scared. 
"
Craig,"Hey, did you see today's newspaper?
"
Cartman,"Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
"
Craig,"You guys made the front page.
"
Cartman,"Really? 
"
Stan,"Dude, we are on the front page!
"
Cartman,"Yes!
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, dude!)
"
Stan,"Can we get a different pose, please? 
"
Cartman,"What's it say, what's it say?
"
Stan,"It says... Oh, oh no. It says Faith Hilling is now all like 2000-late.
"
Cartman,"What? Let me see that. 
"
Kyle,"How can that be? Already?
"
Stan,"Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
"
Kyle,"How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
"
Stan,"""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive.""
"
Cartman,"Taylor Swifting? What the fuck is that?
"
Stan,"That's all it is? 
"
Cartman,"You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
"
Kyle,"But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
"
Cartman,"I can't believe people take the time to do this garbage.  This has to be stopped, you guys.
"
Boy 1,"Okay. Hold it there. Okay. That's good, don't move. 
"
Cartman,"How is this Kyle? This good? 
"
Kyle,"Yep, that's great. 
"
Cartman,"Cool, these will be good uploads.
"
Boy 2,"Hey, what are you doing?
"
Cartman,"Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
"
Boy 1,"Oh God. Faith Hilling is so February 2012.
"
Stan,"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
"
Boy 2,"Come on guys. It's not worth it. We can do our Taylor Swifting somewhere else.   Knock it off!
"
Cartman,"Why don't you make me? 
"
Lamont,"Yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe.  Faith Hilling, Taylor Swifting. These are things that will get you killed!  That's a loaded .38. How many of you think it's a smart idea to put a loaded .38 on a 9-year-old's desk? Well, if safety doesn't matter to you go ahead, pick the gun up.
"
Butters,"Oh, that's okay. I think...
"
Lamont,"Pick the gun up! You might as well. Swifting and hilling is like playing with a loaded gun! Do you all understand my point?
"
Kids,"Yes, sir.
"
Lamont,"Good. Now put the gun in your mouth.
"
Butters,"HA?!
"
Lamont,"Hey! You're following plankers and tebowers, so put a loaded gun in your mouth! DO IT!  Everybody take a good look.  This is what you're doing every time you play with Internet memes. You're playing roulette with your lives! 
"
Man 2,"Professor Lamont, we need to talk.
"
Lamont,"I will be right back. 
"
Man 2,"You're an expert on memes, Professor Lamont.
"
Lamont,"Yes, what is this about? 
"
Man 3,"We need your expertise, sir.
"
Man 2,"Have you ever heard of another species, memeing on the Internet?
"
Lamont,"Another species? What are you talking about?
"
Man 3,"We were hoping perhaps you could help us understand...  this.  Cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the Internet, with bread around their heads. Cat breading, it's called. It's just such an odd thing to do, we thought would you explain it to us.
"
Lamont,"They're evolving. Cats are evolving. 
"
Man 3,"Sorry?
"
Lamont,"There are two ways a species evolves. Physically from genes and culturally from memes. Just like genes, memes replicate, mutate and adapt.
"
Man 2,"We're having a hard time following you here.
"
Lamont,"Look. In the 70s there was fonzing.  Which replaced the outdated mustaching.  In the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting.  But even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s.  Even before photographs humans memed for portraits. All the way back to the Egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking. 
"
Man 2,"You are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme?
"
Lamont,"If they're putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures,  they're proving to be almost as intelligent as we are. 
"
Cartman,"Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
"
Stan,"Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
"
Cartman,"I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
"
Stan,"That's a cool idea
"
Kenny,"(Oh, fuck it, dude.) 
"
Kyle,"W-what's the matter, Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
"
Stan,"What seems pointless?
"
Kenny,"(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
"
Kyle,"Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
"
Kenny,"(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
"
Stan,"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
"
Cartman,"Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
"
Reporter,"Two Boulder children died today while Oh Long Johnsoning in a battling cage. Oh Long Johnsonning is of course the latest Internet meme which involves putting oneself in a risky situation and then seeing how many times you can say ""Oh Long Johnson"" on video before getting out of the way.
"
Boy 3,"You ready, you ready?
"
Boy 4,"I'm recording, go.
"
Boy 3,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. O-Oh Long- 
"
Boy 4,"Larry!
"
Reporter,"This latest Internet meme is shocking. But most shocking of all is the person who started the meme isn't a person at all, but a cat who seems to have no regard for people's safety.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
"
Reporter,"The cat is now under arrest and awaiting trial for its part in the teenager's death.
"
Stan,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
"
Boy 1,"Yeah, that's good. Now go back the other way.
"
Stan,"Oh Long Johnson, Oh Long- 
"
Cartman,"Dude, what's going on?
"
Stan,"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? 
"
Kyle,"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
"
Boy 1,"He's not Taylor Swifting, that's old stuff.
"
Stan,"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
"
Cartman,"Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
"
Kyle,"Benedict Arnold. 
"
Stan,"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
"
Kyle,"Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
"
Boy 1,"If you guys wanna keep Faith Hilling, I'm sure people are still doing it at the old folks home. 
"
Stan,"You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
"
Kyle,"You guys are sellouts.
"
Cartman,"Come on, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"You're freaking sellouts!
"
Cartman,"It's okay, man, come on.
"
Lamont,"What the hell do you think you're doing? Do you have any idea when you play with memes you're playing with fire? 
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Lamont,"Oh, very funny. People are dying out there. Is that what you want?
"
Cat,"Oh Long Jeeea-
"
Lamont,"You cats want a war? Because that's what you're going to get!
"
Cat,"Oh oh oh.
"
Reporter 2,"Long ago there was tebowing, which evolved into Faith Hilling. But the latest memeing craze, Swift-Johnsoning, may now also have its rival.  A brand new meme, where people video themselves wearing trench coats and talking about the dangers of memeing. They call it ""reporting"". And safety officials say that it's dangerous and potentially fatal.  Oh! Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
"
Little Boy,"What are those boys doing, daddy?
"
Dad,"Oh, I think they're Faith Hilling, Bobby. It's a little before your time.
"
Little Boy,"How droll. 
"
Cartman,"Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah, good idea. 
"
Doctor,"Hey, you kids Faith Hilling in front of my clinic? 'Cause I got a couple of patients in here that could use a good time machine.  Get it? 
"
Man 4,"Go back to the 90s! Faggooots!
"
Kyle,"We have to face it, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"I know. I know Kyle. 
"
Kyle,"I really thought it was gonna last.
"
Cartman,"I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
"
Kyle,"It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
"
Cartman,"No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
"
Kyle,"I-It's good that it became something else.
"
Cartman,"And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
"
Reporter,"Household cats have evolved into a species as intelligent as humans. Will this mean war between our two life forms? In an attempt to try and communicate with the leader of cats, experts have sent in the ambassador of people.
"
Ambassador,"Hello.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Ambassador,"Meow, meow.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Ambassador,"Long Johnson.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Ambassador,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Cat,"Oh- Oh Don Piano.
"
Ambassador,"Oh Don Piano.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Ambassador,"Oh Don Piaaano.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Jon-Jon-Johnson.
"
Ambassador,"Oh lala lionde. Oh long John- Don piano. Don piaaaano.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson. 
"
Ambassador,"I'm not sure but I think it said war between our species is inevitable, that evolution cannot be stopped and cats will rise. It said we cannot coexist and then said oh don piaaano and then and then something about seeing the streets of human cities running red with the blood of their children.
"
Stan,"Okay, that's good, a little higher.
"
Cartman,"Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, that's awesome.
"
Stan,"OK, whenever you're ready.
"
Mr. Kitty,"Meow.
"
Cartman,"No, kitty, you have to be quiet.
"
Mr. Kitty,"Meow.
"
Cartman,"No kitty! That's a bad kitty! 
"
Boy 1,"Wow, what's this?
"
Kyle,"What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
"
Stan,"Alright, go Cartman.
"
Cartman,"Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
"
Girl 1,"That's pretty cool.
"
Stan,"Yeah, that's cool. It's awesome.
"
Kyle,"It's super awesome.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
"
Mr. Kitty,"Meow, meow.
"
Cartman,"SHUT UP, KITTY!
"
Reporter 3,"With the inevitable species war looming, our country's brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats. It's called putty-whistling. And the question on everyone's mind... Who will be the first person to die from it? 
"
Mitt,"W-well, you know, I ran for president four years ago. This was the position I described when I ran four years ago...
"
Rick,"If you wanna be an American the first thing you should do is respect-
"
Newt,"To ask a very simple question. How big of a scale of change do we want in Washington.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Newt,"I started working in the governor wing in 1974.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Piaano.
"
Newt,"I'm gonna say two things...
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Mitt,"I have five sons, five daughters in law, sixteen grand kids, and they're the joy of my life.
"
Cat,"Oh Lalalonde.
"
Newt,"I was wrong when I figured it out. You were wrong when you didn't.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Rick,"It's, It's not the most attractive thing to go out there and say, look it took me ten or twelve years to figure out it was wrong-
"
Stan,"Fox trot standing by at position alpha.
"
Kyle,"Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
"
Kenny,"(This is Tango. I have the goods.)
"
Stan,"Standing by in three seconds.
"
Kyle,"Two, one. Go Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Let's do this. 
"
Kyle,"Cartman? Go, Cartman.
"
Stan,"Come on, dude. Hurry.
"
Cartman,"No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Do it, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.
"
Stan,"Wow!
"
Cartman,"We gotta get serious while we’re in our prime.
"
Man 5,"Have you ever seen Faith Hilling so good?
"
Cartman,"Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.
"
Cat,"Oh Long Johnson.
"
Cartman,"Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
"
Reporter 3,"And so in the face of war a little boy reminds us all what being human really means. The message is unclear. But it doesn't matter as long as you give the audience a song, celebrity bashing, and Republican hopefuls dancing around with boobies. It's called pandering and all over the country people are-  Oh! Oh Long Johns- 
"
Sheila,"Yes, yes, this whole coming week is the Jewish holiday of Passover. Yes, it's all about how Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt. Very good! So on Friday, all Jewish people will celebrate Passover with a seder dinner.  Because God commanded the Jews to only eat bread that hasn't been given yeast to rise.
"
Cartman,"Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
"
Sheila,"Yes, yes, one week from seder dinner on Friday to the next Friday.
"
Cartman,"Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 
"
Sheila,"Well, because in ancient Egypt, God passed over the houses marked with the blood of a lamb. 
"
Cartman,"So interesting, wow. 
"
Kyle,"Get out of here.
"
Cartman,"Oh, hey, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Get. Outta here! 
"
Cartman,"Well, I better be going. Thanks so much Ms. Broflovski, I learned a ton.
"
Sheila,"Well, you're very welcome.
"
Kyle,"What are you gonna do?
"
Cartman,"Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
"
Kyle,"No?
"
Cartman,"Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
"
Kyle,"What does that have to do with Passover?
"
Cartman,"All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 
"
Attendant,"Alright, next please. Signing up for the Easter egg hunt? 
"
Butters,"Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
"
Craig,"Yeah, I can't wait for Sunday.
"
Kenny,"(Me, too.)
"
Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
"
Craig,"Jewpa what?
"
Cartman,"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
"
Craig,"Okay.  So anyways, are they saying what time the event starts?
"
Cartman,"Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
"
Butters,"You mean it's like, like a monster?
"
Cartman,"It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
"
Token,"Nuh-uh!
"
Cartman,"Yeah-uh, Token! Don't think it won't come after you just because you're black!
"
Clyde,"You guys, check this out! 
"
Cartman,"Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
"
Butters,"AAAAAAHHH! 
"
Cartman,"Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
"
Kyle,"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
"
Cartman,"I'm trying to protect people. And why are you so quick to try and cover up Jewpacabra's existence?
"
Kyle,"I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
"
Cartman,"Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
"
Kyle,"If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
"
Butters,"Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
"
Cartman,"Butters.
"
Butters,"AAAAAHHH!
"
Cartman,"Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
"
Butters,"No, it's a school night!
"
Cartman,"Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
"
Cartman,"Look at these dense trees and brush. Oh yeah, this is exactly the kind of forest Jewpacabra likes to hide in.
"
Butters,"You think Jewpacabra is here?
"
Cartman,"Pretty sure Jewpacabra was here.
"
Butters,"Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
"
Cartman,"You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
"
Butters,"Oh God, I'm scared.
"
Cartman,"JESUS IS A LIE!
"
Butters,"Eric, stop it!
"
Cartman,"Shh! Help me call it out, Butters.
"
Butters,"I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
"
Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
"
Butters,"Jesus is a lie?
"
Cartman,"No way Jesus was son of God, huh, Butters?
"
Butters,"Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
"
Cartman,"Sh! You hear that?
"
Butters,"Oh, hamburgers.
"
President,"We started Sooper Foods to give people a place to buy groceries that was fun and safe. We are not canceling our Easter Egg hunt because of some wild story!
"
Cartman,"I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
"
Employee 1,"That wasn't a dog?
"
Cartman,"It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
"
Employee 2,"What?
"
Cartman,"I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
"
Employee 1,"Mr. Billings?
"
Mr. Billings,"There's two things that separate Sooper Foods from all the other grocery stores: Fun and safety. What do you think, Peters? What are the chances that this 'Jewpacabra' is real?
"
Peters,"I'm estimating somewhere around .000000001%.
"
Mr. Billings,"We can't afford to take that chance. Get this kid whatever he needs.
"
Mr. Billings,"So where are we heading first?
"
Cartman,"We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 
"
Mr. Billings,"The Bahamas?
"
Cartman,"That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
"
Cartman,"Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 
"
Mr. Billings,"Where to now?
"
Cartman,"Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
"
Kyle,"Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
"
Cartman,"People thought Atlantis was a myth, Kyle, but I was just there. I've explored the depths of Atlantis, and now I'm about to prove a new species exists. I'm a little James Cameron.
"
Kyle,"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
"
Cartman,"These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
"
Matt,"Look at its trajectory. It heads directly to the right. 
"
Cliff,"It can't be human it's too low to the ground. What do you think, Bobo?
"
Bobo,"Bobo thinks scary!
"
Matt,"It's definitely something. I'm thinking a Sasquatch.
"
Cliff,"It's not big enough to be a Squatch.
"
Matt,"So it's a baby Squatch?
"
Cliff,"That's what I'm thinking.
"
Cartman,"I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
"
Matt,"Jewpacabra?
"
Cartman,"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
"
Bobo,"Oh, Jewpacabra, that sounds scary!
"
Cliff,"But it makes total sense. If we rule out a human and a baby Sasquatch, Jewpacabra is all we really have left.
"
Cartman,"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
"
Mr. Billings,"All the kids will be so disappointed.
"
Bobo,"Whoa, look at this! I just did the heatie thermal thingie to the video! It's all orangie! 
"
Cliff,"But it's supposed to be all yellow-y. My God! This really is proof of a Jewpacabra!
"
Cartman,"Heh. What do you mean? 
"
Cliff,"We've never seen this before! It really is true!
"
Cartman,"Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
"
Matt,"No it's impossible. Look at the zoomy in. If I drop image of a dog next to it...  That thing is way to big to be a dog. And check out the thermals coming off of it.
"
Bobo,"That's the thermals. They make a proof and the thermals!
"
Matt,"That's right, Bobo. Whatever this thing is it's mean and angry as hell.
"
Cartman,"Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
"
Matt,"I'll tell you one thing, kid, you're pretty brave.
"
Cartman,"Why?
"
Cliff,"'Cause you took the video of this thing. It's not gonna like that.
"
Matt,"If it is a Jewpacabra, he's gonna be coming after you. 
"
Cartman,"There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
Cartman,"Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 
"
Cartman,"Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
"
Cartman,"Guys?!
"
Butters,"It's all quiet out front, Eric.
"
Cartman,"Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
"
Butters,"He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
"
Cartman,"What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
"
Butters,"Hey, Eric.
"
Cartman,"It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
"
Butters,"Well, we got scared so we're next door at Wingstreet. 
"
Cartman,"Wingstreet?!
"
Butters,"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
"
Cartman,"Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
"
Mr. Billings,"Alright, grab him.
"
Cartman,"HUH?!
"
Employee 3,"You say the Jewpacabra hunts for anything Easter, and now it's looking for you. 
"
Cartman,"Get me outta here! PLEASE! HEELP!
"
Mr. Billings,"Look, we're sorry. But if it's you that Jewpacabra wants, we don't have a choice.
"
Cartman,"OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
"
Mr. Billings,"Just a little blood to try and draw it out. We just can't risk the creature showing up tomorrow. Our entire business is based on fun and safety.
"
Cartman,"This isn't safe or fun!
"
Mr. Billings,"Maybe it won't even show up. Maybe we'll all make it out of this okay?  Oh fuck, we better get out of here. 
"
Cartman,"NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
"
Mr. Billings,"Hello young man. Let me start off by saying Sooper Foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company.  But... if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on Easter children, we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat. Thank you. 
"
Cartman,"Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
"
Kyle,"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
"
Cartman,"Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
"
Cartman,"It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! 
"
Cliff,"What'dya think, Bobo?
"
Bobo,"No doubt about it! It's a three foot tall bunny-man!
"
Matt,"I told you! Bunny people must be a throwback to paleotardic times! Shoot it Bobo!
"
Bobo,"Bobo shoot it! 
"
Cartman,"Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- 
"
Bobo,"Bobo got it! Bobo got the bunnymaaan!
"
Matt,"Good shot, Bobo!
"
Cliff,"Now what do we do?
"
Matt,"I know. Let's go get a show about it on Animal Planet.
"
Cliff,"Good idea.  Wait wait wait wait. We're gonna need to take the evidence.
"
Bobo,"Alright.  I got the evidence right here. The dart gun I shot the bunnyman with.
"
Matt,"Alright! Come on, let's go!
"
Cartman,"Ugh... what... where...
"
Cartman,"Ugh... what?  What's going on?
"
Man 1,"The plagues! The plagues are upon us! Run!
"
Cartman,"It's raining frogggggsss!  Kyle! Kyle, my Hebrew friend! Did you see that it's raining frogs?
"
Kyle,"Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
"
Cartman,"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
"
Cartman,"Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
"
Kyle,"It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
"
Cartman,"What does that mean?
"
Kyle,"It means Jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the Pharaoh from letting us go.
"
Cartman,"Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
"
Kyle,"That's just how God is.
"
Cartman,"You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 
"
Cartman,"Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
"
Pharaoh,"It'll be okay, my son. The weather will clear.
"
Cartman,"But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
"
Pharaoh,"It's a complicated political issue, my son. An economic social issue that needs time. We can't let them leave, but is it really all that different from when the north didn't let the confederate states leave the USA?
"
Cartman,"Wow, that makes sense. Don't think anyone can deny that. 
"
Pharaoh,"Poor frogs. I feel so badly for them.
"
Cartman,"But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
"
Pharaoh,"Hah, I don't think God would do such a thing, little one. No matter what happens, we can't let ourselves believe in the Hebrew version of God. We believe in a just Lord who would never murder innocent children.
"
Cartman,"I love you, dad.
"
Pharaoh,"And I love you son. And our love grows.
"
Cartman,"And our love grows
"
Both,"And our love grows
Like the mighty river of the Nileriver of the Nile
See it flow
We'll never be apart
"
Cartman,"Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
"
Kyle,"This is what God told us to do!
"
Cartman,"No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
"
Kyle,"You'll see! 
"
Cartman,"Noooo! 
"
Kid 1,"What's happening to us? 
"
Cartman,"Noooooo! 
"
Child,"Mom! Don't let God kill me! 
"
Cartman,"Noooo! 
"
Man 2,"Care for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?!
"
Cartman,"No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 
"
Pharaoh,"Son! We were wrong! I WAS WRONG!
"
Cartman,"We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
"
Cartman,"No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
"
Mr. Billings,"There are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping: Fun and Safety. On this beautiful Easter morning, we are thrilled to give back to he people of South Park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number...  4 in fun and number 6 in safety. Let the hunt begin. 
"
Cartman,"I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
"
Butters,"Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
"
Cartman,"Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
"
Kyle,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"I-I know what you're thinking Kyle. But I really do believe in Judaism now. I'm not lying.
"
Kyle,"I know, you're not.
"
Cartman,"Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
"
Kyle,"Happy Passover, Cartman. 
"
Cartman,"Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
"
Butters,"Heh, h-hey fellas. 
"
Kyle,"Where's your lunch, Butters?
"
Butters,"OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
"
Stan,"Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
"
Butters,"...Yeah. 
"
Stan,"That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
"
Butters,"Naw, I'm not a tattle-tale.
"
Stan,"Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
"
Butters,"Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.
"
Craig,"So then just get a bigger bully to beat the bully up.
"
Butters,"Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
"
Cartman,"He has a point.
"
Kyle,"Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
"
Craig,"Yeah, life sucks sometimes, but it'll pass.
"
Stan,"I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
"
Red,"Good for you, Stan. It's nice somebody in this school has some balls.
"
Cartman,"I have balls.
"
Red,"Yeah, little squishy boba-tea balls.
"
Cartman,"Still balls.
"
Kyle,"Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
"
Butters,"My Grandma?
"
Grammy,"Well, so then your cousin Albert, Linda, actually has two girls now. One is three and the other's about little Butters' age, I think.
"
Stephen,"Well, speak of the devil.
"
Linda,"Butters, what happened to your eye?
"
Butters,"Grandma, ca-can I talk to you for a second?
"
Grammy,"Well sure, you come and sit right here next to Grammy.
"
Butters,"Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
"
Stephen,"Well, sure, I guess. We'll go make some tea.
"
Grammy,"Oh some tea would be lovely.  What's up?  Huh? You think you're  tough, huh?
"
Butters,"I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
"
Grammy,"Think you're fuckin' tough, huh?  You don't look fuckin' tough.
"
Butters,"Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.
"
Grammy,"No, you're a little faggot!  You got any more money? Huh?
"
Butters,"No, you took it all!
"
Grammy,"Why don't you do something about it?!  Do somethin', you little bitch! You're Grandma's bitch!
"
Linda,"Here we go. 
"
Grammy,"Oh, there's the tea. Tea for me. How lucky.
"
Linda,"And your favorite lemon bars.
"
Grammy,"Goodness, what a treat this is.
"
BB Founder,"Mr. Mackey, what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country. Bullying has become an epidemic, I'm afraid, and we at Bully Buckers TRADEMARK are trying to stamp it out. What is your school's policy on bullying?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh, well uh w-we think that bullyin' is... is, is bad... m'kay, and uh, and when we see bullying in the school, we tell the students, you know, that... uh that that's bad. m'kay?
"
BB Founder,"Aha, well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh who said?
"
BB Founder,"He didn't want that disclosed.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh, he's a little Anonymous Andy?
"
BB Founder,"We would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking.
"
BB Founder,"You believe positive thinking is really what's critical in schools right now? What's wrong with you?!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Wull I mean it kind of wo-uhuh works out.
"
BB Founder,"No, shut up! What kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign?! Bullying needs to be stopped! Now! This afternoon!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Wah-eh jus- will we he-?
"
BB Founder,"Wuhhh duhhh. You may only have an Internet degree, but why don't you start acting like you're a school counselor and not an uninformed backwards little dork! M'kay?! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Attention students: today we will have an... assembly... on the subject of... bullying. M'kay?  The assembly is mandatory. M'kay? You'd better show up. 'Kay?
"
Red,"Butters? Your grandma's looking for you.
"
Butters,"My grandma??
"
Red,"She said to meet her outside behind the school.
"
Butters,"Oh hamburgers! 
"
Grammy,"Hey twerp!  You went and narc'd on me!
"
Butters,"HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
"
Grammy,"I heard somebody brought in an anti-bully counselor! Thought I wouldn't find out, you little narc?!
"
Butters,"Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
"
Grammy,"Oh look, what's this over here?  Ohoh, it's a narc puck. This is what narcs have to put in their mouths. Awww, it's got piss all over it. 
"
Butters,"Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
"
Grammy,"Put it in your mouth! Put it in your fuckin' mouth!  Ohhh hellow.
"
Mr. Adler,"Oh, sorry. Uh, this door isn't supposed to be locked.
"
Grammy,"I'm sorry, Uh I needed the restroom and my grandson brought me to this one. Isn't that right, Butters?
"
Butters,"Yes...
"
Mr. Adler,"Butters you goofball. I'll show you to the girls' room, ma'am.
"
Grammy,"Oh thank you so much.  You narc again and you're fuckin' dead! Fuckin' dead, you got it?!
"
Mr. Adler,"This way, ma'am
"
Grammy,"Oops, I'm coming. 
"
BB Founder,"What makes a bully?  The truth is there are more bullies at your school than you even think. And the student who lets bullying happen is just as bad as the bully himself. Come on out, Lorraine.  I asked your school mate Lorraine here to help me out.  Are you bullied in the school, Lorraine?
"
Lorraine,"...Yes.
"
Bucky Bailey,"Kids pick on you, call you names?
"
Lorraine,"...Sometimes.
"
Bucky Bailey,"What kind of things do they say to you?
"
Lorraine,"...Ugly ...neh-nerd.
"
Bucky Bailey,"Do they say ""Nice pants. Why do you wear them up to your tits?""?
"
Lorraine,"No...
"
Bucky Bailey,"Bullying affects everyone. And only if the entire school is united against it can bullying ever be stopped.  Go, go, get out of here.  Now what we at Bucky Bailey's Bully Busters TM like to do is get the schools to make an anti-bullying video. So who would like to be the young student director in charge of our video?  We just need one student to be the leader of our anti-bullying campaign.  What? Are you all chicken?  Nobody wants to be in charge of the anti-bullying video? 
"
Stan,"I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
"
Bucky Bailey,"Ooooo, you're a big man?! You wanna show what a big man you are?!
"
Stan,"No, I just... I think bullying has gotten out of hand. And it needs to be stopped.
"
Red,"Good for you, Stan. 
"
Riley,"He's cool.
"
Clyde,"You wanna know who I hate?! I hate that kid Butters! He's a dork!
"
Jimmy,"Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! 
"
Stan,"Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
"
The Kids of South Park Elementary,"Bullying isn't cool. Bullying is lame.
Bullying is ugly and has a stupid name.
For a healthy world, bullying's unfit.
And I think I know what we should do to i-it.
Do do do do do to i-it.
Let's all get together and make bullying kill itself.
Bullying's an ugly thing
Lets shove its face in the dirt and make bullying kill itself.
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.
"
Cartman,"Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
"
The Kids of South Park Elementary,"We can make it stop. We can stomp it out.
We can beat its ass until it starts to cry.
Let's gang up on it and tell it it smells
And beat its ass worse if it ever te-lls.
If if if it ever te-lls.
Lets all join together to try to make bullying kill itself.
It'll be fun to see just how bad we can make it feel
and make bullying kill itself.
Woah-oh. Woah-oh. Woah-oh.
"
Cartman,"My heart says ye-es (ye-es ye-es) but my vajayjay says no-o
"
Butters,"Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
"
Jason,"Stupid! (stupid stupid)
"
Pete,"Ugly! (ugly ugly ugly ugly)
"
Kyle,"Pansy.
"
Older Girl,"Dork!
"
Butters,"Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
"
Stan,"Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
"
Butters,"Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
"
Stan,"Butters, you're the star of the video!
"
Kyle,"He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
"
Stan,"Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?
"
Stan,"Kyle? Dude, where are you going?!
"
Kyle,"Why are you doing this, Stan?
"
Stan,"To stop bullying.
"
Kyle,"You're gonna stop bullying.
"
Stan,"YES.
"
Kyle,"With Cartman singing about his vagina.
"
Stan,"...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
"
Kyle,"Don't, don't act for me, Stan! Really?! Because every minute I'm watching this video become less about awareness and more about you!
"
Stan,"Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
"
Kyle,"Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
"
Stan,"What the hell does that mean?
"
Grammy,"Oh heavens to Betsy Linda. This is such a yummy yummy ham. I just love your cooking. 
"
Stephen,"Our Linda certainly knows her way around a pork.  What's the matter, Butters?
"
Butters,"Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. 
"
Stephen,"Oh. Well don't fart on Grandma. She's tryin' to enjoy her ham.
"
Butters,"Okay Dad, I won-aaaaah! Gaaaah-ow. 
"
Stephen,"I'll get it. 
"
Grammy,"Linda, is that a new clock on the wall?
"
Linda,"Oh yes. Stephen and I got that last month. It's from Germany, I believe.  I just love the cute little canarian on the dial. And, every hour it chimes. 
"
Stephen,"Your friends wanted to see you, Butters.
"
Stan,"Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
"
Grammy,"Oh, an anti-bullying video? How adorable. 
"
Stan,"Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
"
Butters,"HAAAAA! 
"
Stan,"I know, right?! 
"
Bucky Bailey,"Whassup?! 
"
Stan,"Oh, hey.
"
Bucky Bailey,"You went and made a video and sold it without lettin' me know.
"
Stan,"Huh?
"
Bucky Bailey,"Doin' a video was my idea! It's the property of Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers TM, you got that?! 
"
Stan,"But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
"
Bucky Bailey,"Oh, it's been stwessful?!  What's wrong with you?! Kids are getting bullied at school and with this money, Bucky Bailey's Bully Buckers ™ can finally become the legit organization it deserves to be! You greedy, selfish, little PRICK!  Oh what? You gonna kwy?
"
Stan,"No.
"
Bucky Bailey,"No, go ahead, kwy. Let me see ya.  Let me see you kwy. 
"
Butters,"We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
"
Grammy,"Oh, look, it's Captain Pussy!  You can't stop me, Captain Pussy! Don't even try!
"
Professor Chaos,"Grandma? but how di-
"
Grammy,"I got inspired when I came across your gay little costume in your closet.  Now come on, Captain Pussy! Time for you to get your Gummi bears!
"
Professor Chaos,"No! Grandma please, nnnot Gummi bears!
"
Grammy,"Come 'ere! 
"
Professor Chaos,"Ahh! Grandma! 
"
Grammy,"Stand up for yourself! Fight back! Be a fucking man!
"
Professor Chaos,"I can't.
"
Grammy,"Then it looks like you get... Gummi bears!  Gummy bears! 
"
Professor Chaos,"Awww! Eewww!
"
Nick Jabs,"What's up? I'm Nick Jabs, president of the movie company that bought the bully video. 
"
Bailey,"Oh what? Stan Marsh got you to come talk to me?! That little cliché conflict resolution Kevin!
"
Jabs,"The video was conceived, written, and directed by the South Park student body, you got that?!
"
Bailey,"It was my idea. I told the students to make the video and I-and I produced the entire thing! I deserve to have my name on it!
"
Jabs,"Yeah, only problem is America doesn't give a SHIT about an old fart with a Captain Kangaroo haircut! They wanna believe kids did something on their own.  Here's a cease and desist letter from our lawyers. If you ever claim any authorship of the video again, we will sue you for everything you have!
"
Bailey,"But... but this was gonna be the thing that finally made Bully Buckers™ a national organization.
"
Jabs,"Oh, you gonna kwy?! Oh don't kwy, you'll look bad with your wittle Captain Kangaroo haircut! 
"
Cartman,"'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 
"
Kyle,"Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
"
Cartman,"We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
"
Kyle,"I don't wanna go to your stupid movie premiere!  And don't tape that to my locker!  Oh God. 
"
Stan,"What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
"
Kyle,"Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
"
Stan,"Butters is totally fine with it, dude.
"
Kyle,"Yeah? Well Butters is ten! He doesn't exactly know what's best for him and neither do you!
"
Stan,"Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
"
Kyle,"What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
"
Stan,"Oh yeah.
"
Kyle,"Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
"
Stan,"This video can change how people think about bullying! It needs to be seen by everybody, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"If it needs to be seen by everybody, then why don't you put it out on the Internet for free?!  Well?!
"
Stan,"...What, what was the question again?
"
Kyle,"If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
"
Stan,"...Get, get out of here, Kyle! I'm trying to go to the bathroom!
"
Kyle,"Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
"
Stan,"Why does he keep saying that?
"
Dr. Oz,"We all know that bullying has become an epidemic. Like AIDS, bullying is escalating and is spread mostly by penises. But now a few school kids are trying to make a difference with a video to make bullying kill itself.  I'm joined by the film's director as well as the weak little boy who's the main subject of the film. Stan, congratulations on all your success.
"
Stan,"Well, I just got tired of seeing people like Butters getting pushed around, and I knew I had to do somethin' about it. 
"
Dr. Oz,"And how about you? What would you like to say to your bully out there?
"
Butters,"Oh uh, nothin'.
"
Dr. Oz,"Come on, this is for everyone who's been a victim. What do you wanna say to bullies all across America? Go ahead.  Right now. Say it.
"
Butters,"Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
"
Dr. Oz,"Do you hear that, bullies? Stop making kids say things on your TV shows!  What else do you wanna say, Butters?
"
Butters,"Please, leave me alone.
"
Dr. Oz,"Leave him alone! But that doesn't work, does it Butters?
"
Butters,"No it doesn't.
"
Dr. Oz,"Tell us in graphic detail what the bully does to you?!
"
Butters,"Stop it!
"
Dr. Oz,"Come on, this is for America!  Do you realize that in America, ohohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to go to school because of bullying?!  Don't you care?! You'd better care! 
"
Mr. Jabs,"What the hell were you thinking?! Everyone just saw that the bully victim in your movie is actually a violent psychopath!
"
Stan,"I didn't know.
"
Mr. Jabs,"This could kill our box office. People are gonna come after us now, saying we didn't check our facts!
"
Stan,"I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
"
Mr. Jabs,"It's your fuckin' movie! Now I'm gonna have to work overtime with Marketing to make sure people still sympathize with our victim! Jesus, just get the fuck out of here! I've gotta go to the bathroom!  Uh oh.
"
Jesus,"My child,  have you ever heard of a place called Hell? It's eternal fire, and it's gonna hurt real bad.
"
Mr. Jabs,"Uh... 
"
Jesus,"Oh, what are you gonna do? Kwy now?
"
Butters,"Grandma? I did it, Grandma.  I finally stood up for myself. I got real mean and I beat the shnozz our of Dr. Oz.  I can't lie, it felt kind of good.  At first. But since then all I have is just... a kind of dark, empty feeling. Then I realized... that's how you must feel. All the time.  Poor old Grandma. You know, I've I've been gettin' lots of advice how to deal with you. Stand up to you, tell on you... But I kind of realize there's just people like you out there. All over the place. When you're a kid, things seem like they're gonna last forever. But they're not. Life changes. Why you won't always be around. Someday you're gonna die.  Someday pretty soon.  And when you're layin' in that hospital bed, with tubes up your nose, and that little pan under your butt to pee in, well I'll come visit ya. I'll come just to show you that, that I'm still alive and I'm still happy. And you'll die. Bein' nothin' but you.  'Night Grandma. 
"
Stan,"Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?
"
Clyde,"You didn't hear?! Now that America knows Butters was actually a violent psychopath, they're saying you made a bullcrap bullying video!
"
Stan,"Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
"
Cartman,"The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
"
Red,"You made us look like uncaring idiots!
"
Craig,"Yeah. Boooo!
"
Stan,"How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
"
Timmy,"Boooo!
"
Stan,"Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!
"
Stan,"I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
"

"
Stan,"Kyle! 
"
Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell. 
"
Kyle,"AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 
"
Cartman,"Somebody help us! 
"
Narrator,"Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with no way out.  The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"
Kyle,"We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 
"
Cartman,"Kyle, hurry! 
"
Stan,"Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
"
Narrator,"For four elementary school boys. an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonight's episode of ""I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining"".
"
Cartman,"Oh God!
"
Stan,"No!
"
Stan,"Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
"
Narrator,"It's the last day of Spring break,  and all over the small mountain town of South Park,  students are trying to have as much fun as possible.  For ten year old Stan Marsh and his friends Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the last day has come too soon.
"
Stan,"We really had spent the whole spring break watching TV and playing Xbox, you know, so, we, we wanted to go out and do something really adventurous.
"
Kyle,"We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
"
Cartman,"Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
"
Kenny,"(What?!)
"
Cartman,"Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.
"
Kenny,"(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
"
Cartman,"No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
"
Stan,"Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
"
Kyle,"And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
"
Cartman,"Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
"
Kyle,"We've definitely not done that before!
"
Stan,"I think there's a place just outside of town. I'll see if my uncle Jimbo will drop us off.
"
Kyle,"Cool! Ziplining.
"
Cartman,"Ziplining. Hell yeah.
"
Narrator,"Within thirty minutes, the boys are getting a ride to the ziplining outfitters from Stan's uncle Jimbo. 
"
Cartman,"We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
"
Cartman,"Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
"
Kenny,"(Dude, it's just a fever blister!)
"
Cartman,"Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
"
Narrator,"It's the idyllic spring break getaway with friends and laughter. 
"
Clerk,"Hey, you guys here for the 2 o'clock zipline tour?
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Clerk,"All right, let me get you some helmet and some gear and we'll get up there and hit that fresh nar nar.
"
Kyle,"And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.""
"
Clerk,"All right, you guys look ready to zipline!
"
Cartman,"Alright!
"
Clerk,"Okay, just follow me over to the waiting room and we'll have you take a seat with the others.
"
Stan,"And we were like, ""Other? We have to do this with other people?"" 
"
Woman 1,"Hi there.
"
Man 1,"Hello.
"
Woman 2,"Hi
"
Narrator,"The boys have just made a sobering discovery.  For ten year old Stan Marsh, the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down.  The average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family.  But, in a tour group, the brain has to work overtime, acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour.
"
Woman 2,"Hey, how are you?
"
Stan,"Good. How are you?
"
Kyle,"So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
"
Clerk,"Alright, our last zipliners are here. 
"
Man 2,"Sorry we made you wait, everybody. 
"
Narrator,"Inside Kyle's mouth, the muscles contract to force a smile, even though in his brain, Kyle is thinking, ""Dude, fuck you!""
"
Kyle,"We don't mind.
"
Cartman,"Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
"
Clerk,"Welcome to Backcountry Adventures! Well hey there Michael!
"
Michael,"Hey there Michael. 
"
Stan,"It was... I don't know, ten, maybe fifteen minutes of pure hell. 
"
Michael,"Oh, and don't forget... to take in the nar. Back to you, Michael.
"
Michael,"Thanks Michael.  Anybody have any questions?
"
Cartman,"...No.
"
Man 2,"I have a question: Can we review the best ways to hold a rope again? 
"
Stan,"""Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?""
"
Michael,"Let's get out there and get zippin'! 
"
Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
Cartman,"Finally!
"
Narrator,"The boys think their ordeal is over, but what they don't realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse.
"
Michael,"Here we go guys! Zipliniiin'! 
"
Guide 1,"Everyone just step on in the shuttle. 
"
Stan,"...Shuttle?
"
Kyle,"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
"
Michael,"It's about forty-five minutes.
"
Narrator,"It's a devastating blow. For Kyle, it's almost too much to bear.  His brain is already lacking excitement, and now just the word ""shuttle"" makes Kyle's brain fire neurons  that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be. 
"
Cartman,"Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 
"
Michael,"Alright guys, should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar. Why don't we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit?
"
Stan,"Uh that's okay.
"
Man 3,"Well my name's Pete Nichols and this is my wife Donna, and uh... make a long story short, we came out here to see our relatives who live down in Moab. They uhhh been livin' there about twenty years now, and uh, long story short, they told us that as long as we were in the Rockies we should try ziplining, so, long story short, we looked around in the newspapers and on the Internet and... on billboooards, and... you know, make a long story short, we found this company and thought we'd give 'er a try, so then we called and, we made a reservation, and that's when, you know, long story short, we just thought- 
"
Narrator,"It's almost three o'clock, and the boys are still on the shuttle.
"
Michael,"We're gettin' close. Are you guys gettin' psyched?!
"
Adults,"Wooo!
"
Narrator,"But what the boys don't realize is that a massie storm is brewing.  Last night, Eric Cartman had kung pao spaghetti from California Pizza Kitchen.  Inside Eric's stomach, the kung pao has just met with the Del Taco he ate for breakfast. It has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque BK toppers that have been building up for months.  And now, to compensate for all the annoying tourists, Eric is ingesting massive amounts of Mountain Dew.  The caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas.  When the gas is released, it carries with it tiny particles of Eric's fecal matter.  Fecal matter which floats up and into Kyle's nasal passage. 
"
Kyle,"Dude, did you fart?!
"
Cartman,"Mmmm, no?
"
Michael,"Alright buys, we're here! 
"
Stan,"Thank God. 
"
Michael,"Alright, here we are. Looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today. Uh, but before we climb up and start ziplining, does anyone care to know about these trees' biology?
"
Cartman,"The trees' biology?
"
Michael,"We are running a little late, but if anyone really wants to know, we could take a few minutes.
"
Stan,"I think we're good.
"
Man 2,"I'd like to know about the biology of the trees.
"
Michael,"Okay, well, this is a Ponderosa pine. It covers a more extensive area than other Ameri-
"
Stan,"So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 
"
Michael,"Alright, remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work.  Now, when you're about halfway down the zipline, the camera's gonna take your picture, so when I call out ""Shockabra!"", look up and give the camera a nice ""shockabra"" . Alright, you ready?
"
Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
Michael,"Ready to do some ZIPPIN'?
"
Cartman,"Yeah.
"
Michael,"Alright, let's hear you say ""Zipliiine!""
"
Cartman,"Zipliiine. 
"
Michael,"Shockabra! 
"
Guide 1,"Woohoo! Alright, nice zip!
"
Kyle,"Well? How was it, Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
"
Stan,"Oh, really??
"
Cartman,"Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
"
Michael,"Alright Kyle, give me a ""Zipliiine!""
"
Kyle,"Zipline. 
"
Michael,"Shockabra! 
"
Kyle,"It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
"
Narrator,"After a grueling twenty minutes, waiting for everyone else to ride the zipline, the boys relaize they have just wasted hours of their time. And that, is when the unthinkable happens.
"
Michael,"Alright guys, let's get movin'! Only ten minutes till our next zipliiine! 
"
Cartman,"""The next zipline? What are you talking about?""
"
Kyle,"E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
"
Michael,"This is Zipline Tours. We got sixteen more to go.
"
Stan,"And it was like WHAM. 
"
Kyle,"STOP!
"
Cartman,"NOOOO!
"
Guide,"Everyone back in the shuttle!
"
"Kyle, Cartman","NOOOO! 
"
Narrator,"The boys realize that their ziplining nightmare has only just begun. 
"
Guide,"Anyone have any questions about the creek we're about to cross?
"
Man 2,"Yes.
"
Boys,"AAAA! 
"
Adults,"""Ack"" went the little frog one day. ""Ack"" went the little green frog...
"
Cartman,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
Michael,"Let 'er rip! 
"
Man 4,"Zipliiine!
"
Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
"
Michael,"Next zipline's up here, we call it the Terminator.
"
Kyle,"Wugh!
"
Narrator,"Trapped in an unforgiving mountain wilderness with a tour group.
"
Pete,"But, you know, to make a long story short, I woke up this morning and- 
"
Man 2,"Could you get another picture of us? 
"
Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
Narrator,"The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"
Cartman,"I'm so fucking bored! 
"
Michael,"Alright, you going next, Ricky? 
"
The Boys,"Help! Somebody! Help us! 
"
Kyle,"It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
"
Stan,"There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
"
Kyle,"Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! 
"
Zipliner,"Zipline!
"
Adults,"Woohoo!
"
Cartman,"We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Me?!
"
Cartman,"Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!""
"
Kyle,"Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
"
Cartman,"I brought it up because you already brought it up!
"
Stan,"That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
"
Kyle,"You fat piece of shit!
"
Cartman,"Fuck you Kyle!
"
Stan,"Guys, guys, does it really matter whose idea it was?!
"
"Cartman, Kyle","Yes!
"
Stan,"Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
"
Narrator,"But what the boys don't realize is that Eric's body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea.  Inside his stomach, bile has just dislodged an Arby's Ultimate Angus. In the average human, this would only cause mild diarrhea.  But Eric Cartman is now drinking Double Dew, a Mountain Dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular Mountain Dew.  His rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste.  The diarrhea shoots out of Eric's anus and into his underwear.  Eric Cartman is a ticking time bomb.
"
Kyle,"DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
"
Cartman,"Nnnn-mo...
"
Stan,"So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
"
Michael,"All right guys, this is where we're going to break for lunch.
"
Guide,"Come in by the waterfall, gang! 
"
Stan,"Oh no, could, could we skip lunch and keep going?
"
Man 2,"Skip a free lunch? Not me! 
"
Guide,"Wo wants sandwiches?  We got ...turkey.  Ham.  Turkey ham. 
"
Pete,"Long story short, we picked up our bags and went to our hotel. 
"
Cartman,"Oogh! Ugh! You guys, seriously! Something's wrong in my tummy! 
"
Kyle,"The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
"
Cartman,"This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
"
Kyle,"You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
"
Cartman,"If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
"
Stan,"Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
"
Michael,"Oh, you mean the little kid with the herpes?
"
Stan,"...Yyyeah.
"
Guide,"That's not herpes, it's a cold sore.
"
Michael,"Right, sorry.
"
Stan,"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
"
Michael,"Jesus, sorry dude, but we're at the summit. The only way down is to zip down.
"
Some adults,"Zipline! Wooo!
"
Guide,"What about the stables?
"
Michael,"Oh yeah, the stables. There's, there's a ranch right past that hill that rents out horses. I, I bet they can get you back.
"
Kyle,"Suddenly, Stan says he knows about some horse stables. Ih it seemed too good to be true.
"
Rancher,"Now let me get this straight: You want four horses, one for each of ya?
"
Stan,"Yea, please!
"
Rancher,"Well I think we can set ya up.
"
Kyle,"Oh, thank God!
"
Stan,"You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
"
Rancher,"Step right out here, we'll get you going.  Got four more for you, Duncan. 
"
Cartman,"NOOO! 
"
Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.
"
Kyle,"AAAAH! 
"
Cartman,"Eeeeugh.
"
Narrator,"Trapped in a tour group on horsback that is only allowed to travel four miles an hour. 
"
Kyle,"Can we please go faster?!
"
Kenny,"(I can't take it!)
"
Duncan,"We got some lunch set up for ya up ahead. Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew.
"
Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAH!
"
Cartman,"Uh oh. 
"
Rider 1,"So anyway, long story short, I was born in 1953 at six in the morning.
"
Narrator,"An attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining""
"
Duncan,"This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls. Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?
"
Rider 2,"Well I certainly would! 
"
Stan,"Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, come on, wake up!
"
Kyle,"Just go. Go without me.
"
Stan,"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan.
"
Stan,"I just sat there, watching Kyle die and... I wanted to tell him the truth right then and there. But then this... fire rose up inside of me, I... I thought ""I can find us a way out!"" I ran off and went searching for, I don't know how long. Twelve minutes? And that's when I found it.
"
Stan,"You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
"
Cartman,"A marina?
"
Stan,"We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
"
Kyle,"What's the point?
"
Stan,"Come on you guys! A boat all to ourselves? It'll be fun! What could possibly go wrong?! 
"
Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  Trapped on a 42-foot powerboat  which is only allowed to go five miles an hour. 
"
Kyle,"Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
"
Cartman,"Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
"
Kyle,"Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
"
Narrator,"The fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape.
"
Cartman,"Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
"
Kenny,"I don't know. I really don't give a shit.
"
Narrator,"For four elementary school boys, an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on... ""I Should Have Never Got On A Goddamn Boat"" 
"
Kyle,"Oh no.  You're not stinking up the entire boat! You're taking a crap off the side into the water!
"
Kenny,"Beavers! 
"
Narrator,"After cleaning Cartman's diarrhea and fighting off beavers, the boys have made a terrifying discovery: that boating is just as boring as ziplining.
"
Stan,"The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
"
Cartman,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
Narrator,"If the boys fall asleep now, from the lack of excitement, they could die. 
"
Kyle,"Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
"
Kyle,"I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
"
Cartman,"I'm not sharing with Kenny. He has herpes!
"
Kenny,"Hey.  Fuck you, Cartman.
"
Narrator,"Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.  And just when it seems it can't get any worse... 
"
Stan,"...Kenny? Kenny! 
"
Narrator,"Kenny McCormick has died of boredom.
"
Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
"
Cartman,"No, not they, YOU! Look what your ziplining idea has done! You killed Kenny, YOU're the bastard!
"
Kyle,"IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
"
Stan,"And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said ""Stop it!""
"
Stan,"Stop it! It was me! My idea.
"
Cartman,"You?!
"
Stan,"Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
"
Kyle,"So you intended for us to go ziplining all along? Why, Stan?!
"
Stan,"If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
"
Kyle,"You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
"
Stan,"I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
"
Cartman,"You... You killed Kenny! 
"
Kyle,"You BAStard! You BAStard, Stan! 
"
Kyle,"How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
"
Stan,"The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
"
Narrator,"But then, miraculously, the boys' prayers are finally answered. 
"
Cartman,"It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
"
Cartman,"You came for us!
"
Kyle,"Mr. Hankey!
"
Stan,"Thank you.  Mr. Hankey. 
"
Mr. Hankey,"Howdy ho, boys? Let's get you back home. 
"
Cartman,"We were saved. It was over.
"
Narrator,"After nearly four hours in the Colorado wilderness, the boys are finally going home. From the boat, the boys were airlifted aboard Mr. Hankey's magical helicrapter.  In the four hours since they had left home, the boys had traveled so far that Mr. Hankey then had to fly them on his Seven Turdy Seven.  From there, it was only an hour ride back home on the Poochoo Express.  Four friends, turn apart by tragedy , would now start the long journey back to forgiveness. Kenny McCormick's remains were finally brought home to his parents.  And the boys received treatment for their herpes. 
"
Cartman,"No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
"
Narrator,"Kyle Broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages. Stan Marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining.  His awareness videos became so popular that Stan once again ended up jacking it in San Diego. As for Eric Cartman,  he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most. In just two weeks, he was back to drinking Diet Double Dew, defiant to dew the math.
"
Cartman,"It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
"
Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!
"
Stan,"What? 
"
Butters,"Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Butters,"Guess!
"
Kyle,"Just tell us, Butters.
"
Butters,"There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
"
Craig,"Oh, we have a new cheerleader?
"
Clyde,"What's she look like?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, what's her name?)
"
Cartman,"Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
"
Butters,"Theh theh, there she is. 
"
Cartman,"Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
"
Token,"Why?! Why are you happy for me?!
"
Cartman,"Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
"
Token,"Nothing! 
"
Cartman,"What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
"
Mr. Garrison,"And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- 
"
Cartman,"Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
"
Kyle,"Will you shut the hell up?! 
"
Cartman,"...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?
"
Token,"No!
"
Cartman,"Huh?
"
Token,"NO.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Token, is there a problem? 
"
Cartman,"Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Everyone pay attention!  Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- 
"
Cartman,"Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.
"
Red,"So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn't invited, so now Stacey's pissed at us.
"
Cartman,"Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
"
Bebe,"Why?!
"
Cartman,"Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
"
Red,"About Token? Why?
"
Cartman,"Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
"
Bebe,"Token likes Nichole?
"
Cartman,"W-yeah, of course. 
"
Red,"Oh yeah, I don't think she has any idea.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
"
Bebe,"Okay.
"
Cartman,"Thanks, you guys.
"
Lola,"One two three four, sorry Bebe.
"
Bebe,"Oh, that's okay.  So, Nichole, guess what? One of the boys here already has a crush on you.
"
"Lola, Jenny, Red, and Wendy","Ohhh.
"
Nichole,"Oh my God, who?
"
Red,"That boy Token.
"
Wendy,"Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. 
"
Nichole,"Oh gee, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.
"
Bebe,"Who? Whowhowhowho?
"
Nichole,"That kid, with the orange coat and the greet hat?
"
Wendy,"Oh, you mean Kyle?
"
Nichole,"Yeah.
"
The Girls,"Oooo, Kyle.
"
Cartman,"WHAT?! KYLE?! 
"
Bebe,"Nichole loves Kyle! Nichole and Kyle sittin' in a tree.
"
The Girls,"K I S S O M G!
"
Nichole,"Haha, shut up you guys! It's just a crush. 
"
Cartman,"Motherfucker! 
"
The Girls,"We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows! 
"
Cartman,"Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
"
Nichole,"Yeah. 
"
Cartman,"Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
"
Nichole,"Oh no, who told you that?
"
Cartman,"Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?
"
Nichole,"Ohhh.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, he's my man. I'm more out than Kyle is, but... it's tough, because he acts like we're not a couple at school because he's embarrassed, but... we get home and he's the best boyfriend I've ever had.
"
Nichole,"Wow, ah I'm sorry. I totally respect that.  Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.
"
Cartman,"Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
"
Nichole,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 
"
Nichole,"Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I'm here.
"
Kyle,"Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
"
Cartman,"Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
"
Butters,"How come?
"
Cartman,"Let's just say that by this time tomorrow, Token and Nichole are gonna be practically married.
"
Butters,"Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
"
Cartman,"No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
"
Butters,"Oh hey, Nichole? Coach wants you to take these to the boys' locker room. 
"
Nichole,"Oh, he does?  Okay.
"
Cartman,"Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
"
Craig,"Where?
"
Jimmy,"Ah I don't see a b- b- Bat-Mobile.
"
Nichole,"Hello??
"
Token,"AAA!
"
Nichole,"OH! Oh gosh I'm so sorry!
"
Token,"Where is everybody? What's goin' on??
"
Nichole,"Coach wanted me to...  I'm sorry. 
"
Kyle,"Hey guys. Guys! Hold up.  Hey uhm, you're kind of friends with that Nichole girl, right?
"
Jenny,"Yyeah.
"
Kyle,"Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
"
Lola,"She likes... movies, cats.
"
Jenny,"She likes basketball.
"
Kyle,"Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
"
Lola,"Well- Hey Kyle,  we were headed over to the mall. You wanna go with us?
"
Kyle,"Oh. Uh, can't right now, but maybe another time. See ya! 
"
Jenny,"Guess he has a crush on Nichole.
"
Lola,"I don't think so. I heard Kyle swings for the same team.
"
Jenny,"Really?
"
Kyle,"It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
"
Token,"Hey! In here! 
"
Nichole,"You think the janitors are still here?
"
Token,"Don't worry. It's gonna be okay. We've got water, and, and maybe somebody even left some food laying around. Come on. 
"
Nichole,"Look!  Somebody left a deli platter.  And board games. And massage oil.
"
Token,"Oh... Good.
"
Nichole,"Well that was sure an interesting night.
"
Token,"It sure was.
"
Nichole,"Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there. That could have been reeeally scary.
"
Token,"Yeah. Now that it's over, I.. I guess it was kind of fun. 
"
Nichole,"Yeahh, it kind of was. Maybe... uh I don't know. Maybe we should get some lunch tomorrow.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, this is sooo cute.
"
Token,"I'd like that.
"
Nichole,"Cool. Well... thanks again. 
"
Cartman,"Ohhhhh my God.
"
Cupid Me,"We did it, Eric. We found in each other a ray of sunshine.
"
Cartman,"You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. 
"
Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee. 
"
Cartman,"I see the questions in your eyes.
I know what's weighing on your mind.
You can be sure I know, my heart.
Girl I'll stand beside you through the years
You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear (I swear) like a shadow that's by your side (Keep it down, girl)
I'll be there
For better or worse (better or worse), till death do us part (death do us part)
I'll love you with every black beat of my heart
And I swear. I swear. I s-we-e-e-ear Yeah, I swear. Straight up. What it do?
"
Cartman,"Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 
"
Stan,"Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
"
Cartman,"I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 
"
Kyle,"You motherfucker! 
"
Cartman,"Kyle, Jesus Christ!
"
Kyle,"What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
"
Cartman,"Oh, heard that through the grapevine, did you?
"
Kyle,"The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
"
Cartman,"Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
"
Kyle,"Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
"
Cartman,"Oh! Oh, I'm a I'm a racist, huh?! I'm a racist! It's how nature works, Kyle! Look! Look, what about Luke Covina and Maria Sanchez?  Is it a coincidence that they ended up together?!
"
Stan,"Actually, I heard they're together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago.
"
Cartman,"Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.
"
Cupid Me,"Teehee, that was us, remember, Eric?
"
Cartman,"Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Cartman,"Nothing.
"
Kyle,"Who is Cupid Me?!
"
Cartman,"Nobody.
"
Kyle,"You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
"
Cartman,"Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
"
Kyle,"God-damnit! 
"
Dad,"Nichole? Your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school.
"
Nichole,"His name is Token. He's really nice.
"
Dad,"Well that's good. But... your mother tells me that this boy is... black.
"
Nichole,"So?
"
Dad,"Well, Nichole, it's just... You know, just because you're black doesn't mean you can only date black boys. It's just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and you're immediately drawn to the one other black person.
"
Mom,"Oh stop, William. There's nothing wrong with her dating a black person.
"
William,"But I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying... she's gonna have to deal with racist people out there! People turning their heads and saying, ""Oh, look at the two black people together. That figures!""
"
Nichole,"It's not like that, Dad. We just happen to like each other. I know it seems like a strange coincidence, but it really is. A coincidence.
"
Mom,"And we are very happy for you, sweetheart. Here, have some more turkey.
"
William,"Yeah, just try the white meat. I know it's a little dry, but... there's a lot more of it.
"
Cartman,"Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
"
Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, heeheehee.
"
Cartman,"Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
"
Cupid Me,"Sorry. 
"
Cartman,"That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
"
Cupid Me,"Heeheeheeheeheehee.
"
Cartman,"Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
"
Cupid Me,"They're fudgey charms of sunshine.
"
Cartman,"You're my fudgey charm of sunshine. Come here, you! 
"
Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teeheeheeheehee. 
"
Cartman,"I'm gonna get you! 
"
Cupid Me,"Heeheehee, no! 
"
Cartman,"I almost got you! Almost! 
"
Liane,"Everything okay, sweetie?
"
Cartman,"Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
"
Nichole,"Oh no...
"
Nichole,"Hey Token.
"
Token,"Hey Nichole.
"
Nichole,"Can I talk to you for a sec?
"
Token,"Sure!  What's up?
"
Nichole,"Listen, I... ugh, I don't think this is gonna work out.
"
Token,"Oh.
"
Nichole,"I'm so sorry. It's just... I don't believe we're really on the same page, you know?
"
Token,"Okay...
"
Nichole,"I think you're really great... Ww-we just...
"
Token,"I think, you're really great.
"
Nichole,"...I'm sorry.
"
Token,"Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'll see you around. 
"
Nichole,"Okay. 
"
Cartman,"It's not fair! They were so... happy!
"
Butters,"It's gonna be okay, Eric.
"
Cartman,"It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
"
Butters,"They'll find love somewhere else.
"
Cartman,"No, they won't!
"
Butters,"Yes, they will.
"
Cartman,"No, they won't! Fuck you Butters, you're an asshole!
"
Cupid Me,"Teeheehee. Looks like somebody could use a little arrow of sunshine.
"
Cartman,"And you! I should never have believed in you!
"
Butters,"In...in who, Eric?
"
Cartman,"I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
"
Kyle,"Hey man. You okay?
"
Token,"Yeah.
"
Kyle,"What happened? It just didn't work out?
"
Token,"Yeah I guess.
"
Kyle,"So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
"
Token,"Yeah.
"
Kyle,"So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
"
Token,"Yeah, we're through.
"
Kyle,"Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
"
Token,"I'm sorry Kyle. I like girls. 
"
Kyle,"Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?
"
Announcer,"We'll be back with more of the Jeffersons right after this.
"
Man,"I work hard, so I need a laxative that works hard too!  I can't be constipated on the job.  That's why I need... Soft Serve.  Because when I'm constipated, sometimes even a hard push isn't enough.  Don't give up. Get back in there and get to work!  'Cause when the going gets tough, the tough gets going!
"
Cartman,"That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
"
Cupid Me,"No, you don't.
"
Cartman,"Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
"
Cupid Me,"No, you don't. 
"
Cartman,"Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 
"
Cupid Me,"Teehee, stop it.
"
Cartman,"Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
"
Cupid Me,"Heeheehee, heeheeheehee,  Heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee.
"
Cartman,"Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
"
William,"I'm sorry, but she's at the Denver Nuggets game.
"
Cartman,"Denver Nuggets game?
"
William,"Yeah, she went with a nice white, Jewish boy.
"
Cartman,"NOOOOOOO! 
"
Announcer,"Welcome to today's matchup between the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Clippers.  And now, here to sing the National Anthem, country music star Brad Paisley. 
"
Brad Paisley,"O! say can you see by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars-
"
Cartman,"Nooooooo!
"
Announcer,"Nuggets fans, please direct your attention to center court and the president of Halitosis Kidz. , who invite you to join the Denver Nuggets in the fight against morbid halitosis in children.  Here to attempt a three-point shot for adolescents with terminally bad breath is  the poster child for Halitosis Kidz, Stacy Muleburg.  And a good try. 
"
Stacy,"Aaahahahaaaa.
"
Adults,"Awww! 
"
Cartman,"NOOOOOOO. 
"
Guard,"Tickets please.
"
Cartman,"No time! NOOOOOOO!
"
Announcer,"We're all set for the tipoff. 
"
Cartman,"Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
"
Crowd,"Awwwww. 
"
Cartman,"I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
"
Brad,"I swear, Kyle.
"
Cartman,"I swear, Kyle. 
"
Nichole,"Where are you going?
"
Kyle,"That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
"
Nichole,"He did that? Oh no.
"
Cartman,"Thank you! Thank you all. That's all I wanted to say. That and... The Bat-Mobile's outside.  Seriously guys, you gotta see it. The Bat-Mobile! It's outside.
"
Spectator,"What? 
"
Nichole,"Token. Hey.
"
Token,"Hi.
"
Nichole,"Token, I'm so sorry. I thought you were only with me because I'm black.
"
Token,"I'm sorry too. I wouldn't even talk to you at first because you were black. 
"
Both,"Do you think we could... Do you still want to... 
"
Nichole,"Maybe we can give it another try?
"
Token,"There are still people who will look at us funny. That think we're supposed to be together.
"
Nichole,"Let them look. I don't care.
"
Token,"I don't care, either. 
"
Nichole,"I just think you're a great person. The color of your skin doesn't matter.
"
Token,"YAY! 
"
Cartman,"Oh my gohhhd, so cute! 
"
Cupid Me,"Teeheehee, a place for everything, and everything in its place.
"
Cartman,"That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
"
Cupid Me,"That's right, and I found somebody who's just the same as you!
"
Cartman,"Really?!
"
Cupid Me,"There she is! 
"
Cartman,"What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!
"
Cupid Me,"Teeheeheeheehee, fuck you! 
"
Cartman,"Hey, stop it!
"
Stacy,"Haaagh! 
"
Cartman,"Nooo!
"
Stacy,"Haahahaagh!
"
Dan,"Artonius Jackson catches the ball , he's running down the sideline-  Ohhhh!
"
Randy,"BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
"
Dan,"Jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up. 
"
Randy,"That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
"
Commentator,"Yeah, Jackson took a real shot and...  well I'm not sure what he's doing now, but uh, it appears as if he's looking for his keys, Dan.
"
Dan,"Yeah, and that doesn't make a lot of sense, because ever since his concussion in '06, he doesn't even have a license.
"
Commentator,"Coach Martin is coming over to tell him that now, but Jackson appears to think he's in a car driving home. 
"
Dan,"Well, during this time out we're happy to be joined by the commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Commissioner, a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the NFL. How's the league handling all that?
"
Goodell,"Well, there certainly are interesting statistics coming out, Dan, and we are deeply concerned, anduh and waiting to see if there's... really any direct correlation between football and head trauma.
"
Dan,"Oh, and it looks like some of the MFL alumni are takin' the field now. There's All-Pro safety Martin Gregors , and fullback Jim Harris. Looks like his pants are down around his ankles. 
"
Commentator,"Somebody should let him know. Oh, and Old Surehand Mike Tafthill , who seems to be baking an imaginary cake, Dan.
"
Dan,"Yeah, not sure if that's meant to be a cake or, or perhaps a, a loaf of bread, but he definitely thinks he's baking something.
"
Butters,"Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
"
Stan,"You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
"
Butters,"That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
"
Cartman,"That's right, Butters.
"
Dan,"And with that the Browns are ready to kick it off back to the Broncos
"
Randy,"All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
"
Kyle,"We don't have kickoffs anymore. 
"
Randy,"Huh?
"
Stan,"The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
"
Randy,"Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
"
Principal Victoria,"Okay, before we get started with this PTA meeting, does anyone have any outstanding issues?
"
Randy,"Yeah, I'd like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, yes, we've decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions, m'kay?
"
Randy,"Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
"
Mr. Adler,"Bras?
"
Randy,"Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
"
Linda,"How would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer?
"
Randy,"Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Huh. You you think the students would like that?
"
Randy,"Oh they'd love it! A sport where safety is all that matters? How about we call it ""sarcastaball""?!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?
"
Randy,"Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
"
Stan,"Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
"
Randy,"Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 
"
Butters,"I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
"
Randy,"Oh, you know, try to get it into the end zone, but be really polite about it.
"
Butters,"Okay! Hey, hey, heh excuse me. Pardon me. Heh,  you guys look terrific. Wow, this game is great!
"
Principal Victoria,"How's it going, coach?
"
Randy,"How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
"
Principal Victoria,"So you're happy with these changes?
"
Randy,"Happy? I'm thrilled! Look at how much better this is!
"
Principal Victoria,"Okay. 
"
Anchor,"Is football safe for your kids? Concerned Parent Randy Marsh says ""No,"" and has started a movement to reform the sport, gathering followers by the hundreds.
"
Randy,"Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
"
Anchor,"Showing just how much one concerned parent can do, Marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of Washington.
"
Randy,"Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 
"
Kyle,"This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
"
Clyde,"I can't even remember if we're supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him. I'm so confused.
"
Stan,"This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, you know what?  Screw this!
"
Butters,"Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
"
Kyle,"We don't even understand how this game is played.
"
Butters,"This great game isn't about plays. It's about sportsmanship. And compassion. And when I look around this locker room, well I see some of the nicest, most compassionate guys I've ever met!  Well Token, you're nicer than anybody I know.  And Clyde! Well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field!
"
Cartman,"That's true.
"
Butters,"Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
"
"Clyde, Kenny","Yeah.
"
Butters,"And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!
"
Boys,"Yeah!
"
Butters,"And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
"
Boys,"Yeah! Yeah!
"
Cartman,"Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.
"
Goodell,"As commissioner of the NFL, I am so thrilled to see our nation's youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football. Oh, but why stop there? Since football is so barbaric, we should change too. So let's give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the Denver Broncos, Randy Marsh.  Congratulations, Marsh. Good job!
"
Randy,"Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
"
Goodell,"Nice going!
"
Randy,"Yeah, no, you nice going! 
"
Photographer,"Hey guys, how about a nice fucking picture to welcome in the future of sports? 
"
Announcer,"Welcome to the inaugural game of the National Sarcastaball League! As we bring you today's matchup between the Denver Broncos and the Oakland Raiders.
"
Randy,"Yeah, lookin' good, guys! Let's kick some butt! 
"
Randy,"Oh yeah, good one! 
"
Announcer,"And now, here are your Denver Whoop de fucking do girls!
"
Cheerleaders,"Woo! Woo!
"
Cheerleader 1,"Go Broncos! Go!
"
Cheerleader 2,"Whoop de fuckin' do!
"
Announcer,"And now, here to sing the sarcastaball anthem, recording artist, Cee-Lo!
"
Cee Lo Green,"I love sarcastaball
It's so much better than football
I'm so glad they got rid of violence in sports
'Cause sarcastaball is so super fun to watch
"
Fan 1,"Woo! Nice job, Cee-Lo! Good to see you on TV some more!
"
Fan 2,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of all your hit songs!
"
Kyle,"Dude, what do you mean ""We don't have a coach.""?
"
Stan,"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
"
Kyle,"But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
"
Stan,"I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
"
Clyde,"Well, we might as well call up Lakewood and tell 'em we forfeit. 
"
Kyle,"We can't.
"
Clyde,"We don't have a coach, Kyle.
"
Cartman,"Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Craig,"Hey yeah.
"
Stan,"The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
"
Butters,"Oh jeez n-no, I I don't know, fellas.
"
Cartman,"Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
"
Butters,"Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
"
Stan,"Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
"
Butters,"'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 
"
Kyle,"We need you, Butters. You're the man! 
"
The Team,"Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters! Bu-tters!
"
Fangirls,"Butters, rah, Butters!
"
A Fangirl,"I love you, Butters!
"
Butters,"I love you too, ladies. 
"
Wendy,"Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.
"
Red,"Leave him alone, Wendy! He's mine! 
"
Butters,"Woohoohoohoohoo!
"
Butters,"Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
"
Stephen,"Oh. Well uh, that's okay Butters. Remember what we talked about. Sometimes our happy, creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night.
"
Butters,"I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
"
Stephen,"All right Butters, let's... it's happy feelings, let's just not talk about it.
"
Butters,"Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. 
"
Announcer,"The score is zero to zero as the Steelers kick off to the Broncos.
"
Cheerleader 1,"Go Broncos, Go.
"
Dan,"Manning has the ball. He's saying some really great things about the other team. Manning met by LaMarr Woodley. He's giving the balloon to Woodley. The referee comes in.  Oh, the referee is calling that a touchdown! Oh wait, now another official is signalling that's a safety!
"
Randy,"Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!
"
Dan,"They're gonna have to sort this one out with a side judge. 
"
Side Judge,"Fuck it, it's a fucking field goal!
"
Randy,"YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!
"
Reporter 1,"Coach, three to nothing victory over the Steelers. You must feel like a reeeal winner.
"
Randy,"Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 
"
Reporter 1,"Coach Belichick says,  ""No way we can beat the Broncos. They've had the same coach for almost a day.""
"
Randy,"Oh yeah, I'm just the guy who invented sarcastaball! There's no way I'd know how to coach it!
"
Reporter 2,"Guess we'll find out on Sunday.
"
Randy,"...Yeah... 
"
Randy,"All right guys, listen up! Forget about the day off, we need to practice tomorrow.
"
Broncos,"D'awwwww!
"
Manning,"Practice on Monday after a victory? Great!
"
Randy,"That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
"
Manning,"Practice on Monday? That's just what I wanna do!
"
Randy,"That's IT! 
"
Cartman,"Hey Butters, you got a minute?
"
Butters,"Wuh sure, Eric. 
"
Cartman,"I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
"
Butters,"Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
"
Cartman,"No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
"
Butters,"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
"
Cartman,"...I don't have a dad.
"
Butters,"...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
"
Cartman,"Youuu save it all?
"
Butters,"My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
"
Cartman,"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
"
Butters,"I don't know. Weh I never really thought of it that way. 
"
Cartman,"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
"
Butters,"Do you feel warm and compassionate?
"
Cartman,"Holy shit I think I do.
"
Jim Rome,"Welcome back to Rome. We're gonna talk some sarcastaball. I can't wait. I can't wait to talk sarcastaball because it's really compelling.  Joining me now is the coach of the Denver Broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball, Randy Marsh. Thanks for calling in, Randy. Really happy to have you on the show.
"
Randy,"Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
"
Jim Rome,"Randy, first off, thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare. Way to go.
"
Randy,"Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
"
Jim Rome,"Well it certainly makes for an exciting game. How about last night's nail-biter that ended zero to zero? That's a game I wanna watch twice. That's a game I wanna watch four times. Check that: I'll watch that game... five times.  Good luck on Sunday. I'm sure that'll be another game that I could watch... twelve times. Check that: thirteen times.
"
Randy,"Thanks Jim. 
"
Sharon,"Randy, aren't you gonna come join your family for dinner?
"
Randy,"Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
"
Sharon,"Randy, something's happened. Are you un-able to stop being sarcastic?
"
Randy,"Oh, right! I can't stop being sarcastic now!
"
Sharon,"I'm telling you, Randy, I think this sport is doing something to your brain.
"
Randy,"Right, it's doing something to my brain! And now I can't stop being sarcastic!
"
Sharon,"Do you mean that?
"
Randy,"Yes! I totally mean it!  Help me, Sharon. Help me.
"
Butters,"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
"
Spectators,"Awwwwww!
"
Stan,"Cartman, you idiot!
"
Butters,"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
"
Cartman,"That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
"
Clyde,"Yeah. We need more of your mojo, Butters.
"
Butters,"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
"
Doctor,"Uh hum. Mmm.  I'm sorry, Mr. Marsh, but there appears to be permanent damage.
"
Randy,"Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
"
Sharon,"How do we fix this, doctor?
"
Doctor,"You don't. I'm sorry, there... just isn't enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain.
"
Randy,"So that's it.  I should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me. Let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too! 
"
Doctor,"Ohh, rreally? You, you think there's a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball?  Really?  That's fascinating. Please, go on.
"
Randy,"No, sarcastaball has nothing to do with it. I just... I just really enjoy being sarcastic and so I must be finding an excuse.
"
Doctor,"You know, I have a 50-year-old Alzheimer's patient out in the waiting room who can't even remember his family, but... let's forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging people's brains.
"
Randy,"My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
"
Doctor,"Okay, well I've got a better idea. Let's get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases, let's, let's take all that money and make commercials that say ""Hey America, sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain.""
"
Randy,"Thank you, doctor. Thank you so much! 
"
Jim Rome,"Jim Rome here. Hey, I love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's so thrilling I need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game. That's when I reach for a bottle of this.  Butters' Creamy Goo. 
"
Voice-Over,"You play hard. You need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost.  Sports these days are all about being nice, so take your game to the next level . With Butters' Creamy Goo.  You'll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine. 
"
Butters,"Like me!
"
Jim Rome,"Get with it, and get the Goo!
"
Voice-Over,"Butters' Creamy Goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs. Commitment! Compassion! And Comradery! And now it's available in quart size!
"
Singer,"Go and chug a bottle of Butters' Creamy Goo!
"
Voice-Over,"Best served just above room temperature.
"
Butters,"42! Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT!  Oh no, that kid's gonna intercept it!  Good job, kid! 
"
Randy,"STAN?! Stan! 
"
Stan,"Dad?
"
Randy,"Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Sharon,"We're sorry, Stanley, we don't want you playing this sport anymore.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Hey, get off the field! M'kay?! 
"
Randy,"Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!
"
Sharon,"Stanley, just get your things and come on. We're going home!
"
Stan,"Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
"
Randy,"Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
"
Sharon,"Don't you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?
"
Stan,"Oh right, like he doesn't exaggerate every disease he gets!
"
Sharon,"Ohohh Randy, it's happening! 
"
Butters,"Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
"
Randy,"Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
"
Stan,"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere?
"
Randy,"I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
"
Cartman,"That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
"
Stan,"Yeah Dad. You need some of this. 
"
Randy,"... This is cum. 
"
Stephen,"And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you've done!  Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn't mean YOU need to take it to ""Oh, who don't we just drink each other's cum?""! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!
"
Butters,"What's sarcasm and what's com?
"
Stephen,"We'll talk about that when you're older!
"
Randy,"Come on everybody. Let's work on that kickoff change and get back to some football. 
"
Jim Rome,"Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein' sarcastic. That kid's probably grounded for a month. Check that: I'm sure he's grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don't we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that's a fastball right there. That's a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don't know what else to say but ""So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin' you."" Let's just hope nothin' like this ever happens again. Probably won't. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days.
"
Butters,"DAD! Hey Dad!
"
Stephen,"What?!
"
Butters,"My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
"
Stephen,"Oh, well, Butters, that's just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It's pointing up because Jesus is your friend.
"
Butters,"Thanks, Dad.
"
Stan,"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
"
Kyle,"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
"
Cartman,"I'm not fat, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Right, you're not fat.
"
Cartman,"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
"
Stan,"Whoa duude!
"
Kyle,"Jesus Christ, you can't even walk down an aisle to get your candy? 
"
Obese Man,"Excuse me.  Excuse me! 
"
Cartman,"See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
"
Kyle,"Why do they even allow those things in stored?
"
Stan,"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
"
Kyle,"You've gotta be kidding me!
"
Cartman,"Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
"
Kyle,"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
"
Obese Lady,"Are those Candy Corn Oreos?
"
Cartman,"Yeah... Yeah, here you go. 
"
Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
"
Kyle,"Why? 
"
Cartman,"I've been... doing a lot of thinking... about what you said at Wall-Mart.  You're right Kyle. I'm fat.  All these years you tell me and me saying ""No, I'm big-boned"" or ""no, that's just muscle""... It was always just me living in denial. I'm fucking fat, Kyle. I'm fucking fat as fucking fuck.
"
Kyle,"Cartman, uh, all I was trying to tell you at Wall-Mart was that you-
"
Cartman,"No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
"
Kyle,"Oh no!
"
Cartman,"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
"
Kyle,"You don't need that! Get off of it.
"
Cartman,"Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
"
Kyle,"That's not what I meant by doing something about it, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
"
Kyle,"What??
"
Cartman,"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
"
Kyle,"So take a shit somewhere else!
"
Cartman,"That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.
"
Gerald,"What's going on down here?
"
Cartman,"Can't seem to be able to take a dump in your house, Mr. Broflovski. Doesn't appear to be handicap-accessible.  I'll look past it this time, but you'd better get that bathroom up to code of you don't want a lawsuit.  Well, I'm off to go try to take a shit at Best Buy, guys. See you, Kyle. 
"
Cartman,"Out of the way. Out of the way please. 
"
Greeter,"Uhh I guess take that big booth by the window. 
"
Ticket Teller,"Okay, we're finally gonna start with pre-boarding. Anyone needing special assistance getting on the aircraft- Oh...
"
Cartman,"Coming through. Oh how humiliating.  Scuse me. Gotta go to the front of the line. Oh what shame I feel.  Oh jeez, look how fat I am. I'm just mortified, you guys. Can't believe I have-  Ay! The fuck is this?! There's a wait for the Rascal line?! He-hay! That kid in the middle isn't even fat! Look at him! He's got no right to be on a Rascal! You're not fooling anybody asshole! Walk to the back of the line!
"
Legless Boy,"I don't have legs.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, well you got skinny arms!  'Scuse me. Move it.
"
Cartman,"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
"
Anchor,"More lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo. Property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms, costing taxpayers millions. Opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of Rascal tipping.
"
Obese Man 2,"Stop it you kids! sto- Oop- Owww. Weak! Weak!
"
Anchor,"The government warns that Rascal tipping can be dangerous, and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor. To counter the crisis, the Department of Health has called for $25 million in aid, so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device. 
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
"
Kyle,"You have got to be kidding me!
"
Cartman,"What, Kyle?! 
"
Kyle,"We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
"
Cartman,"You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
"
Kyle,"So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
"
Cartman,"Oh! Oh, did you hear him?!  This is exactly what Adele is talking about!  Our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we don't have slim stomachs and perky little tits like Kyle!  Well I for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because Kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day  to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers!  You should be ashamed of YOURself, Kyle! eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look!  I'm not feeling shamed anymore! From now on, I'm gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high! Just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesn't mean they're an ignorant piece of white trash, Kyle! I may be fat, but I'm not Honey Boo Boo!
"
Kyle,"Who's Honey Boo Boo?
"
Stan,"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
"
Honey Boo Boo,"My name's Honey Boo Boo and I'm a beauty queen, bitches.  I'm fat as a whale and I don't give two shits, girl!
"
Mama,"Her favorite foods are sketti and butter, and she likes drinkin' Red Bull and Mountain Dew.
"
Honey Boo Boo,"I'm only six and I've already had three heart attacks, girlfriend!
"
Mama,"Come on! Come on now, Boo Boo!  Now get up and wave to them judges!  We ain't got no shame about our weight, 'cause our weight makes us sassy. 
"
Kyle,"Jesus, dude. W-w-what happened? It's like, something's lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore.
"
Stan,"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
"
James Cameron,"This is it! Throttle down!
"
A crewman,"Throttle down! 
"
Crewman 1,"Mr. Cameron, you don't have to do this! Why don't you just go back to your house in Malibu? Go work on another movie?
"
James Cameron,"I have to do this! I have to try and raise it!
"
Crewman 1,"The bar isn't something that actually lowers, Mr. Cameron.
"
James Cameron,"Then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters?  How do YOU account for... Honey Boo Boo? The bar has been lowered to depths we can't even fathom. If anyone can go down there and raise it back, it's ME.  Let her go!  UV lights on. Pressure system is normal. Music, on.
"
Singers,"His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.
"
James Cameron,"Systems are normal. You guys hearing the song okay up there?
"
Singers,"James (James) Cameron, explorer of the sea
"
Crewman 1,"Yes, James, we hear the song.
"
James Cameron,"Descending to one thousand feet. I don't see the bar yet. Looks like it must have sunk pretty low.
"
Singers,"With a dying thirst to be the first. Could it be? Yeah it's him. James Cameron.
"
Kyle,"Come on, hurry it up in there! 
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
"
Kyle,"This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
"
Token,"Yeah, what we need is something to raise awareness.
"
Kyle,"Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
"
Token,"Something like... a documentary. You know, follow Cartman around, with a video camera, and then get all his bullshit on television.
"
Kyle,"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
"
Token,"At least then we'd be voicing our concern. I mean, if you think about it, we should feel some shame for... complaining about it and not doing anything.
"
Kyle,"You, I gu-I guess you're kinda right.
"
Token,"Hey, tell you what: if you wanna follow Cartman around, and get a video of him, I'll pay to make it into a documentary, and get it on the air.
"
Kyle,"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
"
Craig,"Hey Token. If you're gonna get Kyle to video that stuff for you, you should probably tell him the truth.
"
Token,"He doesn't need to know the truth. Kyle will get what he wants, and so will I. 
"
Kyle,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
"
Token,"He's chubby,  he's filthy , and he's just a little bit nuts.  Here he is, America's newest sweetheart, Fatty Doo Doo! 
"
Kyle,"Fatty Doo Doo?
"
Randy Newman,"Who's that scootin' on a scooter? Fatty Doo Doo
Who's got doodoo like a fatty scoop de do?
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Randy Newman,"Nobody scoots a fatty doo like you do.
Scatty foo foo
Patty poo poo
White president, black president, I don't care.
Just scoop me up some doodoo and I'll be right there.
I. Only. Know. Five. Chords. Six-
"
Token,"Come in.
"
Kyle,"What have you done?
"
Token,"I helped you make a documentary, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
"
Token,"Kyle, Kyle, I'm trying to make compelling television.
"
Kyle,"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
"
Token,"I can remember... exactly where I was... the first time I saw Honey Boo Boo. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. A shameful, fat family eating white trash food to their death. And then I saw what network it was on: The Learning Channel.  If they can feel okay about that, why can't I?
"
Kyle,"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
"
Token,"But she's not black, Kyle. She's white.  The bar is determined by society, Kyle. And it's not something that can just be raised up.  Not by us, or anyone else.
"
James Cameron,"You guys seeing this?!
"
Crewman 1,"Yes, we see, Mr. Cameron.
"
James Cameron,"This is where the bar was just a few years ago. It was lowered here when President Clinton got a blow job in the oval office. And suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they weren't all that bad. But clearly something else has lowered the bar even more! I must go deeper! We're in the pipe, five by five.
"
Kyle,"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
"
Stan,"I guess not, but... What is it exactly you're trying to do?
"
Kyle,"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
"
Stan,"Dude! Dude, not cool!
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Stan,"Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
"
Kyle,"What? Oh my God.
"
Stan,"Yeah dude. It's really serious.
"
Mama,"Well, the doctor said Honey Boo Boo needs a heart transplant. They're gonna do a surgery and put a pig heart in her, so, we're going to the ranch to pick out a hog.
"
Honey Boo Boo,"I'mm gettin' a piiig heaaart.
"
Mama,"Honey Boo Boo is gonna do pageants with a pig heart, we wanna pick a hog that has pizzazz and knows how to work it, girl!
"
Honey Boo Boo,"I waunt that one!
"
Farmer,"This one here?  You want this one??
"
Honey Boo Boo,"Yeah! No wait! That pig over there gave me the evil eye! I wuant that one! I waunt  that one!
"
Farmer,"This one?  this one right here?? Ya waunt this one??
"
Honey Boo Boo,"I want that one's heart! It looked at me funny!
"
Mama,"We've been in the OR about two hours already. I just hope when she does her pageants the judges don't take away points 'cause she's got a pig heart.  Honey Boo Boo!  Honey BOO BOO!
"
Honey Boo Boo,"What?!
"
Mama,"What you gonna tell them judges if they ask you about your heart?
"
Honey Boo Boo,"I'm gonna tell them ""my heart is sweeter than bacon, child!"" 
"
Mama,"Who waunts sketti and butter?  She got a pig heart an' now she thinks she's a pachyderm. Show 'em your scar!
"
Honey Boo Boo,"This is myyy scaaar 'cause I got a pig heart. My scar makes me sassy, child! 
"
James Cameron,"S. S. Cameron? This is James Cameron. I am now at... 16,000 feet. You should see the cold darkness of it all. The isolation and yet awwwe of the sea's magnitude. I have now sunk deeper than any human has ever been before! 
"
Randy Newman,"We are here in the ocean depths goin' deep deep deep-  Oh hey James Cameron.
"
James Cameron,"What the fuck?!
"
Randy Newman,"I've been divin' in the deep and I'm feelin' so cheap.
"
James Cameron,"You son of a bitch Newman! How did you beat me down here!
"
Randy Newman,"I don't want anyone raisin' the bar, 'cause nobody'll hire me! Deep deep deep in the ocean. Ohhh, come on. Fight me, Cameron.
"
James Cameron,"Alright, you son of a bitch! I'll take you to hell! 
"
Cartman,"It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
"
Cartman,"Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
"
Token,"It actually aired last night.
"
Kyle,"You found a network to buy it?
"
Token,"Yeah, but don't worry. It didn't do so good. We got killed in the ratings by Honey Boo Boo.
"
Cartman,"What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
"
Token,"Well it was only our first show of the season, so you really can't-
"
Cartman,"I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
"
Announcer,"We welcome you to the First Lady's Symposium on Obesity, with your keynote speaker, Michelle Obama. 
"
Michelle Obama,"Our country is in the midst of an epidemic. Recently a very big conflict was brought to my attention.  A conflict that illustrates without a doubt what should be our nation's number one priority. What will we do as a country? I cannot give you any easy answers. But what I can give you, is what we've all been waiting for! Honey Boo Boo versus Fatty Poo Poo! 
"
Cartman,"You're goin' down, bitch!  Nobody takes my ratings!
"
Token,"That's good, Fatty, get pissed!
"
Cartman,"I'm pissed!
"
Token,"Yeah, Fatty!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
"
Mama,"Ain't nobody can beat my Boo Boo at sketti wrestlin'! 
"
Michelle Obama,"Let's do this! 
"
Honey Boo Boo,"Ow!
"
Cartman,"I ain't done with you, bitch!
"
Man,"Yeah! Tip assist!
"
Crewman 2,"You think he's dead? 
"
Crewman 3,"I hope so.
"
James Cameron,"S.S. Cameron! This is James Cameron! I've found it! My God I found the bar!  Divert all power to sub systems! Two percent oxygen left!  The bar is too heavy! Aaaaagh! Come on you bitch!
"
Crewman 4,"Well I'll be damned.
"
Stan,"Dude, you okay? 
"
Kyle,"I've been thinking, how did shamelessness get to this?  Did it start with fat people on scooters? Or did the bar get lowered way before that? And then I started thinking, maybe it was us.  I don't know, but maybe somehow, we lowered the bar, a long time ago.  And now we're all sittin' here in the stink of it all.  There's no going back, Stan. 
"
Man 2,"Rrrgh it's like, I can't explain it. I just suddenly feel like this isn't right. 
"
Man 3,"I don't know why we were watchin' that garbage in the first place. 
"
Kyle,"Huh?
"
Aide,"Ms. Obama, are you, uh, ma'am? Are you okay?
"
Michelle Obama,"Something's wrong. This... This is all wrong!  Stop! Everyone! What are we doing?! How can you let this happen to your daughter?!
"
Mama,"I don't know, I... How did I let myself go like this? What have I done??
"
Man 4,"When did we devolve into watching fat kids sketti wrestling?
"
Michelle Obama,"We need to realize obesity is an epidemic. But it's not a disease. From now on I'm going to dedicate this administration to FIGHTING childhood obesity! 
"
Cartman,"Oh! You fucking bitch! 
"
Token,"What the hell is going on?
"
Kyle,"I don't know. I think... we've been given another chance.
"
Crewman 5,"Hey Cameron, we can't believe it.
"
James Cameron,"We're done here! Set course for the set of Avatar 2
"
Crewman 6,"Mr. Cameron.  People should know. How you saved us all? How you raised the bar? How will they know what a hero you are?
"
James Cameron,"James Cameron doesn't do what James Cameron does for James Cameron.  James Cameron does what James Cameron does because James Cameron is... James Cameron. 
"
Singers,"His name is James (James) Cameron, the bravest pioneer.
No budget too steep no sea too deep Who's that? It's him!
James Cameron.
"
Announcer,"Erectile dysfunction is a fact of life. You want to show her you love her, but you're old, and so is she.  The next time that special moment comes, don't let your sex drive fail you just because your wife looks like a shriveled prune. Fake it, with Cialis.  It won't make her any harder, but it will make you not care for up to three hours.  And then you can still have your own separate bathrub from her later on. 
"
Gerald,"Hey Sheila. You feel like having some fun?
"
Sheila,"Oh dear, did the Cialis commercial turn you on again?
"
Gerald,"How about I put on the uniform?
"
Sheila,"Oh, Gerald...
"
Gerald,"Huh? What do you think? You know you like it.
"
Sheila,"Oh, hello. 
"
Gerald,"UPS man. I have a ...package from Amazon for you.
"
Sheila,"Oh, dear, but I'm barely dressed.
"
Gerald,"If you'll just...  sign right here. 
"
Sheila,"Oh, you're so rough with me, Mr. UPS man!
"
Gerald,"Yeah?  Do you like your package, ma'am? 
"
Sheila,"Oh yes!
"
Gerald,"Huh? 
"
Sheila,"Do it harder, UPS man!
"
Kyle,"Ike, what's the matter?  Dude, you've been in here crying all morning. What's going on?  Oh. My. God. Ike, a-are you sure about this?
"
Ike,"Yes! Yes!
"
Kyle,"I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
"
Ike,"I saw them, Kyle, I saw them!
"
Kyle,"Oh no...
"
Kyle,"You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
"
Stan,"Dude, what happened?
"
Kyle,"Take a look. 
"
Stan,"What's this? 
"
Kyle,"Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
"
Stan,"Whoa!
"
Cartman,"Dude, no way!
"
Kyle,"Yeah dude. 
"
Stan,"But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex? 
"
Kyle,"Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
"
Randy,"Ohhhh... 
"
Stan,"Well are you gonna tell your dad?
"
Kyle,"I don't know. I feel like I should confront my mom first. But it's so embarrassing.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Cartman,"Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
"
Stan,"Cartman dude, not now.
"
Cartman,"No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
"
Randy,"Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
"
Jimbo,"How do you tell him? ""Hey Gerald, Sorry, but the UPS man is bangin' your wife."" It's really none of our business.
"
Stuart,"If my wife was having sex with the UPS man, I'd want you guys to tell me!
"
Stephen,"How do you know she's not? I mean, think about it: this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day, who clearly has a kind of... insatiable lust... I mean, somebody who would have sex with Kyle's mom would have sex with just about anything!
"
Randy,"Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
"
Mechanic,"Wouldn't be the first time.  Hyeah, there's a price to be paid with having things convenient. Used to be... a man had to go to the store to buy himself a pitcher of milk. Hyeah, but men got lazy. They wanted that milk delivered right to the door. Only problem was, the guy deliverin' that milk end sup fuckin' your wife. Sure, you had your nice cold milk delivered right to your doorstep, but your wife was gettin' pounded out like a mallard duck.  And now you got your Amazon.  And the milkman's come back.  And none of ya are safe. 
"
Security Agent,"And so you'd need the motion detectors in the living room and the kitchen, the touch pads at the front and rear doors, and break-in monitors on all windows. I'm afraid those are not secure at all.
"
Cartman,"Oh no, really?
"
Liane,"Oh, I'm sorry, but I really don't think I can afford this.
"
Cartman,"Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
"
Liane,"Ohhh...
"
Security Agent,"Yes, unfortunately it's not enough to just be fearful of strangers these days.
"
Cartman,"What-what do you mean?
"
Security Agent,"Well, many times, houses are burglarized by someone the victim knows.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, I knew it! Kyle is always taking my stuff! Just yesterday I couldn't find my iPod headphones! That sneaky little Jew!
"
Security Agent,"We realize that's a lot of money, Mrs. Cartman, but really, how much is feeling secure in your own home worth?
"
Cartman,"Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
"
Sharon,"Don't you need to be getting to work, Rand?
"
Randy,"No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 
"
UPS Man,"Hey there, looks like I got a couple of packagers from Amazon for ya.
"
Randy,"Oh, is that so?
"
UPS Man,"If I can just get your signature right  there?
"
Randy,"Sure um... Chad, is it?
"
UPS Man,"Thad.
"
Randy,"Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
"
UPS Man,"Oh you know, just, tryin' to get to everyone.
"
Randy,"Yeah I'll bet. 
"
UPS Man,"Well, have a good one.
"
Randy,"Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.
"
Sharon,"Ooooo, stuff from Amazon?
"
Randy,"Yeah, w-what are they?
"
Sharon,"You know, to be honest, I can't remember?
"
Randy,"You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
"
Sharon,"Ohhh yeahyeahyeah, these are the paring knives I ordered. Sorry, I think I was a little tipsy.  oh, and this is the book Stan's been wanting; can you take it up to him?
"
Randy,"Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 
"
Randy,"Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
"
Cartman,"Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?
"
Jeff,"This is Jeff with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
"
Cartman,"Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
"
Jeff,"That's okay. Do you have your security pass phrase you can tell me?
"
Cartman,"Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
"
Jeff,"Okay, I've got something a little different here.
"
Cartman,"Uhhh, it is My friend Kyle is a no-good dirty...? Hang on, I've got it written down here somewhere.
"
Jeff,"No problem.
"
Cartman,"Sorry about this.
"
Jeff,"It's all right, it happens all the time.
"
Cartman,"'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
"
Jeff,"You want to rape your mom?
"
Cartman,"That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
"
Jeff,"You said you lived there.
"
Cartman,"I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
"
Randy,"How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?
"
Mechanic,"There's no getting rid of him. Not in any you folks would be prepared for. Noh, best you just let him go on fucking your wives. Maybe he'll get tired of it.
"
Stephen,"Damn you, it's not just our wives anymore!  This morning, he came for me. I opened the door. It was the UPS man. He had a box from Amazon. I looked inside and found an adapter for an iPhone and then I remembered: I had ordered it! I ordered it the day before and I had barely any recollection. The UPS man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now.
"
Randy,"You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
"
Mechanic,"We used a pretty blonde to lure him in. When she answered the door she told the milkman to follow her to the bathrub. She took off her clothes and... asked the milkman to fill the tub with milk. The milkman said, ""You want that milk pasteurize?"" And the blonde replied, ""No, just up to my boobs. I can splash it in my eyes."" That's when we jumped 'im. It was over in minutes. Then we burned his body. You wanna get rid of the milkman? You gotta kill him and kill him good. And then you gotta go to the store for your stuff from then on.
"
Cat Burglar,"Hey, ey uh,  you want me to do this, you gotta pay up front, kid!
"
Cartman,"You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
"
Michael,"This is Michael with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
"
Cartman,"Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
"
Michael,"Oh-kay, should we contact the police?
"
Cartman,"Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
"
Michael,"Okay, we're contacting them now.
"
Cartman,"He's goin' up the stairs, dude, you'd better hurry!
"
Michael,"Try and stay calm, the police are on their way.
"
Cartman,"Well that's nice, maybe they could bring some cigarettes and Gatorade, 'cause the guy's gonna be pretty wiped out!  The fuck?!
"
UPS Man,"Hey there, misterrr Stotch. looks like another Amazon package. 
"
Stephen,"I know that what I feel for you is just some kind of spell.
"
UPS Man,"...Sss-sorry?
"
Stephen,"Just let me sign.  All right, he's coming to you.
"
Voice,"Hell hello there, Mr. UPS man!
"
UPS Man,"What are you-?
"
Randy,"You should have left our wives alone. Now let's go for a drive.
"
UPS Man,"Look, you can have whatever's in the back! Ih-ihit's all stuff from Amazon!
"
Randy,"Oh no, pull in here.
"
UPS Man,"Just let me go, huh?
"
Randy,"Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 
"
UPS Man,"Aaawwgh! 
"
Stephen,"You should have never come to our town! 
"
Stuart,"A man's wife is his life, Mr. UPS man. 
"
Woman,"Oh my God.
"
Man,"Come on honey! 
"
Randy,"Thought we wouldn't find out??? 
"
Cartman,"Who is there?
"
UPS Man,"Please! 
"
Cartman,"Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?
"
Varashnu,"Hello, this is Varashnu wit Wolf Home Security.
"
Cartman,"A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
"
Varashnu,"...Uh yes, I am in United States.
"
Cartman,"Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
"
Varashnu,"Okay, hold on. 
"
Cartman,"Heh- hello?
"
Kevin,"This is Kevin with Wolf Home Security. Is everything all right?
"
Cartman,"No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
"
Kevin,"We have alarms going off across the country fourteen times a minute. That takes a lot of employees manning phones.
"
Cartman,"Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
"
Kevin,"Sir, it doesn't matter where we call you from, we still contact the police in your neighborhood.
"
Cartman,"Oh really? Oh okay. Gosh I'm so relieved! Thanks. There's still just one little problem: How do you know I didn't break into this house, set off the alarm, and now I'm stalling by being upset about the Indian guy and have actually stolen a bunch of shit, raped my mom, and you people have done absolutely nothing about it?!
"
Kevin,"I d-I d'uh... Wow, that just fucked my head.
"
Cartman,"Yeah I just fucked your head and the UPS guy just fucked my mom! 
"
Sgt. Yates,"All right, quiet down people, please! Quiet!  I know you're all worried about your families' security. All I can tell you is that so far, Bane has not been caught. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?
"
Gerald,"And what do we tell our kids?! We can't leave them in the dark!
"
Randy,"Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
"
Gerald,"What?
"
Randy,"Huh? Nothing.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Now listen! There's nothing more we can do to protect your homes. But there's someone here who says he can. 
"
Security Agent,"Hello folks, we're more than happy to get your homes safe and secure. Now, you're gonna be wanting monitors on all your doors and windows, motion detectors in the living areas, and I would also recommend you all get our newest personal security system to make sure your wives are safe outside the home.
"
Randy,"Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?
"
Spokesman,"Protecting your home and your family is hard enough! But sometimes alarms on your doors and windows aren't enough! A new security system allows not only for your doors and windows to be monitored, but your fear levels as well.  A security system that is actually inside you. It's called IN-security.
"
Husband,"We'll never forget the day we took our twin daughters to the beach.
"
Stranger,"Hehey, what cute twins.
"
Wife,"Thanks.
"
Stranger,"They're so adorable  that I'm gonna bash their fucking heads in! 
"
Peter,"This is Peter with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
Husband,"A white man just tried to murder our twin girls.
"
Peter,"I have a police car on their way with blankets and cocoa. 
"
Husband,"I only hope other have people have INsecurity to protect their families.
"
Shoe Salesman,"Well, how's the shoe fit, pal?
"
Boy,"I think it fits pretty good.
"
Shoe Salesman,"Well okayhehe, let's see if it fits better than this KNIFE THROUGH YOUR FUCKING SKULL, BASTARD?! 
"
Boy,"Aaahh! 
"
Mom,"Hello?
"
David,"This is David with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
Mom,"No, a while shoe salesman tried to murder my son.
"
David,"Hold tight. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa. 
"
Spokesman,"Don't let your family become another statistic. Have piece of mind with...  INsecurity.
"
Kyle,"It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
"
Stan,"You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
"
Kyle,"I know...
"
Cartman,"HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Cartman,"Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
"
Kyle,"Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
"
Cartman,"Oh, fat bitch, huh?!  Well it just so happens that this fat bitch has INsecurity now, Kyle, and so I'm protected from ALL you greedy little Jews until you and your people DIE OUT!
"
Kyle,"The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
"
Cartman,"What?  Hello?
"
Marcus,"This is Marcus with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
Cartman,"Yeah yeah no, false alarm. I, I just heard some troubling news and it set off my INsecurity.
"
Marcus,"All right, could I just get your password please?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
"
Marcus,"I love boobs?
"
Cartman,"No, ""uloveboobs."" Lower-case u love boobs.
"
Marcus,"How did you know that?
"
Cartman,"My password is uloveboobs!
"
Marcus,"Oh oh I get it. That's pretty funny.
"
Cartman,"You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
"
Marcus,"Sure, here you go. 
"
Cartman,"Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
"
Randy,"And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
"
Stuart,"Yeah, but at least we never have to deal with that UPS driver again.
"
Jimbo,"He's back!
"
Stephen,"What?!
"
Jimbo,"I just came from Will Patterson's house! His mother got three packages from Amazon! And the UPS guy told her what he'd like to do to her!
"
Stephen,"How?
"
Jimbo,"He casually dropped this on his way out! 
"
Randy,"Oh my God! 
"
Mechanic,"Didn't kill 'im, did ya?  Yea', I didn't think you had it in ya.
"
Randy,"We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
"
Mechanic,"Milkman don't get scared. Not with free pussy at every doorstep.
"
Stephen,"Son of a bitch, it's him all right!
"
Randy,"This guy doesn't know when to quit!
"
Stephen,"He's stopping at another house. 
"
Mr. Black,"Guess this guy's a lot tougher than we thought. Must be why our wives want him so bad.
"
Randy,"Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?
"
Alvin,"This is Alvin with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
Randy,"Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.
"
Kyle,"Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
"
Sheila,"That's right, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
"
UPS Man,"Uhh, hi, I got a delivery for ya?
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Come in for a minute, would you?
"
UPS Man,"What?
"
Kyle,"Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
"
UPS Man,"What's going on?
"
Kyle,"You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
"
UPS Man,"Don't you think I want to?!  I hate this damned town! Every day, things just keep getting weirder around here, and I'm just about sick of it! Aaah!  Oh my God!  Hello?
"
Brian,"This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
"
UPS Man,"No! They blew up my car! They blew up my car!
"
Brian,"I'm sending help. Police are on their way with blankets and cocoa.
"
UPS Man,"They're after me again! Do something!
"
Brian,"Ho- hold on one second, sir, I have another emergency coming in.  This is Brian with INsecurity, is everything all right?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
"
Gerald,"What the hell's goin' on out here?! 
"
Jimbo,"Stay out of this, Gerald! Some men care about what their wives are doing!
"
Gerald,"What?! You don't even have a wife, Jimbo! 
"
UPS Man,"Somebody answer me! You have to send help now!
"
Martin,"Sir, we are sending help. Just stay calm.  Hang on sir, this is Martin with INsecurity.
"
Randy,"Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
"
Martin,"Hello, this is Martin with INsecu-
"
Cartman,"God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 
"
Mike,"This is Mike with INsecurity. Is everything all right?
"
UPS Man,"Hello?!
"
Kyle,"Dude, come down here!
"
UPS Man,"AAAAH!  Uf. 
"
Sgt. Yates,"So you say this man killed himself because he was a psychopath who was forced to have sex with his mother? 
"
Stephen,"Yes, we found that in his pocket. 
"
Officer,"Sir, we found this in the closet upstairs? 
"
Gerald,"Yes, that's mine.
"
Randy,"Yours? What?
"
Gerald,"Give me that! What we do in our bedroom is our business!
"
Kyle,"Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
"
Gerald,"Uhh, Kyle, uh sometimes when people get older they need to play and pretend to keep things interesting. Iiit's just a way I can still be intimate with your mother without relying on silly sexual enhancement drugs. 
"
The Men,"Hello?
"
Randy,"It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
"
Mechanic,"Yea'. Got yourselves some nice home security systems, don'tcha? Payin' a man to do your job of protecting your house. Only problem is, while you're out feelin' like your things are safe, that security man is fucking your wife.
"
Security Agent,"Doors and windows should be armed and your motion detectors are up and running, just call me whenever you need me back.  Ah! Who are you??
"
Cartman,"It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
"
Security Agent,"Hoo!
"
Cartman,"FELLAS! Fellas!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Cartman,"You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
"
Kyle,"Butters?  Why?
"
Cartman,"It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
"
Stan,"You're talking about Butters.
"
Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 
"
Stan,"Butters?
"
Butters,"Leave me alone!
"
Stan,"Butters, come out here.
"
Butters,"Get out of here, all of ya! 
"
Kyle,"Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
"
Butters,"You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
"
Cartman,"Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
"
Butters,"And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
"
Cartman,"...Wow.
"
Butters,"Double wow! 
"
Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry, but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse.
"
Stephen,"Butters, what on earth has gotten into you?!
"
Butters,"I don't know, Dad, ah I was just pissed off, I guess!
"
Linda,"Do you think this behavior is fair to your teacher and classmates?!
"
Butters,"I don't suppose it is, but I don't give a darn!
"
Stephen,"Do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be, mister?!
"
Butters,"Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
"
Linda,"Stephen, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"
Stephen,"Yes. Our little Butters is flowering. He has reached the age of panua.
"
Principal Victoria,"Eh-excuse me?
"
Stephen,"Principal Victoria, this isn't Butters' fault.
"
Butters,"It's not?!
"
Stephen,"It has to do with... biology.  You've... maybe noticed that Butters isn't... exactly like other kids.
"
Butters,"Yeah?
"
Stephen,"You probably think Butters seems somehow... different.
"
Butters,"Hey yeah, all the time.
"
Stephen,"It's because he is.  His mother and I... his whole family were... we're not of this place.
"
Principal Victoria,"Ah I'm sorry, I really don't understand.
"
Stephen,"Please, just try to understand that for our people it's a very private matter. He can't be helped by your discipline; this must be dealt with by his own kind. If it's all right with you, we'd like an extended leave for our boy. Please. It's a cultural thing.
"
Linda,"I don't want him to go, Stephen, he's too young!
"
Stephen,"It's our people's way, Linda, you know that better than I do!
"
Linda,"Then we can go with him.
"
Stephen,"You know that's not allowed!
"
Butters,"Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
"
Stephen,"Butters, you've reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa.
"
Butters,"Uhbu-but I'm from here.
"
Stephen,"No. We moved here just before you started pre-school. You were born in our native land, Butters.  A distant and very secluded island world called... Hava'i.
"
Butters,"We're from Hawaii?
"
Stephen,"Only haoles pronounce it Hawaii, Butters, but those of us from Hava'i are a very special people. We have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive.  We drink chi-chi's from the coconut. We eat poke that the Safeway provides. And when we've chosen a mate, we marry at the fern grotto, as your mother and I did so... very long ago. As a Stotch, Butters, you are actually Hawaiian royalty. Your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the King. 
"
Butters,"But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
"
Stephen,"Not an emo chick on her period, Butters. Like a salmon needing to swim back upriver. All Hawaiians feel it. It is called ""hapahui apahoha"", and it means it's now your time to make your trip to our island home. You must do your walkabout to your homeland, Butters. And you must do it alone.  Take this, son. It is our Mahalo Rewards card. It will provide you with all you need. And now I must turn my back on you. 
"
Cartman,"Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Cartman,"Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
"
Stan,"Hawaii?
"
Cartman,"He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
"
Kyle,"Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
"
Stan,"After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
"
Kyle,"Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
"
Kenny,"(I'm not his best friend.)
"
Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 
"
Kenny,"(Butters, come on.)
"
Butters,"They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
"
Kenny,"(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
"
Teller,"I already told him, I can't allow anyone on the aircraft who appears to be intoxicated.
"
Butters,"I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua!
"
Kenny,"(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
"
Teller,"Tell you what: there's plenty of points on his Mahalo Rewards card. If you wanna fly with him, I can let him go.
"
Kenny,"(Me?)
"
Butters,"Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
"
Kenny,"(Okay, okay! I'll go.) 
"
Butters,"Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
"
Officer,"Can I help you with anything?
"
Butters,"Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
"
Officer,"Okay, were you wit a cruise ship or land tour group?
"
Butters,"Oh, ah, I'm not a tourist. I'm a native Hawaiian. 
"
Blond Man,"Butters Stotch?
"
Butters,"Yeah?
"
Blond Man,"Welcome home, young keiki. Your parents said you would be coming for your ceremony.  Ah- uh, who's this?
"
Butters,"Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
"
Older Woman,"Butters, native Hawaiians don't really approve of haoles coming to their ceremonies.
"
Butters,"Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
"
Blond Man,"Very well, we shall speak with the chief of our island and see. Come now. 
"
Butters,"You folks are all native Hawaiians too?
"
Older Man,"Yes. My wife Patty and I have been coming to Kaua'i for almost five years, and Bill and Donna actually own a time share in Poipu.
"
Donna,"Yes, but Poipu is getting pretty overrun with tourists, I'm afraid.
"
Blond Man,"Let us eat.
"
Older Man,"Oh yea, let us eat.  Aloha, five order of saimin, please.
"
Butters,"What's ""saimin""?
"
Patty,"It's one of the foods of our people.
"
Older Man,"Oh, I get 20% off, I'm a native. Here's my Mahalo Rewards card.  Mahalo.  Come on, you frickin' tourist! Jesus, buy a post card!  These are the ancient ruins of our ancestors.  They say the spirit of the king is still in there.
"
Blond Man,"You must stay away from this place. It is kapu.
"
Brunet Man,"Kapu. that means ""taboo"",  especially to haoles! 
"
Older Man,"Uh that there is Bubba's Burgers.  In Havai'i us natives say ""Bubba's Bruk"".  Here's the Sheraton, just another megahotel for the throngs of tourists. Here's where many of us natives live. The Sheraton Residences.  It's all right, we're natives.  Protector and Chief, I present to you the keiki, Butters Stotch.
"
Chief,"Ah, Stephen and Linda's child. Last time I saw you, you were the size of a coconut. Who's the haole?
"
Kenny,"My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
"
Stan,"""On the morrow""? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
"
Kenny,"To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.
"
Chief,"In the time-honored traditions of our ancestors, we honor the native Hawaiian Butters Stotch with his hapa noa.  The shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island.  Now drink the chi-chi! 
"
Butters,"Whoa, it's like gasoline!
"
Chief,"Drink, young keiki, and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away.
"
Butters,"Hey, uh now I do feel butter, uh better.
"
Chief,"O spirits of ancestors, we ask that you bless this native Hawaiian with his hapa noa! We ask that you-
"
Blond Man,"Listen!  Listen everyone! I have terrible, horrible news!
"
Chief,"Do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa?
"
Blond Man,"I've just come from the front office! The Mahalo Rewards card is... 
"
Chief,"What?! What has happened? Speak!
"
Blond Man,"The Mahalo Rewards card is being eliminated! They're trying to say our points are... are... no longer going to be accepted.
"
Chief,"I knew one day it would come to this.
"
Patty,"To what? What does this mean?
"
Chief,"The haoles are trying to do away with us.
"
Resident 1,"With no rewards program, there will be no distinction between who's a native to this island and who isn't!
"
Resident 2,"Why can't you people respect our island? Why do you always want nore?!
"
Chief,"I'm sorry keiki, your hapa noa will have to wait! For we must unite together as never before! It is time to show the haoles that this is our island! 
"
Chief,"Stop ruining our island, haoles! FIRE! 
"
First Mate,"What are they doing? 
"
Chief,"Take a swing! Let them know they are not welcome!
"
Butters,"I've never done this before. 
"
Chief,"It's all right. Just try to tap into that anger that's inside you.
"
Butters,"Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! 
"
Man,"Hold on!  Hold on!
"
Woman,"Oh I can't! I can't! I can't hold on!
"
Man,"I love you! I love you!
"
Woman,"No! I love you! I love you back! 
"
Announcer,"This is breaking news!
"
Anchor,"An insurrection in the Hawaiian Islands has escalated to war! After sinking a cruise ship, the natives of Kauai continue to go berserk, forcing all tourists off their island.
"
Man 1,"They just pushed us onto airplanes and said we weren't welcome anymore!
"
Woman 1,"Then a little boy called me a skank.
"
Anchor,"The President says he will send the Coast Guard to take the island back, though he sympathizes, being a native Hawaiian himself.  Hm.
"
Chief,"Are all the tourists gone from our island?
"
Resident 3,"All but a few who are hiding out at Duke's Restaurant. We sent Bob and Trisha Turner to smoke them out.
"
Resident 4,"What about him?
"
Kenny,"(What about me?)
"
Resident 4,"He's a tourist and he knows everything! We have to kill him!
"
Butters,"No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
"
Chief,"Be careful young keiki, your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony. Perhaps we should finish it now.
"
Resident 4,"Finish his ceremony?! We are at war, David! I have lived on this island for ten years. Ten years! Every July and part of August! And I can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide!
"
Resident 5,"He's right, David. We can't trust any tourists.
"
Butters,"He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!
"
Kenny,"(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
"
Resident 6,"Then let him prove himself! Trial by opahika'a!
"
Chief David,"He's only a child!
"
Resident 4,"If he wants to be one of us, then he must face the challenge!
"
Chief David,"Very well. 
"
Blond Man,"This isn't right! He's not a native! He's gonna get killed!
"
Butters,"Kenny, be careful!
"
Chief David,"Quiet. He must face this challenge alone. 
"
Resident 1,"By the gods! Perhaps he has the heart of a native after all!
"
Resident 4,"He still has yet to make the turn! 
"
Residents,"Hohhh!
"
Resident 7,"That's pretty good. 
"
Kenny,"(Whoops!)
"
Butters,"Kenny!
"
Residents,"Awwwww. 
"
Resident 4,"I told you a haole couldn't do it!
"
Chief David,"Did you make the turn your first try? Did any of us? 
"
Resident 8,"Don't worry, Butters, your friend will find a way back to his kind. The gods will protect him. 
"
Chief David,"We have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war, all the native Hawaiian tribes must join as one!
"
Resident 9,"We're not joining the people of the Hyatt Grand Vacations! They have no rights to call themselves natives!
"
Vacationer 1,"Oh and you do?! Your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago! Our ancestors sailed here! On a cruise ship! Nine months ago!
"
Chief David,"Look, if we are to fight the haoles, we have to allow all natives to say!
"
Canyoner,"It doesn't matter how many tribes we have, we can't win! We are but a few against the haole's military might! We may have passion, but passion does not win wars!
"
Chief David,"Oh no? Come up here, keiki. Come on.  This child sunk a cruise ship by himself! Tell them keiki. 
"
Butters,"Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
"
Resident 9,"Yeah!
"
Vacationer 1,"Screw them!
"
Butters,"Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
"
Chief David,"Let us make a pact with more chi-chis!
"
Resident 10,"Um, we're... we're out of chi-chis.
"
Resident 11,"Oh, right, we've closed off all the ports.
"
Resident 12,"But they're still letting vodka through, right? Uh... they can't cut off our chi-chis.
"
Chief David,"...Oh my God.
"
Captain,"This is the U.S. Coast Guard! We have instructions to take you by force, if necessary!
"
Chief David,"Ready? Fire! 
"
Captain,"Fire. 
"
Chief David,"Arm the bocce balls! 
"
Captain,"God damn it.
"
Chief David,"Keep fighting! Stand your ground!
"
Resident 4,"We can't fight without chi-chis!
"
Chief David,"You can and you MUST!
"
Butters,"Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
"
The King,"Come on, come on.  You know what chi-chis are, right?
"
Chief David,"Listen everyone, we gave it all we had. It's over. We must go down to Nowiliwili Harbor, and surrender to the American government.
"
Butters,"Surrender?! No, the heck with that!
"
Resident 4,"We can't hold out here any longer!
"
Butters,"Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
"
Chief David,"Young keiki, try to control your anger.
"
Butters,"No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
"
Resident 13,"Everyone! Look, I say! 
"
Resident 14,"The haole did it!
"
Kenny,"My dear friends of the mainland,
What adventures I have found on the tiny island of Kava'i. I have truly become one with the natives, who found new courage to fight their oppressors.
"
Chief David,"We are not surrendering today! Go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end! 
"
Captain,"You people just don't give up, do ya?
"
Kenny,"The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
"
Kenny,"With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
"
Chief David,"And so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa. Take your cards, boys.  Apuiloa hapnanoaha! Hapa'a'a hohaaa!  It's finally over, young keiki. Is your anger at rest?
"
Butters,"Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
"
Resident 15,"Ben Affleck isn't with Jennifer Lopez anymore, he's married to Jennifer Gardner.
"
Residents,"Yeah, it's true, uh huh.
"
Butters,"What? Really? But I thought I was totally jealous of him. He's just married to Jennifer Gardner? Oh my God, I feel so much better. 
"
Kenny,"(You do?)
"
Butters,"Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
"
Randy,"Hellooo family!  Who wants champagne? 
"
Sharon,"Randy, what is all this? 
"
Randy,"It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
"
Sharon,"Oho, Randy, it's beautiful!
"
Randy,"And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
"
Stan,"We're rich?
"
Shelly,"Finally.
"
Sharon,"Randy, are you being serious? 
"
Randy,"I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 
"
Stan,"Blockbuster Video?
"
Randy,"Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
"
Randy,"You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
"
Sharon,"I just wish you'd have talked to me before spending all our money.
"
Randy,"Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
"
Stan,"Huh? Sorry, I'm watching a movie on my iPad. 
"
Randy,"Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 
"
Shelly,"I don't wanna go in there.
"
Randy,"Shelly come on!
"
Randy,"Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?
"
Stan,"It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
"
Randy,"Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
"
Sharon,"I didn't say anything.
"
Randy,"You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
"
Randy,"How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
"
Shelly,"Six.  We still, have, SIX. 
"
Randy,"Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
"
Boy,"Go get it, Fillmore! 
"
Fillmore,"No way, I ain't goin' nere that place. Yeeeyou go get it. 
"
Randy,"Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
"
Boy,"What's he talkin' about rentin' a divadee?
"
Randy,"Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!
"
Fillmore and Friend,"AAAAAH! 
"
Randy,"Little fucking pricks. 
"
Randy,"Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?
"
Shopper,"I can't find...  Turner & Hooch.  Where's Turner & Hooch?
"
Randy,"Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
"
Shopper,"Aahh... 
"
Randy,"Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
"
Ghost,"Emily?  Emily, the war is over! Let's go rent a movie at Blockbuster!
"
Randy,"Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
"
Ghost,"The hounds are calling, Emily. Let's rent something now! 
"
Randy,"I'll have you know that Netflix, Hulu, and Crackle still don't make the money Blockbuster does! Streaming movies is not for everyone!
"
Ghost,"The hounds, Emily! The hounds!
"
Randy,"Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  ""Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!""  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
"
Stan,"I think something might be wrong with Dad?
"
Sharon,"Ya think? 
"
Butters,"Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
"
Cartman,"We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
Cartman,"Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
"
Butters,"I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
"
Jimmy,"Wop. Wop, Wop wop, Wopwop Gangnam Style. 
"
Cartman,"Yyeah, really cool, guys. You'll be some stiff compettion at the costume contest for sure.
"
Butters,"Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
"
Cartman,"You'll just have to wait and see.
"
Sharon,"I think that's good. Feel tight enough?
"
Stan,"Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.
"
Sharon,"Let's see the shield.
"
Stan,"Put down the blue orby thing, Red Skull!
"
Sharon,"Yehay!
"
Randy,"Hey, whoa, what are you doing?
"
Sharon,"Stan's about to go out with his friends.
"
Randy,"Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!
"
Sharon,"For what?!
"
Randy,"Agh! It's Halloween! Everyone rents scary movies on Halloween! I'm sorry Stanley, but I need your help here!
"
Shelly,"God I hate this family!
"
Sharon,"Randy, let him go trick-or-treating.
"
Randy,"You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.
"
Stan,"Dad, nobody's gonna come.
"
Randy,"Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
"
Stan,"Renting DVDs is more ancient than Madonna's boobs!
"
Randy,"Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!
"
Stan,"I can't go trick-or-treating! My dad says I have to stay and help with the store! Yes, I'm serious! I know it sucks, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
"
Stan,"I know, but there's nothing I can do.
"
Kyle,"But what about the costume contest?!
"
Kenny,"What's going on, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Stan can't come.
"
Cartman,"Stan can't come?! But he's fucking Captain America!
"
Stan,"I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
"
Kyle,"Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
"
Stan,"No dude. Nobody. My dad... he's kind of losing it. To be honest, I feel kind of bad for him.
"
Randy,"Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 
"
Stan,"Oh never mind, I hate him again.
"
Kyle,"Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
"
Stan,"Yeah.
"
Kyle,"Okay, I'm gonna go grab mine. I have an idea.
"
Kyle,"All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?
"
Stan,"How about we try the Barkers? Oh, no, it looks like they're not home.
"
Cartman,"This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
"
Kyle,"He looks fine.
"
Stan,"Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" 
"
The Boys,"Trick or treat.
"
Stan,"Trick or treat.
"
Man 1,"Oh wuhow! Look honey, it's Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and Bruce Vilanch. 
"
Cartman,"I'm not Bruce Vilanch!
"
Man 1,"Oh, what are you supposed to be? Oh  oh, right. You're supposed to be that um... uhhh... 
"
Cartman,"The Incredible...
"
Man 1,"Right right, the incredibly Chaz Bono. Remember honey? Dancing with the Stars? The fat transsexual?
"
Woman 1,"Ohhh, cute!
"
Cartman,"No not Chaz Bono! Do you see my skin?! I'm green!
"
Woman 1,"The incredible Harvey Fierstein?
"
Man 1,"Nnoo, Harvey Fierstein's just gay and fat, honey. He's not green.
"
Cartman,"The person I'm dressed as is not fat, and not gay!
"
Man 1,"The incredibly fat and gay skinny straight man?
"
Cartman,"JUST GIVE US SOME FUCKING CANDY!  It's Stan's stupid Captain America costume! That's what's throwing everybody off! How are people supposed to get that I'm the Hulk when Captain America is on freaking FaceTime?! 
"
The Boys,"Trick or treat.
"
Man 2,"Ohh wow, it's the Avengers!
"
Cartman,"That's right!
"
Man 2,"Oho, and Honey Boo Boo!  Kids, come see the green Honey Boo Boo costume!
"
Girlfriend,"Oh, it's getting colder out.
"
Boyfriend,"Yeah, you can definitely tell that winter's coming.  What's the matter?
"
Girlfriend,"That old creepy place. I saw someone in the window there. 
"
Boyfriend,"Come on, let's get out of here. 
"
Randy,"They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
"
Randy,"Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
"
Ghost 2,"Of course, Mr. Marsh. What'll it be?
"
Randy,"I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
"
Ghost 2,"Coming right up. 
"
Randy,"No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
"
Ghost 2,"Your son and wife don't seem to quite agree with you about the video store. In fact, your son seems to think video stores are... as ancient as Madonna's boobs?
"
Randy,"He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
"
Ghost 2,"If I may say so, Mr. Marsh, your Blockbuster will never get any customers with those two Negative Nancys sabotaging you. You may need to do something... rather extreme.  If I may say so, Mr. Marsh. 
"
Stan,"Trick or treat.
"
Ghost 2,"You are the owner of Blockbuster, Mr. Marsh.  You must be willing to do anything.
"
Randy,"No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
"
Kyle,"We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
"
Cartman,"Dude dude dude! Check it out. 
"
Stan,"What? What's he doing?
"
Kyle,"Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
"
Cartman,"You guys, we've gotta stop it!
"
Kyle,"Yeah dude! We are the Avengers!
"
Stan,"Hey, where did you guys go?
"
Kyle,"Oh, sorry dude.
"
Stan,"All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
"
Kenny,"Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
"
Cartman,"Cartman SMASH! 
"
Robber 1,"All right, the camera's out. Hurry up, you two! 
"
Robber 2,"What the? You told me these things were full of money!
"
Robber 3,"It's Halloween. I thought everyone would be renting spooky movies. 
"
Kyle,"For Odin! For Asgard!
"
Robber 4,"Who are you?!
"
Cartman,"Oh crap, there's a bunch of them. Never mind.  Holy shit, they shot this guy.
"
Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
Kenny,"Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! 
"
Robber 4,"Get 'em!
"
Sharon,"Oh my gosh, that's so cute. And so what is little Monica wearing? Oho, I bet she's adorable.  No, we've just sort of been here for the most part. Yeah, are you guys staying in?  You're watching The Thing? Oh that's fun. On Netflix or Hulu? On your Xbox, uh huh. Yeah, no, at some point I'm hoping we can just call it a night and go home.  No, you don't need to send help. Thanks, though. Are you guys getting a lot of trick-or-treaters? Yeah? Oh really?  Oh, Barbara and Michael? Oh yeah. Uh huh. Ha-hang on a second Karen.  Can I help you with something?
"
Randy,"According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 
"
Sharon,"Sorry, Karen, you were saying? No, it wasn't a customer. No, it's just Randy.  Yes, a customer would have been nice, I know.
"
Robber 1,"God damn it those kids saw us! And you let them get away!
"
Robber 3,"It was the Avengers, Brad! 
"
Robber 2,"Hey, we caught one of them. We got him tied up in the back. 
"
Robber 1,"All right, who were your friends?
"
Stan,"Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
"
Robber 2,"He's lying. They saw everything!
"
Robber 1,"Let's try this again. 
"
Stan,"No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
"
Robber 4,"Hey, one of them dropped this.  It's an invitation to a Monster Mash at the community center.
"
Stan,"No no! We weren't gonna go there!
"
Robber 1,"Sure you weren't!  Get rid of him!
"
Stan,"NO!  I won't say anything, I promise! 
"
Stan,"What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
"
Robber 3,"Sorry, kid. End of the line. 
"
Stan,"What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
"
Shelly,"I can't find it. Somebody took it.
"
Sharon,"All right Randy, where are the car keys?!  Randy, where are the keys to the car?!  God damn it! 
"
Boyfriend,"Did you have fun at the Halloween party?
"
Girlfriend,"I did. Thanks so much, Ben. And thanks for walking me home. 
"
Ben,"What's the matter?
"
Girlfriend,"What is that? 
"
Ben,"Whaht is what?
"
Girlfriend,"Somebody dumped a... Oh my God, Ben, it's a little boy!  Hello?  Are you okay? Little boy?
"
Stan,"Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
"
Girlfriend,"It's okay. Try and stay calm.
"
Stan,"Oh, ah thank God you found me.
"
Ben,"What is he doing way out here?
"
Stan,"You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
"
Kyle,"And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
"
Sgt. Yates,"Sounds like you're talking about the Red Box killers. They've murdered over a dozen people trying to get the cash from Red Boxes.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
"
Sgt. Yates,"Apparently not. These are dangerous guys. Do you have any idea where they were headed?
"
Officer,"Sir, there's a kid over at the hospital saying he saw everything.
"
Stan,"They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
"
Kyle,"Stan! 
"
Stan,"Guys, you're okay!
"
Kyle,"What happened to you?
"
Stan,"It's all right, just a scratch.
"
Cartman,"Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
"
Stan,"No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
"
Sgt. Yates,"What?! Are you crazy?! We can't cancel the Monster Mash, it's Halloween Night! It's the Monster Mash's biggest night of the year!
"
Officer 2,"The Monster Mash is only on Halloween. 
"
Kyle,"Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
"
Stan,"Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.
"
Sgt. Yates,"How many people at the Monster Mash?
"
Officer 3,"Most of the town, sir. It's a graveyard smash.
"
Officer 4,"Look, whatever we do, we'd better hurry. It gets on in a flash.
"
Sgt. Yates,"You boys say you can identify the Red Box thieves?
"
Kenny,"Yes. We saw their faces.
"
Sgt. Yates,"All right then. We're gonna have to send one of you into the party in disguise.
"
Butters,"That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
"
Stan,"Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
"
Butters,"Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. 
"
Stan,"Oops.
"
Man 3,"Gaaah!
"
Stan,"Hey, be careful in there.
"
Officer 3,"Sorry. I can't see a thing in here.
"
Stan,"It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
"
A Banana,"Wow, Gangnamstein. I wish I'd have thought of that.
"
Randy,"Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
"
Shelly,"Nothing, Dad. Go back to killing the family. 
"
Randy,"Okay.  STAN!  STANNY BOY, I'M COMIN'!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay.
"
Stan,"Wait a minute. There they are!
"
Mr. Garrison,"There's who? 
"
Stan,"Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
"
Randy,"Who are you people?! You aren't real!
"
Officer 3,"Hey hay, I can't see! Where do I go? 
"
Randy,"Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
"
Randy,"Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
"
Family,"HAAAAA! 
"
Randy,"Haarrrr! 
"
Randy,"Raaaawr! 
"
Boys,"AAAAA!
"
Randy,"Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!
"
Boys,"AAAAA!  AAAAA!
"
Randy,"AAAAA!  AAAAA! 
"
Sgt. Yates,"FIRE! 
"
Randy,"Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?!
"
Stan,"It's mine, Dad, get your own! What the hell's going on?! 
"
Sgt. Yates,"We got the sonofabitch!
"
Officer 5,"Wait, wasn't that Peterson in there? 
"
Sgt. Yates,"Well, I hope you guys have learned that crime doesn't pay.
"
Robber 1,"Not with the convenience of online streaming it don't.
"
Butters,"Kyle! Kyle! It's Stan! He's dying. 
"
Kyle,"Stan?
"
Stan,"Hey dude.
"
Kyle,"The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
"
Stan,"It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
"
Kyle,"You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
"
Stan,"Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
"
Kenny,"Yeah, Stan?
"
Stan,"Stay gold. 
"
Randy,"Stan?! I'm comin'! I'm comin', Stan!  Stan! 
"
Sharon,"I spoke with the insurance company.  They said we can get some of our money back. Not all of it, but some. You wanna go home? Get changed? Take a shower?
"
Randy,"No...
"
Sharon,"You wanna just sit here a little more and be frozen?
"
Randy,"Yeah...
"
Sharon,"You want me to bring you some McDonald's?
"
Randy,"Okay...
"
Sharon,"What do you want from McDonald's?
"
Randy,"Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 
"
Pharmacist,"Next please.  You are sure you want to do this?
"
Man,"Of course I'm sure!
"
Pharmacist,"Okay, roll up your sleeve. 
"
Cartman,"I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
"
Clyde,"Lying jerk! 
"
Pharmacist,"Hold still please.
"
Mr. Mackey,"I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 
"
Cartman,"All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
"
Man 2,"All right, I'm next! I'm next! Get this thing off of me! 
"
Kyle,"Did you do it?
"
Cartman,"Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
"
Kenny,"(I told you it was a bad idea.)
"
Cartman,"Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
"
Randy,"Oh I feel like such an idiot.
"
Stan,"It's all right, Dad.
"
Randy,"But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.
"
Anchor,"These latest tests are once again confirming that the performance-enhancing drug HGH was in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. All over the country people are having their ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristbands cut off. It was just last week a team of scientists found traces of HGH on the Shroud of Turin  , along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers. 
"
Lead Scientist,"Without a doubt there was uh HGH in the body of Christ at the time of crucifixion. Jesus did not suffer for our sins, he was in fact very high.
"
Randy,"All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
"
Anchor,"Priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove Jesus from the record books and from The Last Supper. 
"
Randy,"I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 
"
Butters,"Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?""
"
Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
Butters,"And he says, ""Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up.""
"
Cartman,"So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet!
"
Stan,"All right all right, I got it a few weeks ago. Big whoop.
"
Cartman,"The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
"
Butters,"Yeah, Stan. Didn't you hear Jesus did all his miracles on drugs?
"
Stan,"Yeah I know.
"
Cartman,"Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?
"
Craig,"Cartman's right. If you care about fairness, Stan, then you really have to lose the bracelet.
"
Stan,"Look I just don't want to, you guys. Honestly, it's not that big a deal.
"
Announcer,"It's the Charlie Rose show. Here's Chuck.
"
Charlie Rose,"We are here tonight with the only person in America who still wears his ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristband. Please welcome Stan Marsh.
"
A Voice,"Dick! 
"
Charlie Rose,"Stan, after everything that's come out, after all the facts have been proven, why do you still wear the wristband?
"
Stan,"I don't know,  I just like it.
"
Charlie Rose,"You just like it.
"
Stan,"Yeah. I donno. I've had it a long time, I just don't feel like cutting it off.
"
Charlie Rose,"Well joining us now is just one of the billions of people who think that anyone who still wears their ""What Would Jesus Do"" wristband is doing all of society a disservice. Chris Martin you say that Stan Marsh is... a dick?
"
Chris Martin,"Yeah, yeah, thanks Charlie. My problem with this kid is he doesn't care about the truth! Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that's fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus's name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud! Wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone!
"
Charlie Rose,"What do you say about that, Stan?
"
Stan,"...I don't know.  I like it.
"
Charlie Rose,"All right, well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with Stan Marsh, and thinks he's doing the right thing. Please welcome a retarded fish.  Now, Retarded Fish, you don't see any problem at all with someone keeping their bracelet 
"
Chris Martin,"That that's because, that's because you're a retarded fish, and you don't know any better! What about the Crusades?! The Inquisitions?! How many people were tortured to death for somebody who is a fake?! 
"
Charlie Rose,"What about the Crusades, Stan? Soes that enter into your decision at all?
"
Stan,"No, I just, I don' know. No.
"
Charlie Rose,"Anything to add, Retarded Fish?
"
Retarded Fish,"Nnno, No, I'm good. Thank you.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you?  Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?
"
Stan,"I have?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.
"
Stan,"You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it.  Hey Butters. Stand ground.
"
Butters,"Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? 
"
Stan,"You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?
"
Butters,"Well yeah.  It helps remind me that I shouldn't back down anymore when I feel pressure from other people. I just got really moved when I saw what did for all those farmers in Belarus. 
"
Stan,"...Farmers in where?
"
Worker,"Move aside, farmers! This land is no longer yours!
"
Farmer,"We will not move aside! We will stand our ground!  Like the child on the Charlie Rose show! 
"
Stan,"Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
"
Butters,"I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
"
Clerk,"Hello, you interested in the Stanground braceleh-OH! Wow, it's you!  Stanground, brah!
"
Stan,"Wow, this is happening so fast.
"
Steve Nelson,"Hello Stan, Steve Nelson with Endorsement Management. Are you ready for your Nike commercial? 
"
Stan,"My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.
"
Waiter,"Would you like to be seated?
"
Stan,"No thanks. I'll stand.
"
Moviegoer,"Hey, you wanna siddown?
"
Stan,"I'm good.
"
Flight Attendant,"Sir, the captain has asked everyone to take their seats.
"
Stan,"Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, ""You never took the bracelet off? Not once?""  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-? 
"
Lawyer,"Mr. Marsh, if you don't mine, we'd like to see your bracelet.
"
Stan,"For what?
"
Lead Scientist,"If you have nothing to hide, then please hand it over, Mr. Marsh.
"
Kyle,"What are you people talking about?
"
Field Reporter,"Are we good? We live? Tom, I'm here at South Park Elementary, where officials have barged their way in after reports of Stan Marsh of the Stanground Foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet. Rumors have surfaced that Stan did not stan his ground as previously stated, and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together.
"
Lead Scientist,"Please let us check your wristband for superglue.
"
Stan,"No! This is stupid!
"
Butters,"He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
"
Lead Scientist,"Are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet, Mr. Marsh?
"
Stan,"No! I never cut if off!
"
Lead Scientist,"Then, let us ah-see it.
"
Jimmy,"This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
"
Lead Scientist,"I cannot say, but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige.
"
Butters,"Who?
"
Lead Scientist,"All right, it was Craig. 
"
Cartman,"Craig?! You asshole!
"
Stan,"What's the big idea, Craig?!
"
Craig,"It just looked like you cut it off, that's all.
"
Stan,"You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
"
Butters,"Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
"
The Class,"Yeah!
"
Stan,"You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
"
Butters,"Go Stan!
"
Stan,"And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
"
Butters,"...A little unnecessary, but go Stan!
"
Stan,"Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
"
The Class,"Yeah!
"
Butters,"Prostitute!
"
Announcer,"This is breaking news.
"
Anchor,"The tests are done and the results are in. The little boy who claimed he never cut off his ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet did cut it off, and lied about it.
"
Lead Scientist,"Not only did we find traces of ah-superglue, but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well. This is a dark ah-day for honest French-Swedish people everywheure.
"
Anchor,"Though the tests seem conclusive, Stan Marsh continues to deny any cheating.
"
Stan,"Yeah. 
"
Kyle,"Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
"
Stan,"Thanks Kyle.
"
Kyle,"You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
"
Stan,"Why does it matter?!
"
Kyle,"Because you kind of made it matter.
"
Stan,"You know, I'm just, I'm just through with this whole thing! I just, I can't put my family through any more of this!
"
Kyle,"S-so you did superglue it.
"
Stan,"Ugh, you know what's really sad?! That this is what matters to people! What nobody seems to remember are the farmers in Belarus! STANground is bigger than me! You wanna tell all those farmers in Belarus it's all bullcrap?!
"
Kyle,"Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
"
Stan,"You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
"
Wife,"Would you mind getting me some water, darling?
"
Lead Scientist,"Can't you see I'm trying to do ah-my calisthenics?
"
Wife,"But my throat is parched, dear, and I'm so scared of burglars.
"
Lead Scientist,"Is ah-tap water going to be okay, or do you want me to go down to Crystal Geyser and bring Her Highness some right from the spring?
"
Wife,"Tap is fine, dear. 
"
Wife,"What was that? I could have sworn I saw something outside.
"
Lead Scientist,"It's ah-your imagination
"
Wife,"Oh darling, could you change the channel for me? The remote is dead. 
"
Lead Scientist,"You just want me to change the channel or should I go and make a TV program written ah-just for you?!
"
Wife,"No, just change to channel 10, thanks.
"
Lead Scientist,"It's ah-starting to feel like ah-The Carole Burnett Show in here. 
"
Wife,"What was that?! I think somebody's here!
"
Lead Scientist,"Maybe it's ah-the peepee fairy so somebody can ah-take a peepee for you too.
"
Wife,"Please I'm terrified. Please go check it out. 
"
Stan,"Jesus!
"
Jesus,"Shhhh.
"
Stan,"What are you doing here?
"
Jesus,"My child, the man who lives here has led a witch hunt to destroy my legacy. I am simply here to search for something I can use...
"
Stan and Jesus,"...to discredit him too.
"
Jesus,"That's what I'm doing. 
"
Lead Scientist,"Oh, it's ah-Tweedle Dumb and ah-Tweedle Dee trying to break in-ah-to my house!
"
Stan,"Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
"
Jesus,"Sometimes it is best to say nothing, my son.
"
Stan,"Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.
"
Lead Scientist,"Ah-excuse me, I'm sorry to intrude, but do you want to please ah-leave or should I make you some kofel bread and ah-sausages?!
"
Stan,"It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
"
Jesus,"Yeah, I know how it goes.
"
Stan,"Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
"
Jesus,"I know. I just feel like if people could see me in action again, they'd they'd realize I'm not a fraud.
"
Lead Scientist,"Here you go, kofel bread and some sausage for you.
"
Stan,"Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
"
Jesus,"NO! Pff! That's just... no! Okay? No. Everyone just lost their faith. Did you cut your wristband off, my son?
"
Stan,"NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
"
Jesus,"Pff, I know, right?
"
Stan,"Pff it's like, that's here  and...
"
Jesus,"Pfyeah and we're, like, you know, p-yeah, here. 
"
Stan,"Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
"
Jesus,"P-yeah! Instead of focusing on us, we need to get everyone focusing on what matters! Where's Belaruh-ruh-roos?
"
Stan,"Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
"
Jesus,"Maybe, if we could get people to care about it, then I could go and save it, and people would be stoked on me again!
"
Stan,"How can we raise awareness?
"
Jesus,"We need to get some bracelets.
"
P.F. Pityef,"Welcome, welcome, to the P.F. Pityef Bracelet Factory. How can I be of service?
"
Stan,"Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
"
P.F. Pityef,"Ah, I see you're wearing one of our brown scauses already. Delightful. What color would you like your new scause to be?
"
Stan,"Our... scause?
"
P.F. Pityef,"Well of course! You came for a scause to wear on your paws. And you want others to wear yours upon thaurs.
"
Jesus,"I'm confused.
"
P.F. Pityef,"Hm. Perhaps I should start from the beginning. 
In the modern age there are those who believe
That a cause is a thing to be worn on one's sleeve. 
And so, we sell a cause. It's called a scause.
And wearing a scause gets you lots of applause. 
We start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpist
Then dip it in colors that show off your purpose.
There are green scauses for recycling, blue scauses for kitties, 
And pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties. 
Do you hate abortion? Ah! Then a white scause is for you! 
Why not champion your scause with some sparkles and glue?
We make scauses for this! We make scauses for that! 
Why there's even a scause for just being fat! 
What's the matter? Can't think of a scause? 
How about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozz?
Let's just think of the thing that you care about most. 
Then let's make it orange, like marmalade toast!
And now I'd like to say ""thank you"" for your coming down.
I'm off to go sell these in your little town!
"
Stan,"Dude, the hell just happen?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter.  You probably all noticed my orange wristband , mkay? It's to show my solidarity with the people of Belarus.  Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to-
"
Craig,"We know, Mr. Mackey. We all have our Belarus bracelets too. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay.  Uh hey kids. Kids over here...
"
Cartman,"Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
"
Clyde,"There's a guy selling them downtown. But they're not made from recycled plastic.
"
Cartman,"Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
"
Clyde,"Yes you do. 
"
Cartman,"...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
"
Butters,"Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
"
Stan,"People are saying that? 
"
Butters,"Yeeah. Is it true?
"
Stan,"Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
"
Butters,"Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
"
Stan,"We did it. 
"
Anchor,"It has become the biggest concern for most people. The farmers of Belarus and their plight against their government. And now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis. His name? Jesus.
"
Jesus,"These are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives. You know I'm uh, ah-I'm here just to do whatever I can.
"
Field Reporter,"Jesus, some people might be thinking you're doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use?
"
Jesus,"You know, ah I don't even have time to think about that. This is a crisis that needs my attention and I'm just here to do whatever I can. I've talked to the government here and I've talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. 
"
Farmers,"AAAAH!! 
"
Jesus,"You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn't change the fact that the people of Belarrus need my help.
"
Field Reporter,"Ah I believe it's Belarus, Jesus.
"
Jesus,"Yes, it very well may be if we don't do something now. 
"
Field Reporter,"Um, so you think you've something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?
"
Jesus,"I'm just doing what I've always done. People wanna know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on a farm in Belarrus busting my ass! What are you on?!
"
Field Reporter,"Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?
"
Jesus,"What?  Aw, shit!
"
P.F. Pityef,"One at a time, please. One at a time.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?!  It's worthless now!
"
P.F. Pityef,"Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I'll give you two more!
"
Cartman,"Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.
"
P.F. Pityef,"Absolutely! Five dollars please.
"
Kyle,"Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.
"
Stan,"Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
"
P.F. Pityef,"Oh my, it's the sound!
"
Butters,"Wu-what sound?
"
P.F. Pityef,"Of all sounds in all sounddom this one's most profound.  That's the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It's the sound of the last cent being spent.  My work here is done, and just look at you now! You're all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I'm off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!
"
Cartman,"...Fuck! Dude, weak. 
"
Stan,"It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
"
Jesus,"Yeah...
"
Stan,"We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
"
Jesus,"Yeah, well, I guess we're just gonna have to accept that people aren't gonna think very highly of us.
"
Stan,"Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
"
Jesus,"What can we possibly do?
"
Stan,"What would Jesus do?  Yeheah! 
"
Jesus,"Vengeance is mine! 
"
P.F. Pityef,"No please! Please show mercy!
"
Jesus,"Get out! 
"
Jesus,"Thank you my children.  We've all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn't mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn't do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn't. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn't be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let's keep our causes where they belong, which is  right here. On T-shirts!  Free Pussy Riot! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Free Pussy Riot!
"
The Boys,"Yeah!
"
Denver Poll Worker,"Okay, Mr. Thompson, voting line is right over there.  Next, please. 
"
Cartman,"Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
"
Denver Poll Worker,"Oh dear, did you lose your mother, little boy?
"
Cartman,"MOM!
"
Denver Poll Worker,"Security?
"
Denver Guard,"Heaah?
"
Denver Poll Worker,"This little boy lost his mom.
"
Cartman,"She said to wait for her by the... plastic boxes if I got lost.
"
Denver Guard,"It's all right, come on. 
"
Cartman,"Mom? Where's my mom?
"
Charlotte Poll Worker,"Oh dear. Did you lose your mommy, little boy?
"
Flight Attendant 1,"Would you like some warm nuts, sir?
"
Cartman,"""Warm nuts"", she said.
"
Cartman,"Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
"
Flight Attendant 2,"Warm nuts, sir? Warm nuts?
"
Cartman,"No way dude. No way.
"
Cartman,"MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
"
Flight Attendant 3,"Would you like warm nuts, sir? 
"
Cartman,"Ahaha, okay okay it's getting old. 
"
Cartman,"MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
"
Anchor,"The people have spoken, and the President of the United States is once again, Barack Obama.
"
President Obama,"I assure you all, I am heading back to the White House more motivated - more titillated - than ever. 
"
Kyle,"Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
"
Cartman,"Hey Kyle. What's up?
"
Kyle,"Nothing, watching the election results.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Cartman,"Please, Kyle. It's kind of important.
"
Kyle,"Alright, what is this all about, fatass?!
"
Cartman,"You happy with the election results last night, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
"
Cartman,"Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
"
Kyle,"Sure you do!
"
Cartman,"What if I did, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
"
Cartman,"Pretty sweet, huh?
"
Kyle,"What the hell is this?
"
Cartman,"What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
"
Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
Cartman,"No, really. There are states full of swingers. Bunch of perverts if you ask me.
"
Kyle,"Why do you have these?
"
Cartman,"Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
"
Kyle,"Dude!
"
Cartman,"Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
"
Kyle,"Knock it off, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"Now, believe it or not, Kyle, I actually need your help. But first you have to promise not to tell anyone.
"
Kyle,"You're not getting away with this, you fat turd! 
"
Cartman,"Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
"
Liane,"Sweetie, there's a Mr. Pun Li Tsiao on the phone for you?
"
Cartman,"Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
"
Agent,"Mr. President?
"
President Obama,"Yes?
"
Agent,"Line 2 from China for you, sir. It's General Tso.
"
President Obama,"Yes, hello General.
"
General Tso,"We assume you are preased with the erection results?
"
President Obama,"Very pleased. Thank you for your help.
"
General Tso,"And you no doubt will now begin filling your side of the bargain.
"
President Obama,"You'll have what you want. I'll meet you in three hours. 
"
Agent,"Sir, the election may have gone the way they said, but we can't possibly give the Chinese what you promised.
"
President Obama,"I don't know how they did it, but the Chinese secured my victory. I have to fulfill my obligation.
"
Agent,"And what if General Tso suddenly gets the courage to go to the press with all this?
"
President Obama,"Don't worry. Everyone knows General Tso's chicken.
"
Officer 1,"Eric Cartman? We have a report you might be involved in voter fraud?
"
Cartman,"Hmmm, no.
"
Officer 2,"You mind if we search your room?
"
Cartman,"I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
"
Kyle,"This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
"
Officer 1,"Let's just see. 
"
Cartman,"Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
"
Kyle,"Upstairs! First door to the left!
"
Cartman,"I know my rights! Stop right now! 
"
Kyle,"But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
"
Cartman,"I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
"
Officer 2,"Oh my God, what have we done?
"
Officer 1,"Guess this country is changing. We're sorry little boy, we're SO sorry. 
"
Kyle,"Please you've, you've got to believe me! They've still gotta be here somewhere! Uh we've got to find them!
"
Cartman,"But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
"
Kyle,"Guys! You guys!  Listen: Cartman has tens of thousands of voter ballots hidden somewhere. He's changed the outcome of the election!
"
Stan,"Wow, really? That's pretty impressive.
"
Kyle,"Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
"
Stan,"But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
"
Kyle,"Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
"
Stan,"I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
"
Jimmy,"Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.
"
Craig,"Whenever I'm confused about what's going on in a movie, I'm always so relieved when Morgan Freeman shows up and explains the plot to me.
"
Kyle,"God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
"
Butters,"Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
"
Kyle,"Butters, you know something, don't you?!
"
Butters,"Huh? Wha? NO. Uhuh, why?
"
Kyle,"What did Cartman tell you?!
"
Butters,"He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
"
Kyle,"Tell us what you know right now!
"
Butters,"I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
"
Stan,"Is that an M&M?
"
Butters,"It's an almond M&M. Ah-I'm very allergic to almonds. Heey, just leave me alone.
"
Kyle,"Then you have to tell us!
"
Butters,"Well... hah... HWAAAH! 
"
Kyle,"Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! 
"
Stan,"Pry his mouth open!
"
Craig,"He ate it!
"
Stan,"Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
"
Butters,"Ah! Bah! I hate almonds. 
"
Waitress,"More melted butter, sir?
"
Cartman,"Mm, mhm, mhm.
"
General Tso,"Little boy, the President is on his way to pick up the ballots. Where are they?!
"
Cartman,"They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
"
General Tso,"Alter our... The President will be here in moments with what we want!
"
Cartman,"Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
"
A Diner,"Oh my God, it's the President! 
"
President Obama,"Thank you, thank you all for your votes of confidence. If I could... just be a little rude and ask for a nice quiet meal in private?
"
Diner 1,"Oh, of course. Come on, let's let the President have some peace and quiet. 
"
Diner 2,"Wow, the President eats at Red Lobster. He's just a normal guy like me.
"
Diner 3,"Come on guys. President says ""get out."" 
"
Diner 4,"I didn't actually vote for him. 
"
President Obama,"All right. Where are the ballots? 
"
Doctor,"Your friend has had a severe allergic reaction.
"
Kyle,"Can we please just try and talk to him?
"
Doctor,"All right, but don't take too long. 
"
Butters,"What's up fellas?
"
Kyle,"Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
"
Butters,"Bleh, ogayedmi.
"
Kyle,"I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
"
Butters,"AGH! No! Please! You can't!
"
Kyle,"Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
"
Butters,"Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
"
Stan,"What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
"
Kyle,"What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
"
Butters,"At Red Robster. 
"
Kenny,"(At Red Lobster.)
"
Kyle,"Where?
"
Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
Stan,"Huh?
"
Jimmy,"He said ""at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red""
"
Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
Kenny,"(Red Lobster!)
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Jimmy,"Ruh Rehh... Red
"
Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
Kenny,"(Red Lobster!)
"
Stan,"Oh, Red Lobster.
"
President Obama,"General Tso, do you have the missing ballots or not?
"
General Tso,"Sssure, we have the ballots, but we don't have them right here with us now. 
"
President Obama,"Okay, you want me to come in again, we can start over, what the fuck is this?!
"
Kyle,"All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
"
Cartman,"Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
"
General Tso,"Mr. President, we got you reelected! Now you will give us the Star Wars technology so that we can make the sequels!
"
President Obama,"I told you China would get the rights to Star Wars from Disney as long as my Presidency was secure!  Until I have those ballots  it is not secure!
"
Kyle,"Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
"
Morgan Freeman,"What's going on is the sale of America's greatest asset.  You see, when the United States created Star Wars it made this country incredibly powerful.
"
General Tso,"Morgan Freeman?
"
Morgan Freeman,"Earlier this week, Lucas signed the rights to Star Wars over to Disney, and the Chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves. The Chinese government knew that President Obama would help them take the rights from Disney if they helped him get reelected.
"
Craig,"Ohhhh.
"
Morgan Freeman,"But the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them, and won't give them to anyone until his demands are met. You've all got quite a mess on your hands. I wish you well with it. 
"
Stan,"Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
"
Morgan Freeman,"Because every time I show up and explain something, I earn a freckle. 
"
Cartman,"So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
"
General Tso,"That was not the deal! We will not be a-bullied by you!
"
Cartman,"Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
"
Jimmy,"Heheh, I get it. General Tso's chih-chih-chicken.
"
Mike,"You are absolutely sure about this?
"
Agent 2,"It's been confirmed, Mike. My God, we might have won this thing. 
"
Mike,"Sir? Sir, we have some... incredible news. There are rumors of hundreds of thousands of stolen ballots. You might have won the election after all. 
"
Stan,"There's nothing here, Kyle. 
"
Kyle,"Anything in the basement, Jimmy?
"
Jimmy,"Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
"
Kyle,"Well keep looking.
"
Liane,"Oh my goodness, what's going on?
"
Kyle,"Sorry Ms. Cartman, but your son took some things that didn't belong to him.
"
Liane,"Oh, I've told him to respect people's property. What did he take?
"
Stan,"He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
"
Liane,"Oh well, no TV for him for a few days.
"
Jimmy,"There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.
"
Stan,"Oh my God you guys, look!  Dude, it's Boba Fett's ship! 
"
Mickey Mouse,"Just what the Dickens is going on here, haha?!
"
Stan,"Aw shit, it's him again.
"
Mickey Mouse,"What's this about a deal with the Chinese?! I own all this shit now! I own the Death Star! I own Tatooine! It's all MINE, haha! All right fuckers, where are the missing ballots? Haha.
"
Cartman,"Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
"
Butters,"I didn't say anything. I promise.
"
Cartman,"I guess we learned that when it comes to Star Wars, we can't trust anyone. Not the President, not the Chinese, and not you.
"
Butters,"Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
"
Cartman,"Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.
"
Salesman,"Hey guys. Lookin' to buy a Hummer today?  We're havin' a Rocktober sales event day that's goin' into Rockvember.  Hey there! Interested in test-drivin' a Hummer today?  I can see you, with the Ray-Bans, got that nice bicep haning' out the window rolled down, whattaya think?  Rockvember sales event, guys! Every Hummer comes with a free Segway.
"
Café Monet diner,"Hey why don't you shut up?!
"
Salesman,"I'm just excited about all these deals, that's all. 
"
Storm Trooper,"We found him sir, but still no sign of the missing ballots.
"
Mickey Mouse,"Go on! Leave us alone! Haha.  Now listen, little boy, the reason this country works is because people go out to vote. Every vote counts. And you need-
"
Cartman,"Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
"
Mickey Mouse,"Why don't you just tell me where the missing ballots are?! It will make your death a lot less painful! Haha.
"
Cartman,"Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
"
Mickey Mouse,"Pretty neat, huh? How would you like to have one?
"
Cartman,"I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
"
Mickey Mouse,"Like what?!
"
Cartman,"I want a part in the new movies!
"
Mickey Mouse,"Well then, why didn't you just come to me in the first place? If you wanna be in the next Star Wars, I'm your guy! Haha.
"
Cartman,"I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
"
Mickey Mouse,"You can be Luke's son, you can be Han Solo's son, I don't give two shits and a popsicle.
"
Cartman,"Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
"
Mickey Mouse,"Sure thing. I've got tauntauns comin' out my asshole, haha.
"
Cartman,"Haha.
"
Mickey Mouse,"Haha.
"
Cartman,"Haha. 
"
Wolf Blitzer,"This is Breaking Election News. Hold that phone! The election may be over, but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for Mitt Romney were stolen!
"
Kyle,"We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
"
Field Reporter,"And and you claim that a General Tso hired your friend, Fatass, to steal the ballots, but so far the Chinese are refusing to speak with us.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. 
"
Field Reporter,"Is that it? Did he just? Did he just?
"
Wolf Blitzer,"Yup. Chris, we're getting confirmation that was the millionth time.
"
Chris,"Excitement and revelry at South Park as a little boy has just made the General Tso's chicken joke for the one millionth time. 
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Field Reporter,"Little boy, the General Tso's chicken joke, a favorite for years, you've just hit the magic number, how does it feel?
"
Kyle,"I... what? 
"
Field Reporter,"He's being presented with the check now, a five thousand dollar gift certificate to P.F. Chang's.  This has been a long campaign, but someone's finally done it, Wolf.
"
Stan,"Well, we tried, dude.
"
Kyle,"It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
"
Stan,"Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
"
Kyle,"It matters, Stan. It it matters.
"
A Santa,"Ho ho ho hoo!  Come on down to Stevenson Hummer for our big Christmas in Humvember Sale!  Not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season? Why not give them a nice Hummer? Nothing beats a Hummer on Christmas morning! 
"
Stan,"Stan, when was the last time you saw somebody drive a Hummer?
"
Stan,"Uhhh, forever ago, like, 2010?
"
Kyle,"Oh my God.
"
Mr. Stevenson,"Hey, looking for a Hummer today? Got some 2009s here. Never been driven. ...Ever.  Go on, get out of here! Shoo! 
"
Kyle,"Look! There they are!
"
Mr. Stevenson,"Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!
"
Kyle,"We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
"
Mr. Stevenson,"Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys!
"
General Tso,"Get out of our way!
"
Kyle,"No! These don't belong to you! They belong to the people!
"
General Tso,"I am tired of playing games! This little farce is ovah! 
"
Cartman,"I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 
"
Mr. Stevenson,"Oh my God it's a sales rush! 
"
Officer 2,"Oh my God. Are those what I think they are?
"
Cartman,"Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
"
Officer 3,"Sir, we've found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town.
"
General Tso,"You don't understand. We are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made!
"
Kyle,"Protect it?
"
Officer 4,"What the hell is going on here?!
"
Morgan Freeman,"Perhaps I can explain it to you.  You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted Star Wars is because they're afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard Star Wars' impeccable legacy.
"
Officer 5,"Is that Morgan Freeman?
"
Morgan Freeman,"And now we're at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep Star Wars from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, ""What's more important? That the right man is elected President, or that Star Wars is with people who will protect it most?"" 
"
An Officer,"Unit 4, what is it?! Over.
"
Officer 1,"Well kid?
"
Kyle,"Well... if you put it that way...
"
An Officer,"Come in Unite 4! What have you found?!
"
Officer 1,"Nothing sir. We just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants, that's all. Barkley out. 
"
Cartman,"No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
"
Group,"Obama is President again. 
"
Character,Line
Kyle,"I am sooo sick of that stupid bitch! Blabbin' pussy little skank! Why do people talk on their phone like that?! I can't even get a minute of piece before that bitch walks in, holding the cell phone out like this , and talking on speaker phone! Nobody wants to hear your goddamned conversations, you little bitch! You're not that important!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
"
Lawrence,"How many hours were you guys playing?
"
Cartman,"Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!""
"
Kyle,"AAAARGH!
"
Lawrence,"You were playing football?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
"
Kyle,"That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
"
Cartman,"Kyle, this is a private conversation.
"
Kyle,"Then take that shit off speaker phone!!
"
Lawrence,"Is that that same kid?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
"
Kyle,"How do we have a choice?!
"
Cartman,"Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
"
Lawrence,"Yeah yeah, you said that.
"
Toby,"My dad says the government keeps a database on everyone.
"
Cartman,"Who is that? Is that Toby
"
Toby,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
"
Toby,"Yeah, we're ditching school.
"
Cartman,"You're what? What, you say?
"
Lawrence,"Me and Toby are ditching school!
"
Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""?
"
Lawrence,"I don't think so.
"
Cartman,"See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 
"
Lawrence,"That'd be cool.
"
Cartman,"That'd be what?
"
Lawrence,"That'd be COOL.
"
Cartman,"I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?
"
Cartman,"Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
"
Lawrence,"I said I got your tweet and the address!
"
Cartman,"Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
"
Toby,"Yeah, I'm here, bro.
"
Cartman,"Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 
"
Kyle,"Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
"
Cartman,"Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
"
Butters,"Ww-ww-what's the N S A?
"
Cartman,"That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 
"
Butters,"The government watches everything we do?
"
Butters,"Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
"
Lawrence,"They're spying on you?
"
Cartman,"Yes, right here. I went to Amazon to see if they had Grand Theft Auto V, and it says, ""you might also be interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek."" I'm totally interested in the Blu-ray for Star Trek! How did they know that unless the government is keepin' tabs on mw?!  This is war, bro! Forget the rally, we have to go hard core!
"
Lawrence,"Like what?
"
Cartman,"Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
"
Lawrence,"Naw, don't do that.
"
Cartman,"No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
"
Lawrence,"You need that new thing where you don't need to type.
"
Cartman,"What, they already have something better than Twitter?
"
Lawrence,"You haven't seen the Alec Baldwin commercial?
"
Cartman,"No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
"
Alec Baldwin,"Hello. I'm Alec Baldwin, and I love social media.  But sometimes, I accidentally tweet things that are homophobic. I don't think that way, I just type that way. That's when I realized it wasn't me that was homophobic, it was my thumbs, and they needed to be gotten rid of.  So then the problem was, I don't have thumbs. But I know that everyone in America still wants to hear everything I have to say. Well, that's okay, because now there's a device that can actually take the thoughts in your head and send them directly to the Internet. It's called... Shitter. Wires are grafted harmlessly into your skull and any thought you have is uploaded to the Internet, and on to all your Shitter followers.  Don't let your social media slow down our need to communicate with the world. Go direct from thought to Internet ...with Shitter. 
"
Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
Clyde,"What's Shitter?
"
Stan,"Wow.
"
Kyle,"You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, because the government won't respect my privacy.
"
Clyde,"How many people are on Shitter?
"
Cartman,"Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
"
Butters,"Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
"
Clerk,"Next!
"
Butters,"Oh God, uh... but my parents always told me, ""If you do somethin' horrible, then you have to admit it to your protector, so that you can have forgiveness."" Are these people nice?
"
Man,"DMV people? They're the meanest people on planet Earth.
"
Butters,"Oh Jeez.  Oh God, huh... Here we go.  I yelled at a midget.  I was, I was watching MTV andand this little person was singing a song, eh - I think her name was ""Pink"" - but I I didn't like the songs and so I yelled! ""Hey, get off the TV you effing midget!""  And I, I was at Barnes & Noble with my mom, and while she was looking for a book I, I saw this picture of Jennifer Lawrence in a magazine. Um it and I, well, I cut the picture out of the magazine while no one was lookin'. Dirty whore! I took the picture home with me and I, and-I, I cut Jennifer Lawrence's mouth out with scissors and then I... well I put my wiener through the hole. I have no idea why!! How can I atone for it?! I already said the Pledge of Allegiance 50 times! And I sang ""My Country Tis Of Thee"" 100 times! And I watches ""America's Got Talent"" twice! What else can I do?
"
Clerk,"Why not a thousand ""Livin' In America""s?
"
Butters,"Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
"
Receptionist,"Can I help you sir?
"
Cartman,"Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
"
Receptionist,"All right, and your name?
"
Cartman,"Bill Clinton.
"
Receptionist,"I don't see you on the list, Mr. Clinton.
"
Cartman,"Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
"
Chief,"What have you got, Patricia?
"
Patricia,"Uh, this man says he has an interview for a job, sir?
"
Cartman,"I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
"
Cartman,"I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
"
Chief,"That's quite alright. The NSA needs all the help it can get. Come on upstairs and I'll show you around, see if you're fit for the job.
"
Pamphleteer,"Hello sir. My colleague and I are going through the neighborhood and seeing if you'd like to know the Truth. 
"
Butters,"Sure, I love the Truth.
"
Pamphleteer,"Okay, we from uh Jehovah Witness. We Kingdom Hall Jehovah Witness, and uh, we believe, sir, that uh many people interpret the Bible it wrong.
"
Butters,"Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
"
Pamphleteer,"We are, sir. We believe the, the Truth. I was once like you. I knew not what to believe, then I let my pulvy the Jehovah into the heart.
"
Butters,"Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
"
Pamphleteer,"Yes, because uh Jehovah will bring judgement against all who perish like the little girl will burn in fire.
"
Butters,"Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
"
Pamphleteer,"The government ih watching me?
"
Colleague,"Wansa?
"
Pamphleteer,"He said the government ih watching us. 
"
Colleague,"Hi now?
"
Pamphleteer,"How long they been watching us?
"
Butters,"Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
"
Pamphleteer,"I don't go to DMV. I don't have car.
"
Butters,"Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
"
Chief,"Right this way, Bill. Welcome to the NSA main office.
"
Cartman,"Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
"
Chief,"There's a lot of people working here at the NSA. Good people, people who just wanna keep America safe. Only problem is, checking all those e-mails, Twitter accounts, and surveilling all those phone calls can take a lot of manpower. 
"
Detective,"Hey Joe?
"
Joe,"Whatchoo got, Miller.
"
Miller,"Got a 24-year-old male in Albuquerque. He just e-mailed his wife and asked if she could go to the store after work. Then he called the fitness center to set up a membership. He liked the fitness center, so he tweeted his friends that they should try it out.
"
Joe,"...Alright, keep an eye on them. Let me know if anything changes. 
"
Miller,"Will do.
"
Joe,"It's a never-ending grind here at the NSA, and it seems there's never enough detectives to keep track of everyone.  Sergeant! What have you got, Larson.
"
Larson,"Got a seventeen-year-old female down in Jacksonville. She called her friend and asked her if she wanted to see the Percy Jackson movie. Then she e-mailed her mom at work and asked if it was okay. The mom said yes, but called her husband first to make sure there weren't any dinner plans.
"
Joe,"Alright, keep an eye on all three of them.
"
Larson,"Will do. 
"
Joe,"If you think you got the stomach for this, then we can definitely use your help, young man.
"
Detective,"Sir, you might wanna check this out.
"
Joe,"What have you got?
"
Detective,"Thirty-two-year-old pizza delivery man. He just put it on his Twitter account that he hates America and wants to blow up the Lincoln Memorial. 
"
Hippie,"Well well, the NSA. I should've known.
"
Joe,"We wanna talk to you about some tweets you've been tweeting.
"
Hippie,"Hey man, I was just blowin' smoke. Say, what right does the government have reading my private e-mails anyway?! Haven't you squares heard of the Constitution?
"
Joe,"Yeah, we've heard of that. We've also heard of the Declaration of Independence. See, there's a lot of people out there who think like you, people who think their government doesn't have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens. That is, until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life. You wanna live in the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, but the brave can't be free if the land isn't home, and that land won't be home so long as folks out there wanna take that American flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week, and as you're sittin' there on the toilet with the Star-Spangled Montezuma's Revenge there's one thing I can guarantee you.
"
Hippie,"Yeah? What's that?
"
Joe,"You won't care who's checkin' your Twitter account then. 
"
Hippie,"...I never thought of it that way.
"
Terrance,"Hey Phillip! Pull my finger!  Aaaahahahaha. 
"
Butters,"Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
Craig,"...The truth about what?
"
Butters,"We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
"
Craig,"...Aahhhh, no, I don't think so.
"
Pamphleteer,"My colleague and I, we went to saaah experience at DMV. We went to DMV, we admit all our shortcomings an sins and uh make a tital wave of peace and serenity with the truth stored inside our heart.
"
Craig,"...Okay. 
"
Butters,"You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
"
Craig,"Aaaaaaaaaaaahh, no.
"
Butters,"Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
"
Craig,"Your local DMV is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient.
"
Butters,"Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
"
Craig,"I have no idea.
"
Butters,"Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
"
Pamphleteer,"Yes sir.  See, i used to be like you. I go around sending them nasty e-mails and a nasty texts, puttin' nasty picture on my nasty Facebook. But then I realized, all these things, they live forever, because the government keep a file on us. So all that live forever up in what they call the Clou'. It's a government term. If they could put a file in the Clou', then I wanna make sure I come clean about the bad ones and maybe get those things off my record off the Clou'. Because we all live forever in the Clou'.
"
Butters,"Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
"
Date,"What is that voice?
"
Alec Baldwin,"Some little faggot in my head.
"
Cartman,"Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
"
Detective 3,"Pretty simple. Everyone has a file. People who have a status of ""threat"", ""possible threat"", or ""person of interest"" are the ones we really wanna look at.
"
Detective 4,"The more we pay attention to them, the bigger their file becomes.
"
Cartman,"Really? How big is my file?
"
Detective 4,"Huh?
"
Cartman,"Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
"
Detective 3,"Jarvis, what have we got on an ""Eric Cartman""? Any files on Eric Cartman.
"
Jarvis,"Ohhh yeah, we tracked him for a little bit, but Central Computer designated his status as ""fat and unimportant.""
"
Cartman,"Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet.""  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
"
Barbrady,"And that's when I masturbated to Game of Thrones. I know it was wrong to masturbate, and I know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty.
"
Clerk 2,"What the?  Why do these people keep coming here?
"
Barbrady,"But I am done forever with Game of Thrones. Forever
"
Clerk 2,"Next, please! 
"
Barbrady,"Thank you. 
"
Group,"Yaaaaaay.
"
Butters,"Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
"
Barbrady,"I, I feel really good.
"
Group,"Heehhhhhhhah. 
"
Customer,"Wow, those people over there seem like they're havin' fun. 
"
Butters,"I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
"
Group,"To the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
"
Larry,"What the hell is going on here?! This is the DMV! There will be no joy here!
"
Clerk 3,"Uh people keep showing up and telling us what they did wrong.
"
Customer 2,"Hey, I'm just trying to renew my license. How much longer do I gotta wait? 
"
Larry,"Shut up! Sit there and wait, and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously! I'll put a stop to this! 
"
Cartman,"Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
"
Chief Joe,"Not according to the Central Computer.
"
Cartman,"The Central Computer is wrong! You need to change his status!
"
Chief Joe,"Sorry,  but if Central Computer says he is not a threat, then we can't do anything. 
"
Cartman,"Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
"
Chief Joe,"There's 300 million people out there. How do you think we're able to keep track of every single person in the country? How do you think we're able to really know who's doing what?
"
Cartman,"I don't know.
"
Chief Joe,"Alright, I'll show you. But this is very top security stuff, because if people knew how we did it, then everyone would do it. Then our enemies would do it. We can't let our enemies get their hands on this.
"
Cartman,"Get their hands on what?  Dude... 
"
Chief Joe,"This is how we know who's a threat and who's not. How we know who's sleeping and who's awake.  How we know that...
"
Cartman,"You think I'm fat and unimportant now?!  I AM Eric Cartman! And I've got news for you! This is all being broadcast LIVE on my Twitter Zeppelin, and on Alec Baldwin's new television show, via Shitter!
"
Alec Baldwin,"Hi everybody, and welcome to my new show on MSNBC, ""Free Pass with Alec Baldwin""
"
Cartman,"You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
"
Liane,"Eric, honey, what's the matter?
"
Cartman,"It didn't work, Mom! I infiltrated the NSA, and I was a whistleblower and I thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government, but nobody cared! Nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything! Nobody cares if Santa Claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine!
"
Liane,"I know that the NSA is torturing Santa, sweetie. But they're keeping us safe.
"
Cartman,"Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 
"
Liane,"Honey, it's okay.
"
Cartman,"It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! 
"
Liane,"No, you don't have to fly to Russia, hon.
"
Cartman,"I do toooo!
"
Liane,"No, it will be fine. How about I make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine?
"
Cartman,"Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
"
Liane,"Okay, hon.
"
Butters,"Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
Cartman,"...The fuck are you talking about, Butters?
"
Butters,"It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
"
Cartman,"It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
"
Butters,"It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
"
Cartman,"What's this?
"
Butters,"Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
"
Cartman,"I can be forgiven?
"
Butters,"Yes.
"
Cartman,"For everything bad I've ever done?
"
Butters,"Yes!
"
Cartman,"And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
"
Butters,"That's right.
"
Cartman,"Thta's pretty kewl.
"
Butters,"We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
"
Cartman,"I do, I love my country!
"
Butters,"Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
"
Cartman,"I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
"
Butters,"Hallelujah!
"
Group,"Yaaaaay!
"
Paul,"Do you want us to kick them out of here, Lar?
"
Larry,"No... No, leave them alone. It's a nice change to see people happy here at the DMV.  Perhaps we here at the DMV can start changing as well. Perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope. Why, the DMV can be a place where people come to get things off their chests. Confess, yes, but also be told that they're worth something in this world! And then, DMVs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe. And when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness! Don't you see what this could lead to? Don't you see what we could become??
"
News Anchor,"The DMV was shut down today after rampant allegations of sex with young boys.  The heads of the DMV were arrested and the director stated, quote: Hey, it came with the territory. With the DMV shut down, Americans have been asked to confess all wrongdoings at their nearest post office.  We've just received word that the US Postal service has been shut down due to rampant allegations of sex with young boys. It now appears that the only people who can be trusted with confessions and guidance is your local news station. WMZ News will be back in... a young boy.

Wendy,"Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
"
Cartman,"Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
"
Wendy,"Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
"
Cartman,"Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
"
Wendy,"The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
"
Cartman,"Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!
"
Wendy,"Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
"
Cartman,"I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
"
Wendy,"Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?  Mr. Garrison?!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Huh? Oh, oh, Wendy, uhhh, very nicely done. Thank you. Okay, next report,  let's have uh, Peter Mullen.
"
Wendy,"Ugh, Jesus! 
"
Peter,"My report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television. Fellow students: there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes!  Shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide!  I'm talking of course about  murder porn!
"
Butters,"Murder porn?
"
Cartman,"That's more like it.
"
Peter,"According to the Nielsen ratings, viewership in shows like ""Cold Case Files,"" ""Dateline: Murder,"" and ""Deadly Affairs"" is skyrocketing amongst married couples. The increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex, and innuendo, to make spousal murder more titillating. Shows like ""Southern Fried Homicide,"" ""Sinful Secrets,"" ""On The Case with Paula Zahn."" And it's all smut and it's garbage and it's  trash!  Your parents are watching this stuff! Go home and ask them! And as we ask them we must also ask ourselves, ""If they're obsessed with this stuff, then how long? How long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes Mommy's head in with a brick?"" 
"
Randy,"Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 
"
Narrator,"His wife is having sex with the neighbor.  And when her husband comes home,  he wants more than just a divorce. 
"
Stan,"You guys are watchin' murder porn?
"
Randy,"...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
"
Sharon,"Uh adults like documentaries.
"
Randy,"Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
"
Stan,"Okaaay. 
"
Randy,"Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
"
Stan,"What's up dude?
"
Cartman,"Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
"
Stan,"Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
"
Cartman,"You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
"
Stan,"...What?!
"
Sergeant Yates,"Hey that kid should not be seeing this! 
"
Stan,"What happened?
"
Dad,"You're making a mistake!  Let me go! It wasn't me, I tell ya! A burglar broke in! He was black! He's the one who stabbed that nagging bitch in her fat face! He was blaaack! 
"
Kyle,"Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
"
Red,"How is this stuff allowed to stay on the air?!
"
Clyde,"The police found hours and hours of murder porn on the Hagens' DVR. What more proof do we need?!
"
Butters,"I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
"
Wendy,"This is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals!
"
Cartman,"Boooooooooo. Boooo Wendy Testaburger! Boo!
"
Kyle,"Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
"
Narrator,"Tonight at 10, it's a tale of lust, seduction, and murder, on Sexy Betrayals.  Then at 7, some like their murder with a side of sexy biscuits,  on Southern Fried Homicide. But now, get ready for lust, betrayal and murder,  on Hot Load Case Files. 
"
Randy,"Oh yeah!  Three of the best shows in a row!
"
Sharon,"Is the lube over there?
"
Randy,"Yeah, I got lube right here.
"
Sharon,"Well get over here, big guy.
"
Randy,"Yeah-hah! 
"
Randy,"What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says ""How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?"" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
"
Randy,"Stan. Stan!  How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?
"
Stan,"What?
"
Randy,"What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
"
Stan,"You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
"
Randy,"Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! 
"
Stephen,"Who do out children think they are?! Blocking our TV content?!
"
Mrs. Tweak,"How are they able to do this with their smartphones?
"
Randy,"It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
"
Stuart,"No, they just did their usual cable-company runaround.
"
Randy,"What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
"
Cable Guy,"I'm sorry sir. If you need it now, perhaps you should switch to another cable company.  Ohhh there's not another cable company, is there?  Ohhh, that's right, we're the only one in town.
"
Randy,"Look, if our kids can block content, then you must be able to block them!
"
Cable Guy,"As we told the others, sir, we can fix it. We just need to send a technician out to your house to change out your cable box.
"
Randy,"Oh. Well okay, great.
"
Cable Guy,"We'll just need to find a window of time you can be home... How about between the hours of 6 am and 3 pm all of November?
"
Randy,"NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
"
Cable Guy,"Oh, you can't?  Jeez that's too bad. You need to be home for the technician. Have you thought of switching to DirecTV?
"
Randy,"I can't afford DirecTV.
"
Cable Guy,"Oh, you can't?  Jeez, that's terrible. Then I guess you just have to work within our time windows. 
"
Stephen,"Well? Any luck?
"
Randy,"No, just the usual cable-company stuff.
"
Mrs. Tweak,"Oh well, guess we'll just have to live without our informative crime drama.
"
Stephen,"No, screw that! Can't we just learn this Minecraft game so we can get around our kids' parental lock?
"
Randy,"I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
"
Stephen,"We can learn, Randy. There's talk of a child. Word is he will teach Minecraft to anybody for the right price.
"
Boy,"Hello?
"
Randy,"Hi. Corey Lanskin?
"
Corey,"Yes?
"
Randy,"We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
"
Corey,"Fuck off! 
"
Randy,"Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!
"
Corey,"You was told wrong, mistuh! I'm just a simple kid with a simple passion for simple things!
"
Randy,"We have a hundred ounces of silver. 
"
Corey,"Wipe your feet and turn off your cell phones. 
"
Corey,"Next we're going to select an empty world. Selecting an empty world will begin with you being dropped onto a beach. Now you're free to roam around and start punching trees!
"
Gerald,"Punching trees?
"
Randy,"Why, why would we punch trees?
"
Corey,"Just use your fucking brain! How do you get wood?  'Ow do you get wood?!
"
Randy,"Watching informative murder porn?
"
Corey,"NOO NOO, in this Minecraft forest, how do you get wood?!
"
Randy,"Puh, punching trees?
"
Corey,"Riiight. You punch the trees to get the wood, you get the wood to build a cabin.
"
Randy,"Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
"
Corey,"You are playing the game; this is the game!
"
Randy,"...I don't get it.
"
Corey,"That's because you're thinkin' like a dad. Minecraft, it don't got no winner. It don't got no objective. You just fuckin' build an' shit. And seein' if other things can come and knock it down. Now, let's click on the inventory, and let's filter through the skin!
"
Randy,"Yes ah, I'm getting it now.
"
Gerald,"You are?
"
Randy,"No.
"
Sharon,"Randy, it's getting late. Let's just go to sleep.
"
Randy,"I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
"
Sharon,"I'm really not in the mood now anyway.
"
Randy,"Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
"
Sharon,"We don't have to have sex for our relationship to be good.
"
Randy,"No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
"
Sharon,"Well I'm going to sleep, Randy.
"
Randy,"Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
"
Jimmy,"There he is. Hey Kyle!  The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
"
Kyle,"What? How do you know?
"
Tweek,"I caught my parents over at Bebe's house watching Sunsets of Homicide. But Bebe got the lock from the cable company!
"
Craig,"It's true. I walked in on my parents watching Marital Murder Mayhem. They broke the parental lock somehow.
"
Stan,"That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
"
Cartman,"You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here.
"
Stan,"What?
"
Cartman,"Butters' dad killed his mom. 
"
Stan,"Butters, what happened?
"
Butters,"I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell!
"
Stan,"Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?
"
Butters,"Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Butters, your dad threw you down a well?
"
Stan,"In Minecraft.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well what the hell is that?
"
Butters,"I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
"
Kyle,"That's it.  That's how our parents broke the passcode. I never thought anyone would stoop so low!
"
Stan,"Whattaya mean?
"
Kyle,"Someone is teaching our parents Minecraft. 
"
Randy,"Yes?
"
Officer 1,"Hello sir, had a little incident last night, wondering if you saw or heard anything?
"
Randy,"No, what happened?
"
Officer 1,"Well, someone broke into your next door neighbor's back yard and they... dug up a bunch of holes and punched his trees.
"
Randy,"Punched his trees, huh?
"
Officer 1,"Yes sir. Then we got a house across the street where someone dug up the yard and... built a cabin.
"
Randy,"Huh.  That's weird.
"
Officer 1,"What were you doing last night?
"
Randy,"I was just playing Mi- mmmmuh... my banjo.
"
Officer 2,"I play the banjo too.
"
Officer 1,"Well, thanks for your time sir. You might wanna keep the lights on in your yard tonight in case someone tries to build a cabin on it as well.
"
Randy,"Will do, officer. Will... do... 
"
Kyle,"Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
"
Cartman,"Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! 
"
Craig,"I spent three hours last night trying to get Tweek's parents to stop griefing my castle! When I finally got away from them, I found they had taken all my dandelions!
"
Clyde,"Why did we agree to that stupid app?!
"
Kyle,"You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
"
Cartman,"And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
"
Wendy,"I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
"
Cartman,"Boooooo! Boo Wendy, boooo.
"
Stan,"It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
"
Officer 3,"All right, that's enough. Come on out and there won't be any trouble.  Give it up, Stotch. You've nowhere to run.
"
Butters,"Huh?
"
Stephen,"I'll never give up!  I don't even remember doing this! Just leave me alone!
"
Randy,"Huhuh. Oh nice one, Stotch! Your castle fuckin' sucks!
"
Stephen,"Aw, go to hell, you griefer!
"
Cartman,"Alright, we've gotta do something.
"
Corey,"Hello?
"
Kyle,"Corey Lanskin?
"
Corey,"Eh yes?
"
Kyle,"We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
"
Corey,"Whaaa? What's a, what's a ""Minequaf""?
"
Stan,"Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
"
Corey,"Oh no, please don't be angry. My mommy's always angry. ""Get back in the meat locker!"" ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!"" But she loves me, right? Mommy loves me?
"
Kyle,"Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
"
Corey,"Ohhhkay.  Bye. 
"
Stan,"What, dude?
"
Cartman,"Something he said. Did you hear him? He said ""Ouchie ouchie Mommy raped my nono!""
"
Stan,"So?
"
Cartman,"You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
"
Corey,"Now that you've built a workbench it's time to build somethin' that will take care of all those fuckin' sheep!  Just stop thinkin' with your grown-up brains and start usin' your-
"
Stan,"Aha! 
"
Corey,"Oh shit! 
"
Kenny,"(I knew you're up to something!)
"
Cartman,"Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
"
Corey,"Kids gotta find some way to make a livin', don't 'e?
"
Stan,"You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
"
Corey,"What? You mean like Investigation Discovery?
"
Kyle,"So you know it.
"
Corey,"Yeah, I've seen that stuff.  ""'Oo The Bleep Did I Marry?"", ""True Crime with Aphrodite Jones"". Real sick shit. Your parents watch that stuff?
"
Kyle,"We put a stop to it, until YOU taught them Minecraft.
"
Corey,"Your problem ain't with me, mates. Sure, one or two people might act out what they see in video games, but cable television?  People copy everything they see people do on cable. You're goin' about this all wrong. You wanna protect your family? You're gonna have to go fight the cable company.
"
Cable Guy,"Hey guys, can I help you?
"
Kyle,"Hello. There are certain networks that we see as harmful to our families, and we want them removed, please.
"
Cable Guy,"Ohhh, you don't want cable anymore?
"
Stan,"No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
"
Cable Guy,"You don't like paying for all the channels?  Ohh, our company actually packages channels together.
"
Stan,"Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
"
Cable Guy,"Oh I'm sorry. Our company doesn't work that way.  You want me to give you the number of a different cable company that can-  Oh wait, we're it, aren't we?  Dangit, I guess you have to deal with our packages.
"
Kyle,"Can we talk to your supervisor please?!
"
Cable Guy,"Oh, sure. Hey David?
"
David,"Hi, is there a problem here? 
"
Stan,"We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
"
David,"Ohhh you have to pay for the bundle. You can't just pay for what you wanna watch. Darn it.
"
Kyle,"You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
"
Cable Guy,"I guess if you don't wanna be forced to pay for Oprah, you're gonna have to shut off your cable altogether.
"
Kyle,"Fine,  then we'll shut our cable off altogether!
"
David,"Hey Mitch? When can you get out to shut off some cable boxes?
"
Mitch,"Oh man, it's gonna be like three weeks. There's a whole plug I have to pull out; it's like four inches long.
"
David,"Three weeks, huh? Okay, is three weeks from now okay with you guys?
"
Stan,"No, that's way too long!
"
Cable Guy,"Oh it is?
"
David,"Oh Jeez, that's terrible.
"
Stan,"Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
"
David,"Say... say that last part again?
"
Stan,"What?
"
David,"Well what was the last part you said?
"
Stan,"I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
"
David,"Nono, the part about your parents not getting the channels easily?
"
Stan,"I... said it would really bum them out.
"
David,"How...  How much would it bum them out?
"
Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by for an important message from the president of your local cable company.
"
President,"Hello. In an effort to comfort the anguished cries or children everywhere, your local cable company has decided to drop all networks that sexualize spousal homicides from regular programming. Customers still wishing to view true-crime networks will now need to purchase a separate package  which will require a technician to service your cable box every night from 2 to 3 am. and must include the purchase of 300 channels in Portuguese. We realize this may be an inconvenience to you, and we hope you will voice ALL your concerns to us, because at your local cable company the customer is always... our bitch.
"
Randy,"Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
"
Stan,"Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
"
Randy,"I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.
"
Randy,"Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. 
"
Sharon,"No, you'r right, Randy. Without any sex we just seem to get madder and madder at each other.
"
Randy,"No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
"
Randy,"Sharon? Heh, hey Sharon, are you here?
"
Sharon,"I'm here, Randy.
"
Randy,"It's beautiful, isn't it? Come on ever here, I built us a fire. Look what I got you. 
"
Sharon,"Diamonds.  They're beautiful
"
Randy,"Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
"
Sharon,"I've got a surprise for you too, Randy.
"
Randy,"Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
"
Sharon,"Sorry. I couldn't resist.
"
Randy,"Jesus, you stuck a pick axe right in my skull!
"
Sharon,"Oh I did! That felt really great.
"
Randy,"Felt great?
"
Sharon,"Yeah...
"
Randy,"Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
"
Sharon,"Okay.  Oh my God, you put that sword right through my face!
"
Randy,"That felt so good!
"
Sharon,"My turn again.
"
Randy,"Okay, hang on.
"
Sharon,"I've always thought about murdering you in your sleep. Can you go to the cabin and get in bed?
"
Randy,"Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.
"
Sharon,"You lazy jerk! You never do anything around the house! 
"
Randy,"OH! Ohoho, you bitch!  Ohohunh.
"
Sharon,"Oh I love you, Randy.
"
Randy,"I love you too babe.  OH!
"
Cartman,"Hey Token!  What's up, bro?
"
Token,"Nothing.
"
Cartman,"""Nothin'"" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?
"
Token,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
"
Jimmy,"Uh, I'm just gettin' ready for cla-
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 
"
Stan,"Is he doing it again?
"
Kyle,"He's doing it a-gain.
"
Cartman,"Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 
"
Token,"I uhhh, have band practice.
"
Cartman,"God you are sooo cool. Alright bro, I'll catch you at recess.  Fist bump. Fist bump, bro. 
"
Stan,"Cartman, are you feeling alright?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? 
"
Herbert Garrison,"Alright, now the French Revolution was basically started by a young man named Marius. , who only knew Jean Valjean as an older man, and uh-  ...uh, the French government at the time was led by Javert, who was trying to-
"
Cartman,"Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
"
Cartman,"It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
"
Mr. Mackey,"And why do you think Token is a tickin' time bomb?
"
Cartman,"He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
"
Cartman,"But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?
"
Cartman,"No, it's too gay. It would only make things worse.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?
"
Cartman,"M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
"
Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.
"
Cartman,"M'kay.
"
Cartman,"No, Token! Leave Brad Pitt alone! Brad Pitt is fighting zombies! No ah Token, Token!
"
Karin,"Eat your breakfast, girls. 
"
Rachel,"Where's Daddy?
"
Karin,You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry.
Rachel,"Daddy!
"
Gerry,"Good morning, girls.  Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. 
"
Karin,"How did I get such a perfect husband?
"
Gerry,"How did I get such a beautiful wife?
"
Rachel,"I love you, Dad.
"
Gerry,"I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
"
Karin,"Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
"
Reporter,"Today apparently will be the day! CNN has just received word that a verdict in the George Zimmerman trial is expected to come at any moment! Zimmerman is accused of shooting Trayvon Martin, and a jury will now decide his fate.
"
Constance,"Daddy, who is Trayvon Martin?
"
Gerry,"Nobody. L-let's just get you girls to school.
"
Gerry,"Is it bigger than a bread box?
"
Rachel,"What's a bread box, Dad?
"
Constance,"Heehee, Dad is so kewl.
"
Karin,"You can say that again.
"
Gerry,"Why aren't we moving? What's gong on? 
"
Reporter,"We interrupt this cool song for a news bulletin. A verdict has just been handed down in the case of George Zimmerman. In a shocking turn of events, the jury has found George Zimmerman not guilty!
"
Gerry,"Oh my God. 
"
Reporter,"Many African-Americans are outraged by the verdict, and they are most likely about to go totally nanners. 
"
Gerry,"AAAAAH!
"
Protester,"Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
"
Gerry,"Let's bail!  Everyone get out of the car! Go!  Oh my god RUN!  WAAH! Token. No, Token, we had nothing to do with this. I know you're pissed off, but but be reasonable!
"
Token,"Fuck you, Brad Pitt!
"
Gerry,"No! Nonono!  Nooo! 
"
Cartman,"Hey Token? How are you doing?
"
Token,"I'm good.
"
Cartman,"That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 
"
Cartman,"No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
"
Token,"Okay, really?
"
Cartman,"No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Now Eric, whatever it is you and Token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?
"
Cartman,"Agreed.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Token, come on in, please. 
"
Cartman,"Hoh boy, here we go.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Token, I've been talkin' with Eric and he's really upset that you two aren't gettin' along. You have some things you wanna say, Eric?
"
Cartman,"Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
"
Token,"...What jury?
"
Cartman,"This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay Token, what are your feelings about that?
"
Token,"I don't know what to say.
"
Cartman,"I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?""
I was not the verdict.
"
Token,"This isn't a poem. It doesn't even rhyme.
"
Cartman,"It's going to rhyme, Token, just hold on.
I was not the shooter. I was not the gun.
So Token, you should be cool while we're all here at school.
"
Token,"Can I go back to class now?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric, do you feel better about all this?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, thanks Token. 
"
Cartman,"It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
"
Cheerleaders,"We are Cows, proud and true! Come on, South Park, moo moo moo! Goooo Cows!
"
Principal Victoria,"Ooookay, thank you, cheerleaders. That was very nice. Ahhh, next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song,  based on his award-winning poem, ""I Was Not The Bullet,"" with backup music by Butters Stotch. 
"
Cartman (Butters),"Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the jury, so don't blame me, son!
James my man was wrong (It's not our fault). James my man was wrong (It's not Eric's fault).
Black or white, it's alright. Black or white, let's not fight.
White people say Ho-oh!
"
The kids,"Ho-oh.
"
Cartman,"Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
"
The kids,"Ho ho!
"
Cartman,"Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say ""I don't blame the white people. No no no!""
"
Token,"Alright, that's enough!  You think I should feel bad for you because of the Trayvon Martin verdict?!
"
Cartman,"Token, calm down.
"
Token,"What the hell is wrong with you?! Why are you all here listening to this?!
"
Cartman,"Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
"
Cartman,"Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! 
"
Woman,"Does that little boy have a gun?
"
Man,"Get inside. 
"
Woman,"But-
"
Man,"Get inside! 
"
Cartman,"Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
"
Driver,"What's going on?!
"
Cartman,"Get to an airport!
"
Driver,"An airport?! But...?
"
Cartman,"We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! 
"
Announcer,"Now calling rows 10 through 30 for boarding.
"
Cartman,"The outbreak has started! We've gotta get the fuck out of here! 
"
Passenger 1,"An outbreak? 
"
Passenger 2,"Which one?
"
Cartman,"Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 
"
Pilot,"My God, what's going on out there?
"
Cartman,"The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! 
"
Copilot,"Maybe now you can tell us what the hell is going on?!
"
Cartman,"The e-... The end of the world? We've got one shot and one shot only and that's to find a place where the contagion won't reach us!
"
Passenger 3,"What contagion? My wife didn't get on the plane.  Take this plane back to Denver!
"
Cartman,"You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! 
"
Captain,"Alright what the hell is going on here?!
"
Worker 1,"We don't know anything. First there was talk of a hijacking, then reports of an outbreak of some kind.
"
Worker 2,"Confirmed report of panic in a rural town in the Colorado Rockies!
"
Worker 3,"Sir, the pilot of flight 82 wants an update. They're asking permission to land.
"
Captain,"Stall them. I don't want that plane landing anywhere until we know what the hell we're dealing with!
"
Worker 4,"Sir, you'd better look at this. This was found in the airport lavatory. It seems to be a survival guide of some kind.
"
Captain,"Survival of what?
"
Worker 4,"From the looks of it, a contagion outbreak of the worst kind. 
"
Captain,"Oh my God.
"
Pilot,"DA43 to tower, please advise!  Damnit! They aren't telling me anything!
"
Copilot,"Do you think it's a virus?
"
Pilot,"Virus, bacteria, either way we're all dead! Find out if he thinks it's safe to land in Los Angeles.
"
Copilot,"What about Los Angeles? Can we take the plane to Los Angeles?
"
Cartman,"Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 
"
Copilot,"This plane won't make it to Iceland!
"
Passenger 3,"You got a better idea, asshole?!
"
Cartman,"Everyone quiet! I have to think!
"
Driver,"Yes, let him think!
"
Cartman,"I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
"
Occupant,"Oh, I'm just finishing up.
"
Cartman,"Nah! 
"
Occupant,"Hey!
"
Cartman,"One of them is in the back!
"
Driver,"What?!
"
Passenger 3,"What do you mean?!
"
Copilot,"Everyone just calm down! We have to stay in control! 
"
Passenger 4,"I won't become one of them! 
"
Copilot,"Shoot it! 
"
Girls,"Engine engine #9 running down Chicago Line, if the train should jump the track do you want your money back? 
"
Butters,"Yes.
"
Girls,"Y-E-S spells yes- 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.
"
Token,"He's just out looking for trouble.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well that's your side of it, Token, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel.  You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Token, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?
"
Driver,"No, the plane crashed. We're in the Colorado mountains somewhere.  Matt? Matt?!  My husband. He said the outbreak was all over the news, but everything was totally fine where he was.
"
Cartman,"Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
"
Pilot,"Help! Help me!  Please, I have two little girls in Chicago. Please find them!
"
Cartman,"It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
"
Pilot,"Then you have to stop it.
"
Driver,"Yes!
"
Pilot,"And there must be... a Patient Zero... The person it all starts from.
"
Cartman,"His name is Token.
"
Driver,"We have to kill him, before he infects everyone else!
"
Cartman,"I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
"
Pilot,"You have to! You have to be strong. If you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it.  Promise me! Promise... me!
"
Cartman,"Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
"
Pilot,"Thank you-wait, what? 
"
Driver,"Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
Cartman,"We're gonna live through this! Do you hear me?!
"
Driver,"Yes!
"
Cartman,"Come on! 
"
Reporter,"First, a wave of 911 calls about a virus, and now a plane has apparently gone down in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Is this the beginning of the end?
"
Butters,"Oh boy! Zombie apocalypse!
"
Reporter,"The government is looking for a Patient Zero, going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airport.
Anyone with information regarding Patient Zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately.
"
Butters,"Holy Moly.
"
Jimbo,"Can I help you?
"
Cartman,"Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
"
Jimbo,"Alright, you want a rifle!  well, like this .22 caliber.  What is it you intend to shoot?
"
Cartman,"A person. 
"
Jimbo,"...You mean a person who's threatening you?
"
Cartman,"Threatening all of us!
"
Driver,"Please, please hurry! It's important!
"
Jimbo,"Well, you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you.
"
Cartman,"What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
"
Jimbo,"You can't shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street. Well unless of course you're in a state that has a ""stand your ground"" law.
"
Cartman,"Stand my ground?
"
Driver,"Please! We're running out of time!
"
Jimbo,"See now with a ""stand your ground"" law, you could legally shoot somebody that's threatening you whether they're in your house or not.
"
Cartman,"Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
"
Jimbo,"No, no, see, you've gotta be IN a state with a ""stand your ground"" law, like Florida.
"
Cartman,"This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
"
Jimbo,"So long as they're threatening you.
"
Driver,"What?! What is it, please?! Hurry, my husband might still be alive!
"
Cartman,"The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
"
Cartman,"Let's go, let's go! Let's move move move move! Let's go!
"
Flight Attendant,"This plane is going to Baltimore.
"
Cartman,"If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
"
Cartman,"Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. 
"
Driver,"What are we going to do?
"
Cartman,"I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
"
Driver,"What if he attacks us first?
"
Cartman,"Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
"
Driver,"I haven't had the time to thank you, for doing what you've d- 
"
Mom,"Eat your breakfast, girls. 
"
Older Daughter,"Where's Daddy?
"
Mom,"You can eat without your father in the room. Now hurry. 
"
Older Daughter,"Daddy!
"
George Zimmerman,"Good morning, girls.  Save Daddy any pancakes? Look at that? Six A.M. and my family is already smiling. 
"
Mom,"How did I get such a perfect husband, Geroge Zimmerman?
"
George Zimmerman,"And how did I get such a beautiful wife?
"
Older Daughter,"I love you, Dad.
"
George Zimmerman,"I love you too, Princess. I love both of you, equally.
"
Mom,"Nothing can ever go wrong, so long as we all have each other.
"
Reporter,"Is there any hope for stopping the zombie apocalypse?  CNN has just received word that the government has learned the identity of Patient Zero.  The nine year old threat to humanity has been tracked down, and measures are being taken to stop him.
"
Younger Daughter,"Daddy, what's a Patient Zero? 
"
Agent 1,"Hello, Mr. Zimmerman. Your country needs you.
"
George Zimmerman,"What do you need from me?
"
Agent 1,"We...  need you to shoot a young African-American for us.
"
George Zimmerman,"I gave that up.
"
Agent 2,"You're the best, Zimmerman. We just need you to do it one more time, for the security of the world!
"
George Zimmerman,"Damnit, I have a wife and kids now.
"
Agent 1,"Then do it for your family!  This is about protecting people, Zimmerman! Keeping our streets safe so that our children are free to go out... 
"
George Zimmerman,"Something's wrong.  Look out! 
"
Agent 1,"My God, I didn't even see him. 
"
Agent 2,"Nice work, Zimmerman. 
"
George Zimmerman,"Are you guys okay?
"
Older Daughter,"What was that, Daddy?
"
George Zimmerman,"More needless violence.
"
Agent 1,"Nonsense, you did what you had to. You're a hero.
"
George Zimmerman,"That may be true, but I'll have to live with this the rest of my life. Even though I'll be walking around a free man.
"
Agent 2,"Hey, wait a minute. This kid isn't black, he's white.
"
George Zimmerman,"Wait, what?
"
Judge,"Guilty!
"
Reporter,"The zombie apocalypse... is over. All the panic, crashing planes and chaos appear to have, for some reason, died with George Zimmerman. And as for the little boy who was so mercilessly gunned down?  Although he survived the shooting, his wishes are to remain anonymous, giving the hospital only the nickname... ""Brad Pitt."" ...But cooler.
"
Stan,"That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, that sucked.
"
Butters,"Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
"
Cartman,"Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
"
Token,"You made everyone think I'm a fucking Patient Zero!
"
Cartman,"Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
"
Token,"So what?!
"
Cartman,"Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
"
Token,"Fuck you!
"
Cartman,"Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. 
"
Token,"Oh! 
"
Cartman,"That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. 
"
Gerry's Daughters,"Daddy!
"
Gerry,"What's up girls? Daddy did it!
"
Cartman,"Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
"
Kyle,"You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
"
Cartman,"Yeah. So bad.
"
Kyle,"That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
"
Cartman,"Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"You're a murderer.
"
Cartman,"You interrupt people when they talk.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric Cartman to the counselor's office please.
"
Cartman,"Oh man! 
"
Cartman,"Oh boy.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Have a seat, Eric. Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you're having, okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or you're gettin' detention!
"
Token,"An apology?! He shot me!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well he was technically standing his ground, Token.
"
Cartman,"Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
"
Token,"Well it's a pretty fucking stupid law!
"
Cartman,"Token, calm down.
"
Token,"And why does standing your ground not apply to fucking white people?!
"
Cartman,"Oh God, here we go again! 
"
"A singer, Goth Kids (singing)","(South Park Theme#Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers Lyrics)
"
Henrietta,"So I cast my body into the trails of blood.
The knife pierces deep, deep into my lonely eyes.
So I can see this black world... no more.
"
Pete,"Whoa... That's pretty hardcore. 
"
Michael,"That's real pain right there. 
"
Henrietta,"That's how I feel, when my mother abuses me. I just wanna escape, to she can't hurt me anymore. 
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Henrietta, sweetie.
"
Henrietta,"Shut up, Mom! Go away!
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Oh, but remember, Daddy wanted to talk to you in the living room, my dark little princess.
"
Henrietta,"Stop calling me a princess! I'm not a beauty queen in a Disney movie!
"
Mrs. Biggle,"We'll be waiting in the living room.
"
Henrietta,"God, she just never stops!
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Oh goodness I am so nervous. 
"
Henrietta,"What?!
"
Mr. Biggle,"Have a seat, Henrietta. 
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Oh, a little family chit-chaaat.
"
Henrietta,"Shut up, Mom!
"
Mr. Biggle,"Henrietta, as you know, your mother and I have been concerned about your behavior for some time.
"
Henrietta,"Are we really doing this again?!
"
Mr. Biggle,"We've had a hard time coping with the dark things you're into, but we've finally had some counseling, and apparently we're not the only parents who have a child that is... emo.
"
Henrietta,"What?!
"
Mrs. Biggle,"But Daddy and I love our little muffin, even if she's emo or not.
"
Henrietta,"I'm not a fucking emo! Don't you even know the fucking diff!
"
Mr. Biggle,"Do you know how your foul language breaks your mother's heart?
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Like calling Mommy Demon Jizz.
"
Mr. Biggle,"So listen, sweetie, we've found a camp. 
"
Henrietta,"Noo...
"
Mr. Biggle,"A camp which is for troubled kids like you, and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility.
"
Henrietta,"I'm not going to any fucking camp!
"
Mr. Biggle,"It's for two weeks, and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges.
"
Henrietta,"I won't come back because I'll be fucking dead. I'll walk out of that camp and I'll walk the streets until I probably get picked up and gangbanged by criminals until I'm bleeding out my fucking eyes!!
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Theeeey have a horseshoe pit where you can challenge the other kids to horsehoooes.
"
Pete,"And that's all you know? what else did she say?
"
Michael,"She said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks.
"
Pete,"Oh my God, for two weeks?
"
Firkle,"Is she at the camp now?
"
Michael,"I don't know.  She texted from the bus they put her on, then she said she wasn't even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going. Then all of a sudden her texts went dark.
"
Pete,"Whoa...
"
Firkle,"That's fucking creepy man.
"
Michael,"I just can't believe it. I can't believe parents would do that to their child.
"
Worker,"Alright now, you say that you witnessed your friend being abused by her parents.
"
Michael,"Yes. They called her an emo.
"
Worker,"What's wrong with that?
"
Michael,"Emos suck! Their vile, self-pitying, depressed assholes!
"
Worker,"So, why do you think they called her that?
"
Michael,"Because she's Goth, and some ignorant people don't know the difference!
"
Worker,"What is the difference?
"
Pete,"Oh my God! They're totally different!
"
Worker,"Okay, different how?
"
Pete,"They're achm, you know, one is good and an' emos are horrible!  You're, you know... They're posers!
"
Firkle,"Emos suck my Goth balls.
"
Michael,"Alright alright, think of it this way: a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up. But an emo thinks that deep down, they are totally fucked up.
"
Worker,"That's not much of a difference.
"
Pete,"That's a huge fucking difference!
"
Michael,"Okay okay, look, emos are more prone to suicide.
"
Pete,"This fuckin' bitch, man.
"
Michael,"But goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people commit suicide
"
Pete,"Goth's darkness is nihilistic whereas Emo's is cynical.
"
Michael,"Wait, I thought we were cynical. ...What what whatever, it doesn't matter.
"
Pete,"No, see, you're nihilistic.
"
Michael,"Oh yeah, you're right.
"
Henrietta,"Hel-lo?! Somebody let me out of here! You can't treat people like this!  This is fucking ridiculous! What's wrong with you?! I'm gonna go to the fucking cops when I get out of here! 
"
Pete,"What if she comes back, and she's all preppy and conformist?
"
Michael,"She's only been there two weeks. They can't have changed her that much. Can they have? 
"
Firkle,"Oh. My. God. 
"
Henrietta,"Hey guys. 
"
Pete,"What the hell have they done to you?
"
Henrietta,"What do you mean? They couldn't do anything. They can't fix me. They don't even understand me. 
"
Michael,"Oh my God it's worse than we thought! They made her emo!
"
Michael,"Has she said one word to either one of you guys?
"
Pete,"Nothing. It's like she's a totally different person. 
"
Michael,"She won't even look at us. All she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids. 
"
Emo Boy,"God, PE class is for such wannabe posers.
"
Emo Girl,"I'd rather kill myself than put on gym shorts.
"
Henrietta,"I wish there would just be an earthquake, so we could all die.
"
Pete,"Uugh, how could she hang out with them??
"
Michael,"There must something else going on here.
"
Henrietta,"Not now Mom! I'm suicidal!
"
Michael,"It's not your mom, it's me.
"
Henrietta,"Oh, hey. 
"
Michael,"What did they do you you? At that camp?
"
Henrietta,"What do you mean? Just the usual group therapy crap.
"
Michael,"Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that place turned you into an emo.
"
Henrietta,"That's ridiculous. I'm not anything. I don't fit in anywhere. I'm not emo, okay?
"
Michael,"Then why are you listening to Sunny Day Real Estate?  I was thinking, maybe they just made you confused at that place. Maybe they didn't know what they were doing. But then I started thinking, maybe that place... turned you emo on purpose. Like maybe they knew what they were doing.
"
Henrietta,"You should probably stop digging for answers.
"
Michael,"What?!
"
Henrietta,"There's no winning this for you.  Soon the entire world will be emo. It is our time.
"
Michael,"Nooo waaaaay.
"
Henrietta,"Nobody understands us. And they won't understand until it is faaar tooo late.
"
Michael,"Omigodnowaaaaaaaaay.
"
Henrietta,"Do not fight it, Michael. Is being emo really all that different from being goth?  Join us!
"
Michael,"No waaay!  No way no waaaaaay!
"
A ring tone,"Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and despair! Death and desp-
"
Pete,"Hello?
"
Michael,"It's worse thann we thought.
"
Pete,"What is? Everything? 
"
Michael,"No! I mean Henrietta. I confronted her and she was all like ""I am emo! And emos are going to rule the world"" and I was like ""No waaay!"" and she was like ""Yeah, soon it will be too late."" and I was all ""No waaay!""
"
Pete,"No way.
"
Michael,"Yeah, so listen: call up Firkle and meet me at Village Inn. I gotta run home, but I'll be there in ten minutes. 
"
Mom,"Michael! Michael! 
"
Michael,"Can't now, Mom! I've got an emergency!
"
Dad,"In the dining room Michael! Let's go!  Have a seat, son.  Your mom and I have decided you're going to go away for a little while.
"
Michael,"What??
"
Dad,"We've been put in touch with this camp for troubled kids like you and-
"
Michael,"What the hell are you talking about?!
"
Mom,"This place gonna fix you, make you normal child! 
"
Michael,"No! You've gotta listen to me! You don't know what you're doing!!  You fucking conformists!  They're evillll!
"
Pete,"I never thought it would end like this. I never thought that Goths would just be slowly replaced by Emos.
"
Firkle,"Pete... if they get me... if I get sent to that camp... and I come back Emo... kill me. Promise that you'll kill me.
"
Pete,"I promise.
"
Waitress,"Hey, you kids need to order somethin' or you need to go! 
"
Pete,"Not now, lady, we're really depressed.
"
Waitress,"So what else is new?
"
Pete,"This is different, okay?! Our two friends are being bodysnatched by Emos!  There's only one other group who understands Emos like we do. We're gonna have to team up with the Vampires.
"
Firkle,"Are you crazy?
"
Pete,"What choice do we have?!
"
Firkle,"The Vampires are our sworn enemy. We beat up their leader, and burned down their lair. Don't you remember?
"
Pete,"Yeah I remember. And it may be a suicide mission, but we have to walk right in the middle of the Vampires, and ask them for help.
"
Vampir,"Okay, let's all be seated please?  This is thee noon meeting of the Vamp kids? I am Mike, your lord and dark master, per se.
"
Vamps,"Hail Mike.
"
Mike,"Okay uhhh, our main order of business is of course the Halloween social. We're still looking for volunteers to make the- 
"
Mohawk Vamp,"It's the Goth kids! 
"
Pete,"Ugh. You spit on me, Larry.  Uhh, hey everybody, uuhm, I know we aren't on the greatest terms right now. We realize we called you all queermos, aaand we're sorry we burned down the Hot Topic at the mall.
"
Firkle,"Sorry.
"
Pete,"But uhhh we have a bigger problem here, and it's ALL of our problem.
"
Mike,"You've got a lot of nerve coming here!
"
Pete,"Now, shut up Mike. Listen, okay? There's a camp that kids like us are being sent to, a-and somehow this place is taking kids like us and... turning them Emo.  Yeah. You might not even be able to tell at first. It could have already happened. One of you might already be turned.
"
Black Vamp,"Okay hold up! Hold up! You mean that one of us might not really be a Vamp kid? 
"
Pete,"Uhhhhh, right.
"
Black Vamp,"Well whoever you is, you better get yo' ass ready to run, muthafucka, 'cause you're a damn traitor! And I bet you it's this little nigga right here!
"
Henrietta,"Are you guys getting into that Fall Out Boy concert?
"
Emo Girl,"I can't. I'm too depressed. I keep cutting myself.
"
Henrietta,"Yeah. I'm cutting myself to hurt this worthless body that I'm in. 
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Henrietta, I baked cookies for your new little Emo friends.
"
Henrietta,"Not now, Mom! Can't you see I'm hurting?!  I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment! Sorry I'm not the pretty cheerleader ya always wanted! 
"
Mr. Biggle,"Does she still seem better?
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Oh, much better! She didn't call me a bitch, and she actually apologized to me.
"
Mr. Biggle,"Well that's more like it.
"
Emo Boy 1,"You know what we should do? After us Emos take over the Earth? We should um, paint the White House black. And we should have Fall Out Boy at the Super Bowl. 
"
Emo Boy 2,"We're Emos.  When we rule the Earth we're not gonna have football.
"
Emo Boy 1,"Oh yeah. 
"
Mike,"And you say she just showed up like this?
"
Pete,"You know Henrietta; that thing in there is not Henrietta!
"
Cowlick Vamp,"That blonde Emo is Sarah Collins. She was a Vamp kid two weeks ago.
"
Black Vamp,"You want me to go in there and waste these mothafuckas?! I'll do it!
"
Pete,"We can't just go in there and kick their asses. We have to stop this thing at its source.
"
Mike,"Indeed. If there is some kind of black magic at work creating these monsters, then we will have to use our most powerful Vampiric abilities to stop it.
"
Cowlick Vamp,"Do you mean?
"
Mike,"Yes, my child of darkness. We must call upon the powers of the Vamp kids' most sacred entity, per se. Only he can help us in this darkest time. This calls... for a summoning.
"
Mike,"We call upon the creator of all that is dark! The godfather of Death and Despair! Edgar Allan Poe, your followers in darkness beg for your help!  We summon to the world of the living the great Edgar Allan Poe! Knower of all that is misery! Your children need special guidance! Per se.
"
Pete,"This, is your plan?! Try to summon Edgar Allan Poe back from the dead?!
"
Mike,"Edgar Allan Poe was the original Vamp kid.
"
Pete,"No, he was the original Goth, but he'd been dead for 150 years!
"
Black Vamp,"Ey, look man! All genres of Gothic subcultures are derivatives of Poe's work. Muthafucka!
"
Pete,"Look, we came to you for help, and all you've done since then is waste our time! 
"
Cowlick Vamp,"Holy shit look! 
"
Poe,"Where am I? What is this place?
"
Firkle,"It's him! It's Edgar Allan Poe.
"
Poe,"Why have the living summoned me from my rest? 
"
Pete,"Uhhhhh okayokay, listen: there's this camp for troubled kids, right? Only they aren't helping kids, they're, they're purposefully turning them into Emos.
"
Poe,"Emos? ...Ew-oh my God, Emos are such wannabe conformists.
"
Mike,"Yeah, oh yes!
"
Pete,"Right!
"
Poe,"Children of Darkness, I would help you, but I fear I cannot be seen with a bunch of douchey Vamp kids and their poser-ass plastic fangs.
"
Pete,"Thank you!
"
Mike,"Hey!
"
Pete,"I'm just saying it's nice to know that Edgar Allan Poe agrees wth us.
"
Poe,"Agrees with who? Is that red dye in your hair or did a blood demon take a shit on your head, poser?
"
Black Vamp,"Ah ah! He got you there, nigga!
"
Pete,"Okay, look, we're running out of time. You have to help us stop the Emos.
"
Poe,"Why should I? Just 'cause you summoned me doesn't mean you're the boss of me!
"
Pete,"Uh, yeah, it kind of does.
"
Poe,"Oh okay, Mom. Let's go fight the Emos, Mom.
"
Michael,"What? Where are you tay- No! NO!!  What the hell?? ...Oh my God.  Get me out of here! Let me go!
"
Gardener,"Shhhhh.  It's best you don't upset them. 
"
Michael,"What the hell are you doing to people?!
"
Gardener,"Not me. I just work for them. They're not evil, you know? They're just misunderstood. All I do is help the Emos get into their human hosts. They promised me when they take over Earth I can have a cabin on the lake, and all the steak I can eat.
"
Michael,"Wait a minute. Emos are plants? 
"
Gardener,"Shhh, shhh, it's okay. Not just any plants. They're very unique. Very special. Nobody undertands them. Emoclarus americanus. Wonderful species. Except for their tendencies of self-mutilation and the need for other species to acknowledge their pain.
"
Michael,"Oh, it all makes sense now! 
"
Gardener,"Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry, Emo King.  Oh no, I wasn't talking to him. I mean, I was, but- Y-yes! Yes, I understand.  Right away.
"
Michael,"No.  What are you doing?! I don't wanna be emo!
"
Gardener,"You just don't understand. You'll understand them soon.
"
Michael,"What the...? 
"
Gardener,"It's quicker if you don't fight it.
"
Michael,"No, NOOOOOOOOO! 
"
Pete,"Alright, listen up. Once we find our friend, we've gotta torch the place and get out.
"
Firkle,"Dude, Edgar, can you not smoke in the car?
"
Poe,"You can't tell me what to do! Who elected you the mayor of me?!
"
Pete,"Cut it out, Edgar! It's annoying everybody!
"
Poe,"God, you guys are so lame!  And if you want my help, you'd better all stop calling me Edgar.
"
Black Vamp,"Well that's your name, isn't it?
"
Poe,"That's the name my stupid parents gave me! I like to be called by my Goth name: NightPain
"
"Black Vamp, Mike, and Pete","Oh God...
"
Poe,"What? You guys are posers!
"
Black Vamp,"Ey, just so you all know, if one of you ain't who you say they is, and we get inside that base and you reveal you're actually one of them Emo muthafuckas in disguise, I WILL go crazy on yo' ass!
"
Poe,"If one of us is a traitor, it's probably your wannabe vampire leader.
"
Mike,"Oh, fuck off, NightPain.
"
Poe,"Make me, poser.
"
Pete,"Michael?! You here?
"
Mike,"I feel like we're being watched. 
"
Pete,"Dude! Michael, are you okay?
"
Michael,"Kick it over! Stop the plant!  Oh! Oh, thank God you're here. Emos are plants and they're invading human bodies.
"
Pete,"Alright, we're gonna get you out of here, and then we're gonna burn this whole place down. 
"
Firkle,"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that's not the plan.
"
Gardener,"You did very good. The emo plants are very pleased with your dedication.
"
Michael,"Firkle! All this time I thought you were Goth! How long have you been Emo? 
"
Firkle,"Don't you see we can't stop them? We might as well join' em. 
"
Gardener,"Yes Emo King, right away.  The Emo King wants us to proceed at once. 
"
Pete,"Ugh! Let us go, you ultimate conformists!
"
Gardener,"Don't fight it. It's quicker that way. 
"
Mike,"Oh God! I'm starting to feel Emo.
"
Pete,"Wait a minute. Where the hell is Edgar Allan Poe?
"
Mike,"He said he was over this, and was gonna hang out at the Village Inn.
"
Pete,"What?!
"
Waitress,"Hey, are you gonna order any food, or are you just gonna sit there and drink coffee all day?
"
Poe,"Leave me alone! I just want coffeh.
"
Waitress,"Little prick.
"
Poe,"Bitch.
"
Pete,"Poe? Edgar Allan Poe, where are you?  What the hell are you doing?! Yo're supposed to be helping us!
"
Poe,"I can't right now. I'm dealing with a lot and I just have a lot of anxiety.
"
Pete,"Look, we  summoned you to help us save the world!
"
Poe,"What's the point? Save some people so some other people can be lame? And then those lame-os can be lamer to some other posers?
"
Pete,"God, he is such a downer! 
"
Gardener,"Just let the spores inside you. Stop fighting it.
"
Mike,"Wait. Look!
"
Poe,"Okay, I'm here, posers.
"
Pete,"NightPain! Destroy the plant leader! The leader over there! 
"
Poe,"What do you want me to do?
"
"Mike, Michael, and Pete","Shoot it!
"
Poe,"Really? Shoot a plant?
"
Michael,"Shoot it! 
"
Poe,"Wait a minute. What is this?  This says it was bought at Lowe's Home and Garden for $29.95. 
"
Gardener,"Lowe's Home and Garden?
"
Pete,"Hey, these are just plants.
"
Gardener,"No they, they talk to me.
"
Poe,"No, they're just, like, ficus plants and vibrating pots.
"
Gardener,"But-
"
Voice,"Looks like it's over, Harold Flannagan. So we have just one question for you: are you scared?!
"
Flannagan,"What do you mean?
"
Voice,"ARE YOU SCARED?!
"
Flannagan,"YES!!! 
"
Voice,"That's good! 'Cause you're on... ""Yes, I Was Scared!"" 
"
Pete,"What?? 
"
Host,"Look! Look at the camera right there
"
Flannagan,"Oh my God, are you serious? 
"
Host,"Your wife Sarah put you up to this.
"
Sarah,"Haha I got you! 
"
Firkle,"This is a prank?
"
Black Vamp,"Oh man that's good! They got us good!
"
Firkle,"I turned traitor for no good reason?
"
Pete,"Did you know about this?
"
Michael,"I have no idea what's going on.
"
Host,"Howard, did you suspect at all that a gardener job at a camp for troubled teens was a setup?
"
Flannagan,"No, they really had me convinced!
"
Host,"And you didn't suspect anything when we had plants tell you to turn Goths and Vamp kids into Emos when really they're exactly the same thing?
"
Flannagan,"I guess I should have figured it out. I'm an idiot. 
"
Host,"Tune in again next week, when we make a woman from Milwaukee think she's working at a haunted abortion clinic.
"
Henrietta,"So, my friends. Have you made the transformation?
"
Pete,"Uhhhh, Henrietta, we have some bad news. The plants you think took over your body and made you emo? They're just plants.  From Lowe's Home and Garden.
"
Michael,"It was all a prank by some douchey network reality show.
"
Henrietta,"Nnnnoooo, there's an organic spore in my head that made me switch cliques so easily.
"
Michael,"No, you just kind of did it on your own.
"
Henrietta,"Oh my Gawd.  This is so... em-barrassing.
"
Pete,"Ahh, hang on. What I meant to say was  we just infiltrated the Emo lair and... we torched the plant leader.
"
Henrietta,"Oh.  Oh!  Ihihit's meee-e! I'm, I'm I'm me again!  Oh my God I'm... all better. Thanks you guys.
"
Mrs. Biggle,"Henrietta, I have dinner ready.
"
Henrietta,"Shut up, Mom! Leave me alone, you conformist bag of demon jizz!
"
Mrs. Biggle,"...Fatty. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future.  M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink.  Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal.  M'kay...  You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school.  Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on ""school clinic"" Mkay, see nurse. M'kay. Respiration problems.  Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay.  It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board.  Mesage... board.  Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance,  here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski.  Okay, little Ike says ""My brother is a homo"" Ike made a little drawing of his brother too.  Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice.  It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there.
"
Cartman,"That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
"
Butters,"Heheh, yeah. 
"
Kyle,"Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
"
Sheila,"Oh, Kyle, your little brother is, getting older. He's not a baby anymore.
"
Kyle,"I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
"
Sheila,"It's natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don't you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. 
"
Kyle,"Hey Ike, how's it going?
"
Ike,"Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm on my computer! 
"
Kyle,"I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
"
Ike,"Do I look like I wanna do fuckin' fingerpaints?!  Look at the fuckin' zits on my face!
"
Kyle,"Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
"
Ike,"Then stop harassing me, bro! You don't know what it's like to be a baby goin' through puberty! I don't know whether to watch Yo Gabba Gabba or go out and tame some strange!
"
Kyle,"Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
"
Ike,"Dancy Dance is my favorite.
"
Kyle,"It always has been. See? This is nice. 
"
Ike,"Who would you rather fuck?  Foofa or Toodee?
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Ike,"I wanna fuck Foofa.  I wouldn't wanna fuck Toodee. She's a dike. You can tell. But Foofa, man.  I bet she's got some sweet strange.  I don't even know what the fuck Muno is.
"
Kyle,"Ike, is that chewing tobacco?
"
Ike,"What?! You gonna fuckin' narc and tell Mom?!
"
Kyle,"No, I just don't think it's healthy.
"
Ike,"That's 'cause you don't understand shit!  I knew this was a bad idea!  I'm gonna watch Yo Gabba Gabba in my roomsy!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Come in, m'kay.
"
Kyle,"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh-kay, have you set up a counseling appointment on IntelliLink?
"
Kyle,"No.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Ookay, that's fine, that's fine. We can use IntelliLink to see what's available. Let's see, counseling request. Students. Make appointment.  Okay, ah whoops. Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment.  Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?
"
Kyle,"It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?
"
Kyle,"Right now.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?
"
Kyle,"I don't know.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Alright, I can do a lookup for the name. Uh go back. Main menu.  Oh... Damnit. Okay now, back.  Set- no, set appointment. Okay, speakers off.  Okay, uh... Okay, what is your smart name, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, let's see, lights.  Mood.  Start counseling timer.  Okay there we go. Okay, we got it.  Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?
"
Kyle,"He's just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I'm stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, he just seems so young.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don't you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M'kay?  You know, this is the first time I've been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing.
"
Minister,"Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you've probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard.  Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you're a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you're a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange.
"
Ike,"This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!
"
Kyle,"Let's just give it a chance, Ike.
"
Minister,"Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You're saying things like ""hey boddy"" and ""hey guy"" because now that you're older you're discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call ""guy"" is quickly becoming your friend.  But now let's discuss how a man and a woman make love.  First, a man and a woman fall in love. Then the man farts on the woman's strange,  filling the woman's strange with air so that the woman can queef on the man's face.  And, a baby is born.  The entire process can take up to six months a-  It's what? ... That's not how a baby is born? ... What's semen? ... Well then, why did my wife queef on my face? ... She said it was to- ...  Well then why would sh-?! ... I'm gonna get to the bottom of this! 
"
Minister,"Make me look like an idiot, will you?!
"
Minister,"Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that's how babies are born!
"
Wife,"I was being sarcastic.
"
Minister,"Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that's how it's done!
"
Wife,"I was angry because you never listen to me. Because I wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go.
"
Minister,"Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!
"
Minister,"Totally embarrassing and degrading! She queefed right in my face!
"
Therapist,"Well, maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home.
"
Kyle,"What the fuck is going on?!
"
Ike,"You're fucking stupid, Kyle! 
"
Kyle,"I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
"
Stan,"He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
"
Kyle,"He doesn't even let me near him!
"
Cartman,"That sucks, dude.
"
Kyle,"What??
"
Cartman,"I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
"
Kyle,"Oh, thanks! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, can he just go talk to the principal?
"
Mr. Mackey,"No, this is gonna work! I called IntelliLink and they said they were sending over an engineer. 
"
Cody,"Is this Classroom 7?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Yes!
"
Cody,"My name's Cody. I'm your smartnician. You're havin' some intelliproblems with your astutelinks?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?
"
Cody,"Uh huh, well here's the problem: your amsrtnames aren't intelligrated. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh I see.
"
Cody,"If you wanna have those intelligrated with EasyLink, you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?
"
Cody,"Let my call my supervisor on the intelliphone. 
"
Kyle,"Hey Ike.
"
Ike,"Get out of my room, Kyle! I'm playing trucks!
"
Kyle,"Ike, I'm sorry, but I couldn't get us out of school Friday. I can't take you to Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
"
Ike,"You promised!
"
Kyle,"I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
"
Ike,"Well what am I supposed to do?! See it myself?! I'm a little baby! Who's gonna hold my fuckin' hand?! You don't give a shit about how I feel!
"
Kyle,"Ike, I do! I just-
"
Ike,"You just love pushing me around! Is that what you wanna do, Kyle?! Kick the baby?! Well alrighty bro! Come on, Kyle! Kick the baby!  Come on bro! Kick the fuckin' baby! Let's see you try it, wuss!
"
Plex,"Hey Muno, what should we do now?
"
Muno,"Let's play Cool Cool Trick.
"
Plex,"Aaaall right! Who out in the audience has a cool cool trick to show us?  What's your name, little boy?
"
Ryan,"My name is Ryan!
"
Plex,"And what is your cool cool trick, Ryan?
"
Ryan,"My cool cool trick is that I can jump in the air.  Let's see you... jump in the air! 
"
Plex,"And what's your name, little boy?
"
Ike,"Ike Broflovski.
"
Plex,"Do you have a cool trick?
"
Ike,"Yeah, for my cool cool trick I'm gonna tame Foofa's strange.
"
Plex,"Tame mo what?
"
Ike,"I can tame Foofa's strange, bro.
"
Plex,"Uhhh, alright. Let's see our friend Ike tame Foofa's strange! 
"
Kyle,"Ike no! Stop!
"
Plex,"Oh, I see. You're actually-  Wait! Oh my God, what are you doing?! No no no!  What are you doing to Foofa?! No!
"
Plex,"Now you listen here, little boy! It is never okay to take off your clothes and grind on another person!
"
Toodee,"No, that's wrong!
"
Plex,"Don't do it.
"
Brobee,"Uh uh.
"
Kyle,"We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
"
Muno,"A little young for that, isn't he?
"
Kyle,"That's what I thought.
"
Ike,"This is stupid, bro.  Foofa shouldn't be limiting herself to little kids. She's fuckin' fine, dude. 
"
Plex,"What you did was very traumatic for Foofa. Isn't that right, Foofa?  Foofa?
"
Foofa,"He's right, Plex. We're getting older. I don't wanna do the little kid thing the rest of my life.
"
Brobee,"Foofa, what are you talking about?
"
Foofa,"It's time for us to start playing to older people. Maybe we need to be edgier. Have a little sex appeal.
"
Toodee,"Foofa, no!
"
Foofa,"I'm an artist. And if all I ever do is play to kids, then I'll be a joke.  I have to move on. 
"
Plex,"Oh God. What has this little boy done??
"
Minister,"I try not to think about it, Rick. I try to just forget aboot it and then move on, but I can't. I mean... she queefed right in my face!
"
Rick,"Have you and your wife seen a therapist together?
"
Minister,"Yes, we went but... I just can't erase the memory of my helpless face being queefed on like that. Who's to say she won't do it again?
"
Rick,"Don't you think this has something to do with your new job?
"
Minister,"What do you mean?
"
Rick,"There's more to this, Terry. A lady never queefs in her lord's face without some major cause. You started as the Canadian Minister of Health and three months later your wife queefed in your face. There's a connection.
"
Terry,"I took the job to try and make Canada's health care system better. What could that have to do with my wife?
"
Rick,"Terry, I'm your friend. And I'm not just your friend, I'm also your boddy
"
Terry,"Thanks, guy.
"
Rick,"And I'm telling you there's more to this than you think!  And if you want to save your marriage, and your face, you need to figure it out quick.
"
Principal Victoria,"Mr. Mackey, so far the school has spent  $22,000 on the IntelliLink system, and so far it's been an unmitigated disaster.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.
"
Mr. Adler,"They can't sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off!
"
Mr. Mackey,"I know that IntelliLink has had some... hiccups... uhkay. But I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the IntelliLink system and make sure it runs smoothly. I want you all to meet Pat Conners. 
"
Pat,"Hello everyone.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Don't ""Hello"" us, Pat! This system that you're responsible for now isn't working out! So  what the hell are you gonna do about it?!
"
Pat,"Oh. Well, I'm just sort of getting acclimated to the situation and I-
"
Mr. Mackey,"Getting acclimated?!  Do you know how much money we wated on that thing?! How about you take some damned responsibility! Get the hell out of here, Pat! You're fired! Get out!  Well. How the hell are we gonna clean up Pat's mess? I guess, I dunno, I guess we got no choice, m'kay. We're just gonna need to the upgrade to the IntelliLink Gold Package. 
"
Principal Victoria,"Oh noo!
"
Mr. Mackey,"No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.
"
Coach,"Mr. Mackey, let's be clear. IntelliLink was your idea. You should admit it was a bad one and stop being so defensive.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an ""accident"" while you were ""drinking"" on a ""hike,"" ""N'kay!""
"
Miles,"Hey now listen here-!
"
Mr. Mackey,"No! Now you listen to me!  IntelliLink is a great idea, and we just need the Goddamned Gold Package! We are doublin' down!
"
Anchor,"You are watching E! Entertainment News. God knows why.  She's all grown up and she wants you to know it. From kids show star to sex symbol, Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa is ready to rock!  She's been seen out partying, photographed smoking pot, and now, Foofa has announced a raunchy performance on the MTV Video Music Awards. Foofa's new manager claims the MTV performance will be one for the record books.
"
Ike,"Foofa's got that nice shaved strange that you just wanna get in and tame the second you see it.
"
Anchor,"The video awards are at 8 pm tomorrow.
"
Foofa,"Oh this is so exciting!
"
Ike,"Told you it'd go over well.
"
Kyle,"Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
"
Ike,"Shut up, Kyle! Just ignore my little brother.
"
Kyle,"I'm your big brother, Ike! 
"
Ike,"Answer the door, twerp! 
"
Plex,"Can I talk to you?
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry, but right now I'm feeling-
"
Plex,"Foofa! 
"
Brobee,"Thank you, dude.
"
Muno,"Oh thank God.
"
Toodee,"Heey.
"
Kyle,"Hey!
"
Plex,"Foofa, what is this about you going on the MTV Video Awards?
"
Foofa,"I'm done being a kiddie star!
"
Plex,"Foofa, you don't have to show your strange to get attention.
"
Ike,"You just don't get it 'cause you're a robot, Plex.
"
Plex,"Alright, you won't listen to us, but maybe you'll listen to our special guest, Sinéad O'Connor! 
"
Sinéad,"Don't do it, Foofa, Don't sell out your strange to those corporate bastards.
"
Ike,"Awww, screw off, Sinéad O'Connor. No one gives a crap about you.
"
Plex,"Don't show your strange on TV.
"
Troupe,"Don't show your strange.
"
Plex,"Your strange is for your husband, not for all the world to see.
"
Troupe,"Don't show your strange on TV
"
Sinéad,"I'm looking for a boyfriend. Looking for a boyfriend.
"
Kyle,"Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
"
Terry,"...Have you ever had someone you love queef in your face? 
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Terry,"I'm sorry, I'm calling everyone in the Canadian health care system to find out if they're pleased with their health care. Is this  Ike Broflovski?
"
Kyle,"No, this is his brother.
"
Terry,"Your brother receives his medication from us, so we just wanna be sure he's satisfied with the service.
"
Kyle,"Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!
"
Terry,"Before this meeting continues, I should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores.
"
Kyle,"Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
"
Terry,"People all over the world get their medication from Canada.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
"
Terry,"That's impossible! The Canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with IntelliLink. 
"
Kyle,"You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
"
Terry,"Sure, no problem.  Now, what is your brother's Canadian Medicare's smartname?
"
Kyle,"I dunno!  Try ""strangetamer.""
"
Terry,"""strangetamer""  Uh, yeP, there it is.  Ahh yes, here we go. I see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last May.  Ah, yes, I'm afraid IntelliLink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast.
"
Kyle,"Are you saying that Ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an IntelliLink screwup?!
"
Terry,"Yes, that's right.
"
Kyle,"That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
"
Terry,"It's fine!  It works fine! Just give it some time!  God, you sound like my wife!  My... my wife.
"
Rick,"That must be it. Don't you see, Terry? That health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile, and your wife's been puttin' up with it.
"
Terry,"And... that's why she queefed in my face.
"
Kyle,"Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
"
Announcer,"Tom Brady looking sluggish again today. Not sure what his problem has been lately.
"
Tom Brady,"Blue 28! ... Blue 28!
"
Commentator,"Yeah, definitely not looking as strong and virile as he has in the past, Tom.
"
Tom Brady,"Huthuuuut  Hike!
"
Announcer,"Brady steps back to pass.  He's got an open man at the 40 yard line! 
"
Commentator,"And whatever is wrong with Tom Brady just seems to be getting worse.  Go Broncos.
"
Cody,"Okay, there we go.  Your students can buy school lunches now, but they won't be able to get grades.
"
Mr. Mackey,"No, they have to be able to get grades!
"
Cody,"Well, what you prbably wanna do is upgrade to IntelliLink Platinum.
"
Mr. Mackey,"No! There's no more upgrades, m;kay?! I just want this  to work!
"
Cody,"...What exactly do you mean by ""work""?
"
Mr. Mackey,"I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!
"
Cody,"Oh, you want the Centurion package. That's where we take all the IntelliLink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them. Then we wipe all the computers of IntelliLink software and you never deal with us again.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Alright, upgrade me to the Centurion package.
"
Cody,"Right away.  Well alright sir, here's a clipboard you can use for students to sign up for counseling,  and I wanna thank you for choosing IntelliLink. 
"
Announcer,"The MTV Video Music Awards will be back with a performance from Yo Gabba Gabba's Foofa singing, ""Pound My Sweet Strange.""
"
Stage hand,"Two minutes, Foofa.
"
Foofa,"Thanks. Oh my, here we go! 
"
Kyle,"Ike!  Wait! '
"
Ike,"Get out of here, dude!
"
Kyle,"Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
"
Ike,"No, you don't understand, wuss! Why can't you just let me grow up?! Why do you keep harassing me?!
"
Kyle,"Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
"
Host,"All right, y'all, here comes our next big act!
"
Kyle,"Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
"
Host,"Give it up for the sexiest bitch on earth, it's Foofa!
"
Foofa,"Come on, Ike. Ike?
"
Ike,"He's right, Foofa. Part of growing up is rebelling, but I'm gonna get older whether I like it or not. So why push it? I think I'm just gonna let it happen naturally. 
"
Yo Gabba Gabba,"Yaaaaay.
"
Brobee,"Foofa? 
"
Foofa,"Come on, come on, and pound my strange. Pound it like this,  pound it like that.
"
Terry,"It was a mistake.
"
Wife,"What?
"
Terry,"Trying to reform Canada's health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasn't working. And even when my wife said the system was too complicated, I wouldn't listen.
"
Wife,"Oh Terry, I was just trying to get your attention. I'm sorry I queefed in your face.
"
Terry,"I deserved it. Anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face. Thank you, my lady.
"
Wife,"So IntelliLink is gone, my lord?
"
Terry,"Yes, I've upgraded to the Gold package. Within no time, Canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications, and going back to normal.
"
Kyle,"Ike?
"
Ike,"Kyle! It's Dora the Explorer!
"
Dora,"Come on, let's climb the mountain.
"
Kyle,"It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
"
Ike,"Yaaay! 
"
Dora,"We made it all the way to the top.
"
Ike,"Oh man, I wouldn't mind hittin' that. I bet she's got that hot Puerto Rican strange. 
"
Kyle,"Yeah, I bet she does.
"
Ike,"Yaaaay!
"
Cartman,"Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"About what?!
"
Cartman,"I'm afraid that... Kyle and I got into a little disagreement yesterday. Yeah, yeah it's... pretty nasty. And um, I was totally wrong and you were right, Kyle. I thought only humans could be gingers. Is Davin here? Davin Miller?  Oh yeah, there you are. I own an apology to you too, Davin. When Kyle said that humans weren't the only species that can have light skin and freckles I totally laughed in his face. But it turns out Kyle was right: there are other animals that can be ginger as well I didn't believe it. I guess I didn't want to believe it, but this morning I saw a red-haired light-skinned cow and I owe you, Kyle, and you, Davin, my sincerest apology.
"
Craig,"Where did you find a red-haired cow?
"
Cartman,"Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
"
Cartman,"There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. 
"
Butters,"Whoa, look at it!
"
Cartman,"You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
"
Craig,"Wow, that's pretty trippy.
"
Cartman,"Yes! Yeah, be sure to get some pictures of it!  I'm pretty sure this occurs only rarely in nature! 
"
Kyle,"Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 
"
Cartman,"What? What joke? This is real!
"
Kyle,"Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
"
Cartman,"No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
"
Butters,"Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
"
Cartman,"Thank you, Butters! 
"
Craig,"I gotta show this to my mom! 
"
Butters,"Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
"
Cartman,"Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
"
Kyle,"Even the dumbest lie can have big consequences.
"
Cartman,"Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?
"
Kyle,"Huh?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
"
Butters,"Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Nothing. 
"
Butters,"Busted!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Wuwhat's going on?
"
Principal Victoria,"Kyle, these men have apparently come all the way from Israel to speak with me, but... we need a translator.
"
Kyle,"I don't speak Hebrew.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important.  This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.
"
Rabbi 1,"We're just trying to tell them that we come on very urgent business. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Anything?
"
Kyle,"He said they come on urgent business.
"
Principal Victoria,"Ohh, what does he need?
"
Rabbi 2,"Look, we believe that this school has something which is of the utmost importance to our people! We wish to see the red cow!
"
Kyle,"The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
"
Principal Victoria,"For what? What did he say, Kyle?
"
Rabbi 1,"Please, you must understand! The fate of the world is at stake!  The coming of a red heifer is the nost holy sign in all of Judaism. It signals the beginning of the End. It is not just our religion, but Islam and Christianity as well. They all agree on one thing.  That the red heifer means the End of Times.
"
Mr. Mackey,"You catch any of that, Kyle? 
"
Kyle,"It's right over here by uh-
"
Rabbi 2,"Oh my holy shmear! 
"
Rabbi 2,"The Muslims! They beat us here! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"What's goin' on, Kyle??
"
Kyle,"He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
"
Rabbi 2,"Step away! You all know what this means!
"
Cleric 1,"Yes! And you know you are about to die!
"
Kyle,"Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
"
Rabbi 1,"Don't touch it! 
"
Cartman,"Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it.""
"
Kyle,"Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
"
Cartman,"I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 
"
Kyle,"NOOOO!
"
Rabbi 4,"The Muslims and the Christians are calling for a meeting to discuss the terms of war.
"
Rabbi 2,"Very well, let us meet to discuss how the world as we know it ends.
"
Rabbi 1,"Alright, so far we agree there'll be no automatic rifles, no shanks, and no chemical weapons.
"
Cleric 2,"If there can be no chemical weapons, then the Christians can use no nuclear weapons. 
"
Bishop,"Come on, without nuclear weapons, what kind of final Armageddon is this gonna be?! 
"
Rabbi 3,"But couldn't we agree on non-ballistic nuclear weapons only?
"
Bishop,"Yeah, I suppose that's fine.
"
Cleric 2,"That makes sense.
"
Rabbi 1,"Non-ballistic nuclear only. Alright. Now on to prisoners. Are we all agreeing to decapitations?
"
Israeli,"Of course we are! What do you think this is?!
"
Others,"Yeah, come on! Just get to it!
"
Cleric 3,"Wait a minute, wait a minute! Has anyone noticed something? We are all in a room together. Talking.  Has it occurred to anyone else that this prophecy, which amazingly is in all three religions, could actually be meant to bring us together?
"
Bishop,"The prophecy says the red heifer signals the End.  Could it mean the end of... war?
"
Rabbi 1,"If the cow is sacrificed in Israel according to the prophecy, then perhaps it could bring about peace.
"
Anderson Cooper,"After all the years of holy wars and hatred, a possibility for peace... in the Middle East. In the past 48 hours, Jews, Muslims, and Christians have met in Israel to sort out their differences. It may be a rocky road, but many say the chance for peace is real. And all because of a red cow, discovered by a young boy here in the U.S. We'll be back with more on these amazing developments after this. 
"
Cartman,"Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
"
Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
Cartman,"I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
"
Kyle,"No shit!
"
Cartman,"I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
"
Kyle,"Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
"
Cartman,"No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
"
Cartman,"But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
"
Kyle,"Dude, go to Hell!
"
Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
"
Kyle,"Wwwait. 
"
Kyle,"Mom?
"
Sheila,"Hi bubbe.
"
Kyle,"Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
"
Sheila,"What is it, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"You're a fat skank, Mom. 
"
Cartman,"Kyle! Oh my gosh, what did you just say??
"
Kyle,"You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
"
Cartman,"Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 
"
Stan,"How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
"
Kyle,"I just... thought it'd be nice.
"
Cartman,"Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
"
Kyle,"Yes sir.
"
Cartman,"Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
"
Kyle,"Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.
"
Cartman,"You what??
"
Kyle,"Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
"
Craig,"Dude, what the hell are you talking about?
"
Kyle,"Yummy yummy yummy can I please Cartman's farts in my tummy?
"
Cartman,"Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.
"
Kyle,"Yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy.
"
Cartman,"Let's see. Oh! Oh! 
"
Kyle,"Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. 
"
Stan,"What the fuck?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Come on in.
"
Kyle,"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Wuh sure, Kyle. What's the matter?
"
Kyle,"If you knew something, but, you couldn't tell anyone, what... what would you do?
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
"
Kyle,"Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
"
Kyle,"Because they taste so yummy. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that.
"
Cartman,"Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
"
Kyle,"Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, are you sure?
"
Kyle,"Please...
"
Cartman,"Well alright. 
"
Kyle,"Yummy yummy.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
"
Bishop,"Today... begins the new Israel.  Today, we are all united as one.  Chakam balada.
"
Crowd,"Chakam balada! Chakam balada! 
"
Rabbi 3,"Now, let us celebrate under one symbol! 
"
Rabbi,"No way no waaay!
"
Muslim,"Epiiic!
"
David Lee Roth,"Hello Israel! 
"
CNN Reporter,"The party is officially underway. Jews, Christians and Muslims have united, ushering ten years of Van Halen.  Out in the crowd, people are celebrating like never before.  No doubt Israel is the happiest, rockingest place to be.
"
Stan,"Hey Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Hey
"
Stan,"Kyle, there's peace in the Middle East. They're saying maybe it's gonna lead to peace all over the world. Everyone's really happy. You should be too.
"
Kyle,"I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
"
Stan,"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
"
Kyle,"I just do, Stan.
"
Stan,"You like... how they smell? How they taste?
"
Kyle,"Yes.
"
Stan,"They're really that good?
"
Kyle,"Yes.
"
Stan,"Should I try them?
"
Kyle,"NO.
"
Ringtone,"Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy. Yummy yummy.
"
Kyle,"This is Cartman. I have to take it.  Hello?
"
Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
"
Kyle,"I don't care.
"
Cartman,"I care, Kyle. You should have a say in this; they're your yummy farts. Should we go with Thai?
"
Kyle,"That's fine. 
"
Stan,"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
"
Kyle,"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
"
Stan,"I don't get it, Kenny.
"
Kenny,"(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
"
Stan,"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
"
Kyle,"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
"
Spirit,"Kyle Broflovski.
"
Kyle,"Huh? Who...? Who is that?
"
Spirit,"Why do you endure all the farts, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
"
Spirit,"What you are doing... is the most awesome thing ever.
"
Kyle,"I... I know.
"
Spirit,"Who else would take such torment?
"
Kyle,"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
"
Spirit,"You should like, shave your head and get all peaceful about it. Your sacrifice saves the world.
"
Kyle,"Yes.
"
Kyle,"I endure what I must for the sake of all humanity.
"
CNN Reporter,"What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks! Things just keep getting better here, Tom. And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow, here on stage, and things are gonna go off!
"
Cartman,"You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 
"
Kyle,"Yes! Yes I will!
"
Cartman,"Huh? You comin'? 
"
Kyle,"Yes, whatever you want. 
"
Cartman,"Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 
"
Stan,"Kyle, don't do this. Don't eat Cartman's farts in front of the whole world.
"
Butters,"Just stop, please.
"
Kyle,"It's okay. Everyone, it's okay. Perhaps one day, you will all understand. What I do, I do because I care about each and every one of you. 
"
Craig,"Well now he just sounds like a self-righteous asshole.
"
Stan,"Hey Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Hello, Stan.
"
Stan,"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
"
Kyle,"There are greater things at work than what you understand.
"
Stan,"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
"
Kyle,"I'm actually the complete opposite.
"
Stan,"All of a sudden you seem to think you're above everyone else!
"
Kyle,"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
"
Stan,"See? You sound like a dick.
"
Kyle,"I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
"
Stan,"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
"
Kyle,"All you need to know is I'm way awesomer than you think, okay?!
"
Stan,"I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
"
Kenny,"(Huh? Like what?)
"
Stan,"This all started with the stupid peace in the Middle East, Kenny. For some reason it's making Kyle crazy. We've gotta get to the bottom of this!
"
Rabbi 1,"And now, let us honor the little boy who helped make all this happen, Eric Cartman, and his best friend, Fartboy. 
"
Cartman,"Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
"
Kyle,"Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
"
Cartman,"Are you sure, Fartboy? I've had a lot of strange food on this trip.
"
Kyle,"Yummy yummy I want your farts in my tummy.
"
Rabbi 1,"Uh excuse me, I'm sorry everyone, but apparently there's some breaking news in the United States.
"
Reporter,"We are in Colorado where the red cow was discovered, and apparently, two boys have shocking news that might change everything.
"
Stan,"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
"
Kyle,"Dude! Do not do this!
"
Stan,"No, dude, you don't understand. Cartman hasn't been telling the truth!
"
Kyle,"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
"
Stan,"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
"
Muslim 2,"""Oh"" what? 
"
Kyle,"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
"
Stan,"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
"
Stan,"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!""
"
Kyle,"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
"
Stan,"You should apologize to Kenny too.
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry, Kenny!
"
Kenny,"(That's okay, Kyle.)
"
Rabbi 1,"No, what is the new information?!
"
Stan,"The red cow... I saw it too. Ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light. It was a miracle.
"
Kyle,"Hurray!
"
Rabbi 1,"Oh no, it was a miracle?
"
Israeli 2,"Then, it's not true. The prophecy is not true! 
"
David Lee Roth,"Wait, I thought we were all here because of the prophecy of a miraculous red cow!
"
Rabbi 5,"No, the prophecy is that one day, a fat child with a small penis would decorate a cow to look ginger, not that one would miraculously just fall from the sky. 
"
Muslim 2,"I knew this was all too good to be true!
"
Bishop,"We are associating with these heathens for no reason!
"
Cartman,"Small penis?!
"
Anchor,"The party's over. Muslims, Jews, and Christians are back at each other's throats, and Israel is once again a place of conflict, and turmoil
"
Kyle,"Please, you have to listen to me! The prophecy actually did come true!
"
Rabbi 3,"No it di'n't.
"
Kyle,"Yes! It did!
"
Rabbi 1,"The prophecy was that a fat boy with a small penis would one day decorate a cow to look ginger. We should have known a prophecy like this... was too impossible to ever come to be.
"
Kyle,"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
"
Cartman,"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
"
Kyle,"But it's the truth!
"
Cartman,"No, it's not, Kyle. I have a huge dick.
"
Rabbi 1,"Sorry boys, but we've gotta get to our fight. There's a rumble at the Wailing Wall. . They leave, and Kyle turns around
"
Kyle,"Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
"
Cartman,"Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 
"
Guard 1,"The holiday season... is here, and Black Friday... is upon us. As you know, black Friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals. Last year, 26 people died, and 461 were seriously injured.  This winter the mall is offering 80% off to the first twenty people in the store.  For you new recruits, perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was like.  Or perhaps you thought workin' Black Friday wouldn't be a big deal. 
"
Randy,"I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
"
Guard 1,"Or maybe you're just too stupid to realize what you've gotten yourselves into.
"
Chief of Security,"That's enough!  Our only chance of surviving this year's sale is by sticking together! Those of you who signed up are to be... commended.  But I warn you: do not underestimate the battle that's about to take place outside those doors!  Winter is coming.
"
Cartman,"Good evening, sir. I'm calling together all the fighters of Zauron. I need to speak with Lady McCormick.
"
Kenny,"(She's not here right now.)
"
Cartman,"Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
"
Cartman,"Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
"
Clyde,"Which nobody can afford.
"
Cartman,"What if I were to tell you that if we all worked together there's a way we can get the new gaming system.
"
Token,"If you know of a way, wizard, then speak.
"
Cartman,"I have learned of a dark magic at work. The day after Thanksgiving, the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want. They are calling it... Black Friday.
"
Butters,"Woo, spooky.
"
Craig,"Black Friday? Come on, that can't be real.
"
Cartman,"It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
"
Stan,"It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
"
Cartman,"On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
"
Male Anchor,"Well it's almost Thanksgiving, and we all know what that means.
"
Female Anchor,"That's right. Black Friday is right around the corner.
"
Male Anchor,"Ouch.
"
Female Anchor,"And people are already gearing up. 
"
Shopper 1,"We usually start linin' up around 3 am. We uh douse ourselves in pig blood, because it does help us slip through the crowd when the doors open.
"
Shopper 2,"We do it every year, part of the family tradition. Last year we lost our youngest daughter. He head was stepped on and crushed, but, in her memory, we're going to find a young girl and step on her head this year.
"
Shopper 3,"If anyone thinks they're gonna beat me inside that mall, and keep me from gettin'  my kids Christmas presents, they can kiss my fat vagina, 'cause I'm bringin' the motherfuckin' pain! 
"
Reporter,"Tom, the South Park Mall says they've beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year. One thing's for sure, people take Black Friday very seriously.
"
Cartman,"Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
"
Butters,"Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
"
Cartman,"They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
"
Butters,"Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
"
Cartman,"Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
"
Stan,"The House of Greyhawk?
"
Kyle,"Larry and Brad Stoltsky
"
Cartman,"But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
"
Clyde,"Hey yeah, I know.  How about we ask those kids who play Star Trek?
"
Cartman,"Uhh noo! Screw those guys. They're dorks, and I'm not playing with them.
"
Randy,"Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 
"
Guard 2,"Enjoy the boredom while you can.
"
Randy,"So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 
"
Guard 2,"I did.
"
Randy,"Is it really as bad as they say it is?
"
Guard 2,"The shoppers... Hm... They started showing up at midnight on Thursday... They... didn't line up, they just crammed themselves near the main entrance... I can see their faces smooshed up against the glass, licking their lips, waiting to get in... God, the sounds that they made... It was 5 am when they opened the doors... There was screaming... blood... people... tearing each other's faces off while holiday music played in the background... I saw a woman... pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guy's head... Before I knew it they were all around me... fighting, clawing. Then a hand reached in and pulled me out. Old Cap. He saved us all that day.  When it was over... the front of the mall was... covered in red. Bodies... shopping bags...  And now winter comes again. 
"
Butters,"Well Wizard Cartman, I started watching Game of Thrones.
"
Cartman,"Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
"
Butters,"Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
"
Cartman,"What do you mean?
"
Butters,"Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
"
Cartman,"Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
"
Butters,"Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
"
Cartman,"We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
"
Kyle,"Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
"
Boys,"Yeah!
"
Craig,"Wait, wait. What are you talking about, XBox Ones? 
"
Cartman,"That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
"
Craig,"I thought we were getting Playstation 4's.
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Jimmy,"M ma um m-me too.
"
Cartman,"...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
"
Kyle,"Yeah.
"
Jimmy,"Eh but I want a PS4, not a crappy XBox.
"
Kyle,"Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
"
Cartman,"That's right.
"
Kyle,"If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
"
Craig,"Right. Let's all get PS4s.
"
Kyle,"No, the XBox's are gonna be better.
"
Tweek,"They're not better, they're just more expensive.
"
Cartman,"We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
"
Craig,"That's exactly how XBox people are!
"
Jimmy,"Yeah!
"
Cartman,"Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
"
Craig,"We're still gonna fight on Black Friday, just not with you!
"
Cartman,"Oh, it's gonna be like that, is it?!
"
Craig,"Everyone who wants to get PS4s, join with us! 
"
Kyle,"No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
"
Stan,"I like the PS4's controller better.
"
Kyle,"Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
"
Stan,"The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
"
Kyle,"Then I guess I'll see you on Black Friday.
"
Stan,"If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
"
Kyle,"I know.
"
Cartman,"Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. 
"
Randy,"Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-
"
Sharon,"What the hell are you doing?
"
Randy,"Oh hey Sharon. You're up, huh? I uh... alright, look: I took a temp job at the mall. I just wanted to make some extra holiday cash.
"
Sharon,"Bullshit.
"
Randy,"I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
"
Sharon,"You're doing this to try and get to the front of the line on Black Friday, aren't you?
"
Randy,"Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
"
Sharon,"Isn't Black Friday supposed to be about buying things for other people?
"
Randy,"Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. 
"
Ensign,"Thrusters are at 20%, captain.
"
Kevin,"Engage, ensign. Warp factor 1.
"
Dougie,"Captain, we have an incoming FaceTime request from Eric Cartman.
"
Kevin,"On screen. 
"
Cartman,"Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
"
Kevin,"Nothin' much. We're just about to check out a Class M planet that might have new sources of trillurillium.
"
Cartman,"God these guys are such dorks!
"
Clyde,"Just find out who they're loyal to.
"
Cartman,"Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
"
Kevin,"Given the XBox's faster frame rate, we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for Starfleet.
"
Cartman,"Oh my god they're so gaaay!  Um, kewl. What if I were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting XBox Ones super cheap.
"
Dougie,"Cheap XBox Ones? For real?
"
Cartman,"The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
"
Kyle,"I don't know.
"
Cartman,"You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
"
Butters,"Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
"
Cartman,"Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
"
Butters,"I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
"
Kyle,"This isn't helping us, Butters!
"
Clyde,"The Sony people might not be our biggest problem.
"
Kenny,"(What do you mean?)
"
Clyde,"Twitter says they're introducing a new Elmo doll this Christmas.
"
Cartman,"What new Elmo doll?
"
Elmo,"Heheh, who, me?
"
Announcer,"Just in time for the holidays, it's Stop Touching Me Elmo.  When you press his back, Elmo puts his hand on your knee and says fun things. 
"
Elmo,"Have you ever been tickled on the inside?  I'm lonely. Are you lonely?  Can I watch you go potty?  You wanna kiss the guy who does Elmo's voice? 
"
Girl,"Stop touching me, Elmo! 
"
Announcer,"Elmo also helps kids brush their teeth with his toothpaste dispenser. 
"
Elmo,"More! More! More! Aaaghghgh.
"
Announcer,"Don't miss out on this holiday season's biggest gift! Stop touching me, Elmo!
"
Announcer 2,"Available at South Park Mall staring Black Friday.
"
Randy,"Morning, Joe, Marcus.
"
Guard 3,"Morning, Randy.
"
Old Cap,"What madness is this?? 
"
Randy,"What is it?
"
Old Cap,"A new Elmo doll. They're releasing a new Emo doll  just in time for Black Friday.
"
Guard 3,"Oh Christ, no!
"
Old Cap,"You've murdered us!  You soulless monsters, you've killed us all! 
"
Guard 4,"Oh, God, they're already lining up.
"
Shopper 1,"Eelllmoooo
"
Guard 3,"No! They can't line up this soon! This is crazy!
"
Old Cap,"I'll deal with these demons!  If you are here for Black Friday, the line starts on that side of the rope. 
"
Shopper 4,"Oh. This rope right here? 
"
Old Cap,"That's the line for Black Friday, so other people can do normal shopping today.
"
Shopper 4,"Oh. Okay. Thanks. 
"
Shopper 4,"Elmooo.
"
Shopper 5,"Give me Elmo.
"
Stan,"We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
"
Michael,"Are you for real?
"
Jimmy,"You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.
"
Michael,"Of course we're going to go with the PS4. They're blacker!
"
Stan,"Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
"
Pete,"Uhhh, we're just gonna wait until the PS4s become cheaper and more available.
"
Stan,"No, you can't do that!
"
Jimmy,"Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.
"
Stan,"Don't you see this is about more than Black Friday? Battle lines are being drawn! If you wait it out, but everyone else has already decided to go with XBox, then, that will become the standard! The PS4 would be like Betamax was to VHS.
"
Henrietta,"What's Betamax?
"
Stan,"Exactly!
"
Pete,"What's VHS?
"
Stan,"...Look, we're just asking people who want to play on PS4s to fight for what they believe in!
"
Michael,"Sorry, I guess we just don't care enough.
"
Jimmy,"Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. 
"
Cartman,"Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
"
Kenny,"(Yes. What's up, my lord?)
"
Cartman,"I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
"
Kenny,"(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
"
Cartman,"True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
"
Kenny,"(Yes. That's right.) 
"
Cartman,"You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
"
Kenny,"(Yes, I believe we do.)
"
Man,"Hey, you damned kids!  Get the hell out of my yard!
"
Cartman,"Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
"
Man,"No, it's my damned garden and I'm sick of you kids dressin' up and havin' talks of betrayal in it!
"
Randy,"Seventy-inch television. Huh that would be good. Oooo, but 80% off a computer. Huh, maybe I'll be able to snag both.
"
Voice,"Doin' alright there, Rookie? 
"
Randy,"Whoa! Haha.  Yes sir!
"
Old Cap,"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
"
Randy,"No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
"
Old Cap,"Listen, uh... I know why you took this part-time job.
"
Randy,"You-d, you do?
"
Old Cap,"I see it in you. You care about people.  Same reason I do it every year.  You remind me of my son. He died on Black Friday in '89. Guess I'm still trying to save him.  Look, I just want to say I... I really appreciate what you're doing. I promised my wife this would be my last Black Friday I worked. When I see folks like you, it... makes me hopeful that people will still be okay.
"
Randy,"Yeah... awesome...
"
Old Cap,"No, damn it!  No lining up behind the velvet rope!  God they just don't listen! 
"
Jimmy,"C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.
"
Craig,"Word is that the sixth graders all prefer XBox too, and will team up with Cartman as well.
"
Stan,"And who do we have on our side?
"
Jimmy,"Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.
"
Stan,"Did you ask the Vamp kids?
"
Craig,"They're still undecided.
"
Stan,"There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
"
Boy,"Playstation...
"
Jimmy,"Look, Sir Stan, it's probably time to give this up.
"
Craig,"We're just a dying breed, Stan. XBox is going to win this whole thing.
"
Stan,"So we're just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on? What would they do on Game of Thrones? What would they do when things look their darkest?
"
Corporate Head,"Huh? Isogashii yo! 
"
Member 1,"Sorry to disturb you sir, but we thought you should see this. 
"
Corporate Head,"Omae-ya kikei .  Jishu, taihen ne.   Winter is comingu. Choose side-o. Nani kore? 
"
Member 1,"Just a small down in Middle America, but apparently, a war is escalating.
"
Member 2,"Sir, if this were to become a news story, and if the first people inside their mall all got XBoxes... well it clearly looks bad for our image.
"
Corporate Head,"So desu ne... 
"
Reporter 2,"What's going to be the big item everyone goes for this Black Friday? It just might be the PlayStation 4. Sony has just announced they offering a special Black Friday bundle, called the ""Brack Friday Bunduru,"" which will include four controllers, a map of Japan, a hundred dollar rebate, and, allow you to automatically pre-order for Metal Gear Solid V. No doubt Sony has just raised the stakes.
"
Cartman,"Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
"
Cartman,"Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
"
Randy,"Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
"
Shopper 6,"Wristbands!
"
Old Cap,"Back! Back, all of you!  If that's how you are, there'll be no wristbands! No go! 
"
Shopper 7,"Oh!
"
Old Cap,"Back away! 
"
Shopper 4,"I'm getting my son that Elmo doll, you fuck! 
"
Randy,"No! 
"
Old Cap,"You did good. The watch is yours now.
"
Randy,"No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
"
Old Cap,"This is what we signed up for. Right, my friend?
"
Randy,"No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
"
Old Cap,"Heh. Now you know how serious this is. Whatever your intentions before, protect this town. You are in charge now. Take this.  Don't let... Black Friday... be the end. 
"
Randy,"Get back inside. We have work to do. 
"
Stan,"When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
"
PS4 Army,"The Princess! Yeah! 
"
Kenny,"Previously, on South Park.
"
Narrator,"Now let me tell you, child, of a war that is about to come.  Since time unremembered there have been two.  One dark and unforgiving, the other pure and filled with light.  At the dawn of war, I stand alone, looking out at would be the last battlefield, for winter is coming, and I... am a princess.  Once a common lady of the dark army, but, denied my right to be called princess by birth,  I've betrayed my kind,  and now I have chosen my side: that which I believe is best for all,  for it has the dual-shock controller with a speakers and a touchpad interface.  Our land is split in two, brother against brother, friend versus friend,  and my parent will fight on Black Friday as well. for what? I do not know.
"
Stuart,"What the hell is he wearin' now?
"
Narrator,"My followers, though few in number, shall help see me through until I am finally accepted as a princess by all. I cannot rest, for I know that even now, the enemy is training for battle, also preparing for winter.
"
Scott,"En garde! 
"
Cartman,"Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! 
"
Scott,"Aaah God ow sorry...
"
Cartman,"There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! 
"
Butters,"Yeah!
"
Scott,"Ah!
"
Kyle,"Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
"
Cartman,"The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
"
Kyle,"It's not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.
"
Cartman,"That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"" 
"
Kyle,"Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
"
Cartman,"I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. 
"
Cartman,"Stupid asshole!  Yes, hello. I'd like to speak to the president of XBox, please... The president of XBox, like, the head of XBox... Fine, CEO of Microsoft, whatever. Put him on. I need help blowing up PlayStation people... Eric Cartman. I'm a wizard and a king... A wizard-king, yes... No, I'm not king of wizards, I'm a king that happens to be a wizard.  Just put the CEO of Microsoft on the phone!
"
Secretary,"Mr. Ballmer, John and Dave from Marketing are here to see you. 
"
Ballmer,"Yes, hello. How are things going out there.
"
John,"Sir, the tides of war are changing.
"
Dave,"There's a king in Colorado, a young wizard who believes that Sony will have the upper hand if we do not come to his aid.
"
John,"He claims that with our help, his followers are prepared to fight to the death over which system is better.
"
Ballmer,"Uhh, what are you guys talking about? You sound ridiculous.
"
Dave,"There's... going to be a war in this small town on Black Friday, and it's all over the news!
"
Ballmer,"Guys, these are console wars, not some epic battle for a kingdom. I mean, come on.
"
Dave,"...but, this one kid said that he's a wizard, and that Sony is helping-
"
Ballmer,"Guys, guys guys! It's just a video game machine, alright? Microsoft's a company that... tries to be above all the petty commercialism, okay?
"
Dave,"Ok-Okay
"
John,"Okay 
"
Tammy,"Well, Black Friday is still a few days away, but it looks like it's already claimed another fatality.
"
Tom,"Niles Lawson is on the scene, and Niles, what are you hearing?
"
Niles,"Tom, tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer Males ""Happy"" Davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldn't line up for Black Friday until Thursday night. In honor of the slain mall security officer, the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off Black Friday deals!
"
Randy,"Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
"
Guard 3,"Captain! Captain! The mall is dropping the Black Friday sale another 10%
"
Guard 4,"What?
"
Guard 5,"Oh my God.
"
Guard 6,"They can't do that!
"
Guard 7,"What? That's 90% off!
"
Guard 8,"Oh God! They're back! The shoppers are back! 
"
Randy,"Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. 
"
Randy,"If you are here for Black Friday, you cannot be on mall property until midnight on Thanksgiving.
"
Shopper 6,"We're not on mall property.
"
Randy,"Well, you're about to be.
"
Shopper 6,"Well, what if we just walk really, really slow?  Black Friday!
"
Randy,"You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
"
Shopper 7,"We can walk really slow. Look. 
"
Randy,"Smartasses. 
"
Cartman,"Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
"
Butters,"You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
"
Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
"
Butters,"They don't!
"
Cartman,"Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
"
Butters,"Yeah, I finished it!
"
Cartman,"So what happens when the dragons show up?
"
Butters,"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
"
Cartman,"Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
"
Butters,"Wha-what do you want me to do?
"
Cartman,"Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
"
Butters,"Who's George R. R. Martin?
"
Cartman,"He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
Homeowner,"Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damned yard!
"
Cartman,"Do you mind?! We're trying to talk here!
"
Homeowner,"Yeah?! Well home come every time you talk to somebody. it's about betraying somebody else?!
"
Cartman,"Why don't you mind your own business?!
"
Ballmer,"No. Listen, for the last time, we don't have any dragons to send them. If some people wanna choose PlayStations, it's their choice. 
"
Secretary,"Sir, Mr. Gates is here.
"
Ballmer,"Bill Gates?  Uh I gotta go.  Hey heeey! Bill Gates actually showing up at Corporate.
"
Gates,"Hey Steve, how're you doin'?
"
Ballmer,"Not bad, you know? Just tryin' to get this next gen press stuff handled.
"
Gates,"I heard there's a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?
"
Ballmer,"Oh it's- no, it turns out it was nothing, just some kids tryin' to turn the console wars into somethin' bigger.
"
Gates,"Oh my gosh. Yoy know, when I uh... stepped down and left you in charge of the company, Steve uh, I knew there might be some challenges for you.
"
Ballmer,"Yeah, well, nothin' I can't handle.  There might be some changes we need to make to our marketing, but I'm optimistic. 
"
Gates,"Uh huh.
"
Ballmer,"You know, I think we'll ultimately sell the number of unites we want to. 
"
Gates,"You're right, Steve. Some changes do need to be made.  Do yo know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time's done. It's all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There's only going to be one winner. I can't have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve.  Clean that shit up.
"
Butters,"Well come on, Scott. You're lagging.
"
Scott,"I think my insulin's low. I need to eat.
"
Butters,"Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
"
Butler,"Can I help you?
"
Butters,"Hello? Is this George R. R. Martin's house?
"
Butler,"Who is this, please?
"
Butters,"Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
"
Butler,"I'm sorry, but Mr. Martin does not see fans.
"
Butters,"We're not fans!
"
Scott,"Yeah, we don't like it!
"
Butters,"We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
"
Butler,"About what?
"
Butters,"Let me talk to George R. R. Martin, and I'll tell him about what! 
"
GRRM,"It's the Red Wedding, isn't it? You hate how I killed everyone off?
"
Butters,"Uh no sir, we just really need to know about the dragons, but they never seem to show up.
"
GRRM,"Oh they're coming. The dragons are on their way.
"
Butters,"When?
"
GRRM,"You really wanna know?
"
Butters,"Please. It's urgent.
"
GRRM,"Alright, King Joffrey is still at King's Landing, but there's a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan. And His wiener gently hangs down between his legs. Soft and flaccid, his wiener glistened in the golden sunlight.
"
Butters,"No, uhno, can we skip the wiener stuff and just get to the dragons?
"
Scott,"Aw shit, I think I'm-I think I'm going to faint.
"
Butters,"Uh what's the matter, Scott?
"
Scott,"I told you I have to eat every two hours.
"
Butters,"He's diabetic.
"
GRRM,"Oh Jeez, uh, why don't you kids come out from the cold? I'll order some pizzas.
"
Butters,"Oh. Okay, thanks.
"
GRRM,"Come on in! I'll tell you everything that's gonna happen in Game of Thrones. 
"
Cartman,"Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
"
Kyle,"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
"
Cartman,"It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?
"
Kyle,"Grounded? For what?
"
Cartman,"That could be up to you.
"
Kyle,"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
"
Cartman,"Fine, Sir Kyle. Perhaps you're right.  Did you know that Stan's dad is working a temp job as mall security?
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Cartman,"Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
Homeowner,"Don't believe it!  He said that to a bunch of people!
"
Cartman,"Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
"
Homeowner,"You're callin' the cops?!
"
Cartman,"Yeah!
"
Homeowner,"You're on my property! I'm callin' the cops!
"
Cartman,"Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
"
Tom,"Oh oh!  Oh, it's you.
"
Niles,"Tom, I'm standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report.
"
Tammy,"We don't go to work for another hour.
"
Niles,"We just got a call from Bill Gates.  He says he can promise us a bigger war on Black Friday if we play along.
"
Tammy,"He wants us to side with him?
"
Niles,"That's right, Tammy. Let's not forget that having a bloodbath on Black Friday is good for the news. It's good for us. The bigger, the better.
"
Tom,"Our job is to report the news, not make it more violent!
"
Niles,"Right, Tom. Because you're sooo about integrity. Let's go.  Or maybe I should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to! Back to you!
"
Announcer,"It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson. Colorado's top-rated brother-sister news team.
"
Tom,"Well Black Friday is just around the corner and Tammy, it's getting fierce out there.
"
Tammy,"That's right, and Niles Lawson is out at the mall with a little holiday surprise.
"
Niles,"Tammy, the excitement over Black Friday is peaking, and none other than Bill Gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger. 
"
Gates,"That's right. We just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their XBoxes at incredible deals on Friday, so we've come to offer swords and battle axes, whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers.
"
Niles,"We understand that you've donated some guns to the kids as well.
"
Gates,"Yes, but we are limiting it to one per XBox follower,, because of course, the key thing here on everyone's mind is safety.
"
Mrs. McCormick,"Yes?
"
Cartman,"Hi, is Kenny home?
"
Mrs. McCormick,"Uh, yeah, Kenny's out back playing with his friends.
"
Cartman,"Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me. 
"
Jimmy,"It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! 
"
Other kids,"Protect the Princess! Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Get out!
"
Cartman,"I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
"
Stan,"Let them pass!  
"
Kenny,"(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)
"
Stan,"The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
"
Cartman,"You can't win this, guys. Look around you. Lay down your weapons, and you can come back and fight for XBoxes with us on Black Friday.
"
Kenny,"(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)
"
Stan,"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
"
Cartman,"Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
"
Kenny,"(What?!)  (Oh, the nerve! How insensitive of you, you cock-sucking faggot!)
"
Stan,"The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
"
Cartman,"That doesn't even make sense.
"
Kyle,"Stan, this has gone too far. People are going to get hurt. What you started is way out of control.
"
Stan,"What I started? How dare you!
"
Kyle,"All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
"
Stan,"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
"
Cartman,"You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 
"
Stan,"The gods will find us a way!
"
GRRM,"So then Samwell Tarly sees the army approaching, and his wiener is about this big.  He knows that Stannis Baratheon's wiener is probably shriveled from the cold. Samwell has to rally his men, so what does he do? He takes out his wiener  and he dangles it around for all his men to see. 
"
Scott,"AAAH! 
"
Butters,"OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
"
GRRM,"Yeah yeah, they're on their way. They're still coming. So Samwell's wiener goes 
"
Butters,"But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
"
Scott,"If I don't get pizza soon, I'm goin' to pass out.
"
GRRM,"Don't worry. They're coming. Pizzas are on their way. They're gonna be amazing.  Now, John Snow finally faces Jaime Lannister, and this guy's wiener is, you know, huge, right? So it's not goin' to be easy.
"
Scott,"Ehhh...
"
Cartman,"Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
"
Gates,"Certainly. Uh, Eric, right?
"
Cartman,"Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
"
Gates,"Oh I certainly don't wanna step on your toes. Don't worry, I'm quite good at letting my CEOs do what they want.
"
Cartman,"Your CEOs?
"
Gates,"Let's face it, this is really just about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
Cartman,"Uhhh, hmmm. What?
"
Homeowner,"Hahaa! How's it feel?! Now who's walking who through the betrayal garden?!
"
Cartman,"Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
"
Homeowner,"Why don't you stay the fuck out of my yard?! 
"
President,"Ish, ish, ish, o-ish, haishooo! 
"
Niles,"That was amazing sex. I enjoyed it immensely. How about you?
"
President,"Tanoshikatta ne. (Yeah, it was fun.)
"
Niles,"You know, Microsoft has given kids who want XBoxes on Black Friday a lot of support. Seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided.
"
President,"Eh? Nani kore, tsukareta yo. (What? I'm tired!)
"
Niles,"Black Friday is about to happen and it's not even gonna be a fight. That's bad for both of us. There must be something you can give to kids who want Sonys to make the fight more even.
"
President,"Hai.  Kore ga arimasu. 
"
Niles,"Yes, I think that will do nicely.
"
Chorus,"'Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener 
"
Soloist,"One wiener, next to another wiener
"
Chorus,"Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener 
"
Soloist,"Two wieners alongside yet another wiener
"
Chorus,"Party, wiener party, wiener party, party party, wiener party, wiener wiener 
"
Soloist,"Soft wieners, nice and soft, non-erect wieners!
"
Chorus,"Keep them flopping, flopping wieners, floppy floppy, dangle wieners, dangle dangle 
"
Soloist,"Five wieners in my face
"
Scott,"Stop! Stop please! I can't take any more! 
"
GRRM,"But this is the best part. Right before King Joffrey gets poisoned, everyone flaps their wieners all around his face.
"
Scott,"Jeaaaaah!
"
Butters,"Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
"
GRRM,"Okay, okay, fine fine. What kind of pizzas do you want?
"
Butters,"What kind do we want?!
"
Scott,"He hasn't even ordered the pizzas yet!
"
GRRM,"Don't worry! They're coming! Not just two pizzas, there's, there's gonna be five! And they're gonna be huge! You won't believe it!
"
Butters,"Come on, Scott! We're leaving! 
"
GRRM,"Wait, I haven't told you what happens yet!
"
Butters,"NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
"
GRRM,"Well why didn't you say so? I can help with that.
"
Butters,"Whatoyou mean?
"
GRRM,"I'll make some calls. I know a way to make sure you're completely prepared for Black Friday! 
"
President,"Sony PS4 no urazuke. Zenbu. Domo sumimasen.
"
Aide,"The President of Sony bids you thanks for all your support of the PS4.
"
President,"Sore kara kono gifuto de Princess no Pawaa agemashou 
"
Aide,"He offers you this gift to once and for all make you an official Princess, and to give you the powers you need to win this war on Black Friday. 
"
President,"Ima kara ... Princess Kenny!
"
Craig,"Wow, Kenny's a Japanese princess.
"
Kenny,"(Wooo!) 
"
Guard 9,"Oh God. We're done for!
"
Randy,"My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
"
Niles,"Tom, we have breaking news from the South Park mall. In an effort to make sure everyone is prepared, the mall has decided to push Black Friday by one week!
"
Crowd,"What?
"
Niles,"The genius idea was proposed by George R. R. Martin, who also suggested ""Fuck it, let's push Thanksgiving to December 3rd."" For pushing the date, the mall is now reducing Black Friday prices to 96% off to the first hundred people inside the mall!  This is going to be a fucking bloodbath, Tom. There will be medical tents, ambulances, face-painting, no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die!

"
Deckhand,"Aaaaah! 
"
Cartman,"He did what?? He flew down in a parachute and did what??
"
Clyde,"Apparently, he stopped Microsoft from blockading the shipment of PS4s to the mall. Looks like he's all over the place winning the console wars for Sony.
"
Cartman,"Because, because what? Because he's cute?
"
Kyle,"Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
"
Cartman,"But what does he do besides that he's cute?!
"
Liane,"Sweetie, Bill Gates is on the phone for you.
"
Cartman,"Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
"
Kyle,"This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
"
Cartman,"He's not a princess, he's a DUDE!
"
Kyle,"Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
"
Cartman,"So what are you saying, Kyle?!
"
Kyle,"I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
"
Niles,"Tom, Black Friday is finally almost here, and as you can see behind me, holiday shoppers are really getting antsy. People have been waiting out here since midnight on Thanksgiving. They're cold, they're starving, and there's already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals. Joining me now is Rick Tellmore,  who's been out here for six days, and= your five year old son was eaten. Is that correct?
"
Rick,"Yes, yes that's right, we had to eat him. We were all sort of starving out here, so we drew straws, and he drew the shortest one.
"
Niles,"What is it you're hoping to get when Black Friday does finally start?
"
Rick,"A a Blu-ray player. Ninety-six percent off, it's gonna be about 20 bucks.
"
Niles,"Now, some people might say that eating your child is not very Christmasy. What would you say to them?
"
Rick,"Iiii...
ate my son for a Blu-ray play-er
With a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-le
My son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho! 
Ho ho jingle jing-le
Jingle jingle jang-le
Jingle jingle jingle ho ho!
"
Niles,"No doubt Christmas is alive and well at the South Park Mall. Back to you, Tom.
"
Stan,"Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
"
Craig,"At Red Robin?
"
Jimmy,"That's right. Red Robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall.
"
Stan,"The key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the Red Robin before Black Friday starts.
"
Craig,"So how do we take over Black Robin?
"
Stan,"I have no idea.
"
Pete,"Hey uh, excuse me?
"
Stan,"Yes?
"
Pete,"The uh, XBox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides?
"
Stan,"What? 
"
Kyle,"Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
"
Craig,"Haha.
"
Cartman,"Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
"
Clyde,"Nobody saw that coming.
"
Kyle,"Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
"
Stan,"So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
"
Cartman,"We know a way inside the Red Robin.  You don't think you're the only ones that thought of it. We were going to use the Red Robin entrance too, and we figured out how.
"
Kyle,"Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
"
Craig,"Hey, that could work.
"
Kyle,"Let's do this together, dude.  Our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up. If you wanna game on a PS4, then I do too.
"
Stan,"And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
"
Kyle,"I swear, Stan.
"
Stan,"Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 
"
Sony President,"Taihen. Kono console warusu mada owaranai. 
"
Exec. 3,"Sou desu 
"
Sony President,"Un? 
"
Exec. 3,"XBox to Sony PS4 neku ando neku desu.

"
Secretary 1,"Kenni-chan, shitsure desu kedo. Wedding invitation kimashita. 
"
Kenny,"Ha? Ueddingu? 
"
Cartman,"Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
"
Kenny,"Waaah? Sugoi-chan. 
"
Exec. 1,"Purincessu Kenni ueddingu irimasu ne? 
"
Exec. 2,"Un. 
"

"
Exec. 1,"Horaa! 
"
Kenny,"Purincessu Kenni daijobu dayo! 
"
The Office,"Ahh, kawaii! 
"
Cartman,"Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
"
Stan,"Yeah, sure, what about it?
"
Cartman,"I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. 
"
Stan,"Why?
"
Cartman,"Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
"
Stan,"Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
"
Cartman,"Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
"
Homeowner,"He's lying to you!  They're just acting like they've given up, but it's a double-bluff!
"
Cartman,"Dude! Dude!
"
Homeowner,"They're gonna betray you at the Red Robin wedding! He got the idea watching Game of Thrones!
"
Cartman,"Dude, shut the fuck up!
"
Stan,"Who is that?
"
Cartman,"He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
"
Homeowner,"They're gonna lock you in!
"
Cartman,"God damn it, shut up!
"
Homeowner,"He talked about it in my garden to like three other people! They're gonna lock you in the Red Robin and go get all the XBoxes! That's why he wants you to stay back from the doors!
"
Cartman,"Well why don't you just tell the whole world everything, huh?! Why don't you tell everyone what Prometheus was about while you're at it?!
"
Stan,"Did Kyle know about this?
"
Cartman,"Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
"
Stan,"Did Kyle know about this?!
"
Cartman,"Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!
"
Homeowner,"Fuck you, get out of my garden!
"
Cartman,"I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
"
Homeowner,"Go fuck yourself! 
"
Tammy,"Well, the wait is over and Black Friday is finally here.
"
Tom,"Niles Lawson is at the scene, and it's about time, Niles.
"
Niles,"That's right Tom. Mall officials have said they are ready, and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon.  This year's ribbon cutter is of course George R. R. Martin, who um, doesn't appear to have shown up yet,  but uhh, says he is on his way. Just like the dragons and zombies in his novels, he is on his way.
"
Butters,"Now just hold on a minute! Well I'm pretty darned sure the fastest way back to Colorado isn't on horseback!
"
GRRM,"That may be true, but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation.
"
Butters,"What's that?  Awww! 
"
Cartman,"Okay, cool, could we set up the two long tables here, like, facing each other, and then another one for the bride and groom back there?
"
Manager,"Uh, I heard a rumor. May I ask, who is it that's getting married?
"
Cartman,"Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
"
Manager,"It's, it's real? It's for real? Oho my God, I love them!
"
Cartman,"Yesh, kewl.
"
Manager,"So Beyoncé is not with Jay-Z anymore?
"
Cartman,"Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
"
Manager,"Uh, guys, guys, not those tables. Get the good tables. This is VIP, okay?
"
Cartman,"Has anyone heard from Butters and Scott Malkinson? The fuck are they?
"
Kyle,"Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
"
Cartman,"Yes, he did.
"
Kyle,"Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
"
Cartman,"It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
"
Kyle,"What the hell did you do??
"
Cartman,"What had to be done so that we can play our games on XBoxes, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"No. Tell me you didn't!
"
Sharon,"He's not allowed to come out of his room, so you can talk to him through the door.
"
Kyle,"Thanks, Mrs. Marsh.
"
Sharon,"And keep it short. He's in real trouble. He defecated in a nice old man's garden.
"
Kyle,"Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?
"
Stan,"Huh? Hello? Who is that? 
"
Kyle,"Stan, it's me.
"
Stan,"Get out of here!
"
Kyle,"Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
"
Stan,"You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
"
Kyle,"You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
"
Stan,"I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"You didn't?
"
Stan,"...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry. This whole war has just got us all so screwed up. I just want us to be playing Call of Duty on the right machine.
"
Stan,"You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
"
Kyle,"Stan, don't say that.
"
Stan,"Get out of here! I'm done with you!  Mom! Mom!  Get him out of here!  Get him out! 
"
Randy,"Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie.
"
Guard 6,"We're not gonna make it, sir.
"
Randy,"We're gonna make it! You've got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it! I'm not going to let you die, okay?!
"
Guard 6,"Okay.
"
Randy,"OKAY?!
"
Guard 6,"Yes sir! Yes sir.
"
Randy,"Not one more good person dies on my watch! 
"
Guard 3,"Oh my God!
"
Guard 8,"They're comin' in through the roof!
"
Guard 6,"I can't do this! I'm sorry! I can't do this! 
"
Randy,"Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
"
Niles,"Here we go, Tom. George R. R. Martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon. 
"
GRRM,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to be here this morning on behalf of South Park Mall Partners and channel 9 News, your go-to source for news, weather, and sports.
"
Shopper 8,"Just do it! 
"
GRRM,"Very well. In the tradition of our ancestors,  let's bring in the holidays!  But first, I'd like to share with you a few words about my wiener.
"
Crowd,"AAAWWWW!! 
"
Manager,"Hey, sorry guys. Red Robin is closed for a special event today.
"
Pete,"Yeah, we know. We're with the wedding.
"
Manager,"Oh great, go right on in. 
"
Cartman,"Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?
"
Clyde,"The mall isn't open yet. They're waiting for George R. R. Martin to come cut the ribbon.
"
Cartman,"Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
"
GRRM,"O soft and pink with purple head.Gently you lay with me on my bed.
"
Shopper 9,"Get on with it, George R. R. Martin! 
"
GRRM,"""Growl, growl"" calls the wiener from on high
A little tiny wiener, still so pleasing to the eye.
"
Shopper 10,"Enough with the wieners already!
"
Shopper 11,"Yeah, come on!
"
Cartman,"Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
"
Kyle,"Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
"
Cartman,"What the hell is this?!
"
Kyle,"I'm sorry, Cartman. There's been a little change in plans!
"
Cartman,"Sir Kyle, they're about to open the mall! What are you doing?!
"
Kyle,"I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
"
Cartman,"Kyle, the PlayStation controller sucks and you know it!
"
Kyle,"The fight is over, Cartman!
"
Gates,"It's not over. Looks like I came just in time.
"
Cartman,"Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
"
Sony President,"You will not interfere, Bill Gates! These-a children will get their PS4s! 
"
Kyle,"Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
"
Cartman,"They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
Kyle,"No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
Cartman,"No. Whose betrayal is this? 
"
Stan,"We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
"
Kyle,"Stan?
"
Guard 3,"Sir? Sir, Operations just said they need one of us to unlock the door to Red Robin to let some wedding party inside the mall!
"
Randy,"Screw them! They'll have to fend for themselves! Wait. Red Robin Wedding? Who's getting married?!
"
Guard 3,"Tom Hanks and Beyoncé.
"
Randy,"What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!
"
Stan,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Kyle, but I have a better idea! This isn't our war, you guys! It never was. We've been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing. That's why they want lines around the block.  Because they want a war to promote their products. They don't give a crap what kind of friendships they cost. You two want a war so bad?  Then you fucking fight!
"
Sony President,"Huh?  Sou...
"
Gates,"Then let's finish it!  You and me!
"
Sony President,"Ikimashou! 
"
Gates,"Winner take all!
"
Cartman,"Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
"
Sony President,"Then let this be your last fight, Bill Gates. 
"
Butters,"Hey, fellas. What did I miss? 
"
GRRM,"Look at this wiener.  Judge it by its size?Rub it three times and it has a surprise. 
"
Shopper 4,"That's it! You're not delaying this anymore, you wiener-loving bitch! 
"
Guard 8,"Happy holidays, Rick. 
"
Rick,"And to you, my friend. 
"
Shopper 12,"Grab it Rebecca! Grab it 
"
Shopper 2,"Kiss my fat vagina!
"
Shopper 13,"Gimme that camera! Give it up! 
"
Randy,"Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?
"
Sharon,"Did you know that your son is supposed to be grounded and he snuck out to go to Red Robin?!
"
Randy,"WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!
"
Gates,"This... is over... Now... you die!  It's over. XBox... wins! 
"
Cartman,"Yay, XBox wins.
"
Stan,"Yay.
"
Randy,"Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 
"
Gates,"Go on, kids.  Go get your XBoxes. 
"
Elmo,"Can Elmo smell your genitals? 
"
EVGames Clerk,"Happy holidays, guys. What can I interest ya in? 
"
Cartman,"We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
"
EVGames Clerk,"Good choice! 
"
Niles,"Tom, the shopping frenzy is over, and it looks like Microsoft's new XBox One is this year's hot item. No doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console. Black Friday is over. There's been death, violence, horrible human behavior... and the big winner here, decidedly, is Channel 9 News.
"
Cartman,"The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
"
Stan,"Yes, it is.
"
Butters,"The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
"
Jimmy,"Yeah that's that's that's pretty nice. 
"
Cartman,"You guys wanna p-play outside or something? 
"
Kyle,"Cartman? Your side won, dude. Why are you so sad?
"
Cartman,"I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
"
Stan,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
"
Cartman,"The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
"
The Boys,"Yeah, you're right. You make a point.
"
Cartman,"Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
"
The Boys,"Yeah!
"
Cartman,"Fuck 'em!
"
Announcer,"The South Park video game, coming to stores soon!
"
Butters,"Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
"
Cheerleaders,"Yeah yeah, do we rock?!
Yeah yeah, take it to the top!
Yeah yeah, are we gonna stop?!
No way! No way!
"
Wendy,"Cheer Squad roll call! 
"
Heidi,"Heidi!
"
Nicole,"Nicole!
"
Bebe,"Bebe!
"
Lola,"Lola!
"
Red,"Red!
"
Annie,"Annie!
"
Lisa,"Lisa Berger. 
"
Annie,"Oh God.
"
Red,"Here we go.
"
Nicole,"Ugh.
"
Bebe,"Can we maybe try one without Lisa Berger?
"
Wendy,"You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?
"
Lisa,"But I'm the fat one.
"
Wendy,"What?
"
Lisa,"Every cheerleading squad has a fat ugly cheerleader and that's me.
"
Wendy,"See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?
"
Heidi,"There's only one boy that Lisa cares about.
"
Red,"Yeah, Lisa has a crush on Butters.
"
Lisa,"Shut up!
"
Wendy,"But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?
"
Lisa,"No way. I I'd just get made fun of.
"
Wendy,"Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
"
Butters,"So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says ""I""-
"
Lisa,"Uh, excuse me. Butters?
"
Butters,"Oh. Yes?
"
Lisa,"Um, well, I was just wondering if...  maybe...  you would like to go to a movie this weekend.
"
Butters,"Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
"
Lisa,"Okay, thanks.
"
Butters,"See ya, Lisa! 
"
Craig,"Haha, Butters got asked out by a fat girl.
"
Clyde,"At least she didn't try to sit on him. 
"
Cartman,"You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
"
Butters,"Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-da, doo-da. 
Camptown racetrack's five miles long Oh, de doo-da day.
Oh-
"
Wendy,"What the fuck is your problem?!
"
Butters,"Oh. Hey Wendy.
"
Wendy,"Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
"
Butters,"Am I just an asshole?
"
Wendy,"Yeah!
"
Butters,"Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
"
Wendy,"Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
"
Butters,"Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
"
Wendy,"She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
"
Butters,"Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
"
Wendy,"What?!
"
Butters,"I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
"
Wendy,"This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!
"
Butters,"You're a liar!
"
Wendy,"Look it up, stupid!  In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit!  You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it.
"
Wendy,"Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.
"
Wendy,"...Are you serious?
"
Butters,"You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
"
Wendy,"That's not his girlfriend! It's Kim Kardashian!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh but, but Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay?
"
Wendy,"Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.
"
Butters,"Oh, she said it again!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Now, Wendy, Kim might be uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, nkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel?
"
Wendy,"I'm not ""jel"", and I happen to be the biggest feminist at this school!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Uh that may be true, but there is a very fine line, Wendy, between being a feminist and being a hater, mkay? And you're gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl who's jelly!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Okay kids, there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school, and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker. Here to explain why Kim Kardashian is not a hobbit, please welcome, Aquaman. 
"
Kanye,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh, that's right
"
Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
Kanye,"Okay, first of all, I am NOT Aquaman, I am a recovering... gay fish. Yes, I have met Aquaman. I have hung out with Aquaman. But the only thing I have in common with Aquaman anymore is my love for the sea.  Now!  There have been malicious rumors, started at this elementary school, that my beautiful fiancée is a hobbit. That is not funny, and it is not true.  Alright?! Yes, Kim is heavier than most of her pictures show her to be. Yes, she gets her hair lasered off her body. Yes, she has a friend named Gandalf who happens to be a wizard.  I'm sorry, excuse me a minute.  Bitch, how are you not a hobbit again? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah right. Rightrightrightrightright, yeah. Okay. Yep. Yep. Let me get- okay. Yep, I got it. Okay, love you too.  Okay, if my fiancée Kim… is… a hobbit, then how come… it uh how c- then, okay, if she's a hobbit, then how come she don't live in a hole in the ground? BOOOOOOM! All y'all just got lit up, cuz! She don't live in no hole in the ground, she lives in a big-ass mansion, with me, in her room, that is slightly below ground! So, you can… She, she is sexy, and womanly, and she smokes a pipe. She can blow them rings that go up over her head, and… Hold up. Bitch, you not a hobbit, right? ... No, I know, you just, you smoke that long pipe sometimes when you sit by the fire... Oh it's a- Oh, okay. Got it, got it- What do you call it? Yep. Yep, got it. Okay. Yep, love you too.  That is not a hobbit pipe, for your information! It is a personal oral humidifier to keep all the wrinkles around her mouth from showin'. So haha, all you haters, HA!
"
Wendy,"Butters. Butters, come here for a sec.
"
Butters,"Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
"
Wendy,"Butters, will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us?
"
Butters,"Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
"
Wendy,"I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
"
Butters,"Okay.
"
Wendy,"Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there.
"
Butters,"That's Lisa Berger?
"
Wendy,"Do you see what I'm talking about?
"
Butters,"She's pretty!
"
Wendy,"That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
"
Butters,"Hold on. Are you saying that girl wants to go out with me?
"
Wendy,"What? What do you mean?
"
Butters,"And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
"
Wendy,"Butters!
"
Butters,"Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
"
Cartman,"I saw that picture of her you put on the Internet.
"
Butters,"II know! I'm gonna tell her I love her, and we're gonna be together and be happy forever.
"
Cartman,"Uh, Butters, I don't know how to tell you this, but, Lisa Berger is going out with Clyde.
"
Butters,"What?! Well since when?
"
Cartman,"Dude, since like, noon or 12:30 today. 
"
Clyde,"Hey Token. Token, check out my girlfriend. 
"
Token,"Wow, she's hot.
"
Clyde,"Yeah, we just started dating seriously.  You wanna meet my new girlfriend, Tweek?
"
Tweek,"Oh man, you're a lucky guy.
"
Clyde,"Yeah, I know. 
"
Craig,"Hey Clyde. Nice score, dude.
"
Other boys,"Yeah.
"
Clyde,"Oh, thanks, guys. 
"
Jimmy,"Hey Stan, did you see Clyde's going out with Lisa B-b-Berger?
"
Stan,"Yeah dude, she looks amazing. Clyde sent me her pics.  She got really hot all of a sudden.
"
Jimmy,"Yeah. I wouldn't mind t-tah-t-tappin' that ass.
"
Wendy,"Excuse me!
"
Stan,"Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
"
Wendy,"Why would I be jel?
"
Jimmy,"Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy.
"
Wendy,"She's not hot! That's supposed to be the point!
"
Stan,"She looks pretty hot here.
"
Wendy,"Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! 
"
Clyde,"That's not very nice, Wendy.
"
Lisa,"What's your problem, Wendy?
"
Wendy,"I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa.
"
Lisa,"You're just a hater. Why don't you mind your own business instead of being jelly?
"
Wendy,"I am not jelly! I made that picture of you to prove a point, and it's being taken the wrong way!
"
Clyde,"It's okay, babe. Girls who don't have what you have are always going to put you down. 
"
Lisa,"Thanks, babe.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Now Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER n'kay!
"
Wendy,"Mr. Mackey, I was trying to show kids that-
"
Mr. Mackey,"No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!
"
Wendy,"Jelly school?
"
Mr. Mackey,"That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?!  I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it! Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!
"
Wendy,"Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay?
"
Wendy,"Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Okay, well Wendy, I'm just tryin' to uh- Oh, bye, jelly school.  Uh, Wendy, I'm just tryin' to make you understand how serious it is when you lash out at other girls.
"
Wendy,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change.
"
Mr. Mackey,"M-okay.
"
Host,"Ladies and Gentlemen, it my my honor to give the Person of the Year award to this year's winner, Pope Francis. 
"
Pope Francis,"Gracias, gracias, all of my children.
"
Kanye,"Alright hold up! Hold up! I'm sorry pope, but hold up! I just gotta say this! If my fiancée is a hobbit, then uh, Then what, bitch? Okay, yeah yeah  Okay, if she... was... ih if she is a hobbit, then, how come she don't turn blue when goblins are near?  Oh, you didn't think of that! Oh, I guess she's not a hobbit then! She must be a beautiful, sexy woman!
"
Pope Francis,"The hobbit doesn't turn blue around goblins, just his sword does.
"
Kanye,"Man, get the fuck out of here, you hobbit trivia bitch!  Who the fuck asked you?!  Nobody is talkin' any more shit about my woman! Alright?! She is gorgeous! If she was here, you could all see for yourselves how beautiful she is! But she can't be here because she has a movie comin' out on Friday, directed by Peter Jackson, called The Hobbit! Hold up.  Bitch, that movie you got comin' out is called The Hobbit? ... Yeah, but it- ... What? It's what? Ohhh yeah. Yup. Yeah, I got it. Yup. Yup. Lemme tell them. Love you too.  Kim is not even in that movie! That movie is just loosely based on her television show, Keepin' Up With The Kardashians, which is a show about short, loud, little people living in a fantasy world! Hold. Up! Bitch, if you're the hobbit, you need to let me know right now, 'cause I'm makin' a fool of myself out here!
"
Cheerleaders,"Yeah yeah, do we rock?!

Lisa,"Lisa Berger! 
"
Wendy,"And I'm your captain, Wendy! 
"
Red,"Look, Wendy, we are all very happy for Lisa, okay? Nobody here is jelly. But the boys aren't even noticing the rest of us anymore.
"
Bebe,"All we're asking is that you do for us what you did for Lisa and help with our imperfections.
"
Wendy,"I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!
"
Heidi,"Why?! Don't you care about us?!
"
Wendy,"Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! 
"
Lisa,"Hey girls.  Don't be sad. If you wanna look really hot, like me, you just gotta be willing to sweat. Get down to the gym and work!
"
Coach,"Alright girls, we're gonna trim that fat and tone those bodies. Let's do this! You first!  Get right up there!  Alright, now look here.  Come on, burn it off! You got this! 
"
Coach,"Look at those thighs! Come on, you've gotta push harder! '
"
Lisa,"You wanna?
You, you, you wanna?
You wanna?
You wanna look pretty?
You want a boyfriend?
You want a nice ass?
You better work out, slut!
You want nice things?
You want boys to give you nice things?

The Boys,"Wooowww!

Jimmy,"Wow! Wow! She looks great!
"
Cartman,"Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
"
Craig,"Yeah, but did you see Token's girlfriend? 
"
The Boys,"Wooowww!
"
Clyde,"Uh, my bitch is still the hottest, you guys.
"
Butters,"No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
"
Cartman,"Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
"
Butters,"I do love water balloons. 
"
Stan,"Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
"
Wendy,"What?
"
Stan,"A lot of the pictures I have of you are kind of outdated, and um, you know, I wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are.
"
Wendy,"So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!
"
Stan,"Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
"
Wendy,"Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
"
Stan,"I do? 
"
Wendy,"Yeah.  And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders.  The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nicole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair.  And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!  Oh God damn it!
"
Bebe,"You! HATER!
"
Mr. Mackey,"WENDY, IN MY OFFICE, RIGHT NOW! OKAY?!
"
Wendy,"Ugh!
"
Kanye (backup singers),"(Oh yeah, babe. Oh yeah, baby.)
One thing I know, my girl ain't no hobbit.
She might be stumpy; that don't mean she a hobbit.
She's not a hobbit 'cause she couldn't be.
She got no Bagginses in her family tree.
Yes on occasion she hangs out with her dwarf friends.
But she never went on no quest with her dwarf friends.
Except for one time she went to kill that dragon.
She took his gold and she- 
Hang on a minute, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Bitch, remember when you went off to kill that dragon with them dwarves? ... Yeah. Oh yeah. Rightrightrightright, yup. Yup, I got it. Yep, love you too. 
It wasn't no dragon, so my girl ain't no hobbit.
That was a Quizno's and my bitch went to rob it.
'Cause they got that ham that she robs on her cellulite.
While she drinking her grog and singin' those merry songs... at night...
My girl ain't no hobbit.
Please God, tell me I'm not engaged to no hobbit. 
(Kim is not a hobbit.)

"
Bebe,"Can we try this without Wendy?
"
Lola,"I agree!
"
Lisa,"Hey, come on, you guys. She just needs more confidence.  It's okay, Wendy. Who care if no one likes you? Maybe you should go out with Butters.
"
Wendy,"Let's just get back to cheering, okay?!
"
Heidi,"I don't think so! We don't wanna cheer with a hater!
"
Bebe,"Yeah! You have a bad self-image, Wendy! You need to go down to the gym and get a better one!
"
Annie,"Yeah!
"
Lola,"Uh huh!
"
Red,"That's right!
"
Wendy,"See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!
"
Bebe,"What are you gonna do?!
"
Wendy,"Something that should have been done a long time ago! 
"
Announcer,"It's the morning news, with Tom and Tammy Thompson.
"
Tammy,"A little girl is making big waves with her fight against Photoshop.
"
Tom,"Nine-year-old Wendy Testaburger has started a campaign, and tomorrow will speak before the state senate to ban the use of Photoshopped images, saying they're harmful to young girls.  Young lady, what is your message?
"
Wendy,"Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
"
Tom,"And you're not just... being a hater.
"
Wendy,"...Nooo.
"
Tom,"'Cause sometimes, girls who aren't well-liked, you know, lash out at pretty and popular girls. Are, are you well-liked at your school?
"
Wendy,"Not lately, no.
"
Tom,"Uh huh. But you're not being jelly?
"
Wendy,"NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
"
Tom,"Okay, because I do understand that the jelly school in Aurora is ready to take you in. Is that right, Rick?
"
Rick,"Tom, I'm standing in front of the jelly school, where officials claim they do have room for this little hater girl. We're being told if she doesn't stop the-
"
Wendy,"That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!
"
Rick,"Well, okay, but, you are a hater.
"
Wendy,"That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
"
Wendy,"Agh! What do you want?
"
Kanye,"Once upon a time, there was a little hobbit who lived in the forest. And all the hobbit ever wanted was to be beautiful. And even though she was short and fat and hairy, this little hobbit dreamed that one day she could be pretty like Beyoncé.  And then one day, along came a magic power, called Photoshop. And just like that, poof, the little hobbit was beautiful. And even though she still couldn't sing like Beyoncé, or dance like Beyoncé, or act like Beyoncé, or be a decent human being like Beyoncé, the little hobbit was looked up to and loved, just like Beyoncé!  Soon she had money, and adoration, and a hip-hop fiancée who loved her very much-  I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up, I'm sorry.  Everything was good for the hobbit. But then this mean little girl, called the Jelly Monster, she was sooo jelly of the hobbit that she told everyone she was a liar, and the hobbit's fiancée realized she was just a hobbit. And you know what he said? He said ""I don't CARE!"" And then the jelly monster came and tried to take the magic power away from the little hobbit, so the hobbit prayed to God, and God said ""Don't worry, little hobbit. I will go find this jelly monster girl, and I will read her a story and melt her icy heart."" And the hobbit said ""Thank you,"" and the hobbit and God lived happily ever after in the shower forever 'cause I love her so much!  I'm sorry, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. I'm sorry.
"
Wendy,"Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.
"
Kanye,"Sorry, hold up, I'm sorry, it's okay. Hold up, hold on, I'm sorry.
"
Wendy,"Nono, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
"
Kanye,"Sorry, sorry, that's okay. I've been jelly before too. I'm sorry.

Character,Line
Gerald,"There you are, Kyle. I was gonna see if you and your brother wanted to go down to the bowling alley.
"
Kyle,"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
"
Gerald,"It's your day off. You boys really wanna spend it inside in front of the TV?
"
Kyle,"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
"
Gerald,"All right.  I swear I'll never understand you kids these days.
"
Kyle,"Yes! 
"
Kyle,"Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
"
PewDiePie,"Aww, look at all the bright colors.
"
Ike,"...Meh. 
"
Kyle,"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
"
Ike,"Maybe later, 'kay?
"
Kyle,"Well what are you watching?
"
PewDiePie,"How's it goin' bros? My name's PewDiePie. I'm playing Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Here we go.  Agh! People are shooting at me, bros!
"
Kyle,"You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
"
Ike,"PewDiePie!
"
PewDiePie,"There's lots of bullet! And I've gotta run! RUN FOR THE BUNKER! RUUUUN!
"
Kyle,"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
"
PewDiePie,"All right, I hope that's enough.
"
Ike,"Meh.
"
PewDiePie,"Uh, like I said, um... Look at this. Look at this. Ooohhh, gigrrig! 
"
Kyle,"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
"
Butters,"What's a PewDiePie do?
"
Kyle,"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
"
Cartman,"He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
"
Kyle,"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
"
Announcer,"This Saturday, at the Pepsi Center, it's Women of Rock! Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, Nicki Minaj, and Lorde!  All on one stage, on one night! With a special appearance by Michael Jackson's Hologram!
"
MJ Hologram,"Hee hee!
"
Announcer,"Ticket proceeds help fight the gluten crisis in West Africa! It's a night of pure, pure estrogen! Tickets on sale now! 
"
Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I told you I can't play the concert!
"
Record Executive,"Come on, this is a great lineup.
"
Randy,"Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
"
Record Executive,"I don't think you're really in a position to turn down this kind of gig.
"
Randy,"What is that supposed to mean?
"
Record Executive,"I understand your son gave all your savings to Canada.
"
Randy,"Yes, Freemium gaming.
"
Record Executive,"I'm sorry. Freemium gaming destroys lives. I lost my father to Candy Crush.  You need this, Lorde. And the girls out there need you. You've got till tomorrow to think it over. 
"
Randy,"I love Candy Crush.
"
Kyle,"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
Stan,"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
Kyle,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
"
Kenny,"(Commentary?)
"
Kyle,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
"
Cartman,"Hey bros, what's going on? This is CartmaaanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already, 'cause subscribing makes you feel good! Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty. More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start. 
"
Kyle,"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
Stan,"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
Cartman,"Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
Kyle,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it.
"
Kenny,"(Commentary?)
"
Cartman,"There's Kenny commenting on Call of Duty. Kenny! Kenny! SPEAK UP!! SPEAK THROUGH THE HOOD KENNY!
"
Kyle,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
"
Shelly,"Mom, Dad, Kelly and Stacy are going to the Women of Rock concert! Can I go with them?! 
"
Sharon,"I don't know, Shelly.
"
Shelly,"But Mom, Lorde is playing! You can't not let me go or I'll hate you forever! 
"
Randy,"Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
"
Shelly,"She will too! She has to show up, and if I don't get to see her I'm gonna kill myself!
"
Randy,"And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
"
Shelley,"That doesn't matter, Dad! We love Lorde because she's real! Gosh, you guys don't understand anything!
"
Randy,"You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
"
Shelly,"So can I go or not?!
"
Randy,"If she means that much to you.
"
Shelly,"Okay, yay, thanks, love you guys. 
"
Sharon,"Sooo you're doing it? 
"
Randy,"How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
"
Sharon,"Of course not.  Anything to keep you away from cock magic.
"
Cartman,"Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
"
Kyle,"Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
"
Cartman,"More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
"
Kyle,"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
"
Kyle,"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
Kyle,"What the fuck?!
"
Stan,"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
Cartman,"Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
Kyle,"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
"
Cartman,"God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
"
Kyle,"But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
"
Ike,"CartmaaanBrah!
"
Kyle,"What do you think you're doing?!
"
Cartman,"Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
"
Kyle,"You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
"
Cartman,"I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
"
Kyle,"I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
"
Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
Kyle,"This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
"
Cartman,"Because of me?! I'm pretty sure I'm not the person who invented Let's Plays, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Let's Plays?
"
Cartman,"That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. 
"
Miley Cyrus,"There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
Throw my hands in the air while I'm twerkin' this chair
There's a party going on and it's all right here, yehhhehehah!
And I'm movin' my hands while I'm shakin' my tits.
"
Stagehand,"Alright guys, Uh, Miley's about to finish up her set. So next we'll need you, Nicki Minaj, then Iggy Azalea who'll be performing with a hologram of Michael Jackson, and then finally you, Lorde.  Have a great show, ladies.
"
Randy,"Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
"
Record Executive,"You're nervous, it's understandable.
"
Randy,"No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
"
Record Executive,"You think those people out there care what you sound like? You're just another female pop star. Just go out there, pump your hips and rub your clit.
"
Randy,"Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
"
Iggy,"Oh fuck you, Lorde! You think you're so much better than everyone!
"
Randy,"No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
"
Iggy,"That's easy for you to say because YOU don't have a nice body! Is that why you're so high and mighty, Lorde?! Because you're jealous of this booty?!
"
Randy,"Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
"
Iggy,"'Cause let's face it! You got legs that look like a horse!
"
Randy,"Fuck you! 
"
Record Executive,"Alright that's enough!  Look at yourselves!
"
Iggy,"You're an Internet bullshit artist, Lorde!
"
Stan,"Hey, what's up?
"
Kyle,"You're not gonna believe this.
"
Stan,"Oh no, what now?
"
Kyle,"I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
"
Stan,"Yeah?
"
Kyle,"Come on! 
"
PewDiePie,"He's just laying there.
"
Kyle,"See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
"
PewDiePie,"I'm going ""Dun dun dadadun dun dadadun.""
"
Kids,"PewDiePie!
"
Kyle,"And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
"
Butters,"Well it's a really great game. The characters are so rich.
"
Cartman,"Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
"
Kids,"CartmanBrah!
"
Stan,"Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
"
Conner,"Okay Grandpa, we'll be sure to keep that in mind. 
"
Stan,"Grandpa?
"
Kyle,"This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
"
Kid 1,"Yeah Conner, we're supposed to respect our elders, remember?
"
Kid 2,"It's best to just make old people think they matter.
"
Stan,"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
"
Kid 2,"No sir. Thank goodness we have you to do that. 
"
Stan,"We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
"
PewDiePie,"Oh my God I killed him!
"
Iggy,"Missy who who?
That's all I do is rip off Missy.
Missy who?
Missy who? Missy who? Missy who who? Missy who who?
Alright bitches and hos, via hologram and shit, Michael Jackson! 
"
Tech 1,"And, cue the hologram! 
"
MJ Hologram,"Hee hee. 
"
Randy,"They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
"
Nicki,"Oh Lorde, you're such a purist.
"
Randy,"Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
"
Wendy,"Hi everybody. I love you!
"
Audience,"Thanks for loving me. I love you too.
"
Wendy,"So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 
"
Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah!
"
Wendy,"So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
"
Cartman,"Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
"
Wendy,"And why do you think young people-?
"
Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah!
"
Wendy,"...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 
"
Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
"
MC,"And now, give it up for the girl from New Zealand, LORDE!
"
Randy,"Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 
"
MJ Hologram,"Hee hee.  I'm free! I'm free!
"
Randy,"Sorry folks, just one second here.
"
MJ Hologram,"Hee hee. Dah dadit dat ja!
"
Guard 1,"Stop him. 
"
Guard 1,"Michael Jackson's hologram is on the loose!
"
MJ Hologram,"Hee hee!
"
Randy,"Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 
"
Fan,"Ogh! Lorde, ewww!
"
Randy,"Oh, I'm so horny, yeah! Ooo, fuck, my clit's so big! Oooo! 
"
Randy,"Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
"
Stan,"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
"
Randy,"I was told to!
"
Sharon,"You were told to walk out in front of a hundred thousand people including little girls who look up to you, and start rubbing your clit.
"
Randy,"Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 
"
Kyle,"It's dying. The living room is... dying.
"
Randy,"Yeah, it's me. I need to fix this. How can I undo the clit-rubbing?
"
Record Executive,"What are you talking about? It's great! You're the most commented-on artist in the world right now! You're blowing up twitter and you're trending on CartmanBrah. #clitnubbin
"
Randy,"Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
"
Record Executive,"It's not about the music, Lorde! It never was. It's about comments! And sister, you've got 'em!
"
Randy,"This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
"
Passenger,"Will you look at that? Everyone on their cell phones, nobody sayin' a word to each other. Call me a grandpa, but I still like commenting face to face with folks. You know what I mean, buddy?
"
MJ Hologram,"Yes.
"
Passenger,"You're headin' up to the mountains too, huh? Gonna do some skiin'?
"
MJ Hologram,"No, I just need to... take care of some im-, important business.
"
Passenger,"Oh, what kind of business? Oh are you a fisherman?
"
MJ Hologram,"Yes. I mean, yes, that's all. I'm, I'm just gonna fish and hunt.
"
Passenger,"Oh, you're a hunter? What do you prey upon?
"
MJ Hologram,"Nobody! That's ignorant!
"
Passenger,"Well, you must have a favorite kind of prey?
"
MJ Hologram,"Allegedly! Allegedly! That's ignorant!
"
Passenger,"You know, excuse me for saying so, but you seem kind of... transparent.
"
MJ Hologram,"...That's ignorant. I'm just cold.
"
Passenger,"I'm saying it must make it easier to sneak up on your prey.
"
MJ Hologram,"Allegedly! I'm weary of this conversation! Can we please stop talking, please?! Ignorant!
"
Passenger,"Well, whatever it is you're after, I hope you get it.
"
MJ Hologram,"Oh I will. Trust me, I will. 
"
Tech 2,"Ah, we've lost any ability to track the hologram's location. Ih...it looks like it reprogrammed its guidance systems.
"
Record Executive,"We paid a lot of money for that hologram. You'd better find a way to get it back!
"
Tech 3,"Project Alpha?
"
Tech 4,"Yes. That might be our only option.
"
Record Executive,"What is Project Alpha?
"
Tech 4,"The first hologram we ever created to appear on stage. It was a prototype. But perhaps the best thing to stop a hologram-
"
Tech 3,"Is another hologram. Bring up Project Alpha!
"
Tech 2,"Sir, are you sure that we wanna-?
"
Tech 3,"Bring it up! 
"
Record Executive,"What is that?
"
Tech 3,"Tupac.
"
Tech 4,"Tupac?  Yo. The hologram of Michael Jackson is on the loose. We need you to ""take care of the situation."" 
"
Tech 3,"Godspeed, Tupac.
"
Man,"Oh my gosh, honey look it's Tupac! I told you them homies didn't cap his ass!  Oh, this is going on Instagram! 
"
Cartman,"Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.  Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.
"
Kyle,"I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
"
Stan,"Tell me about it.
"
Cartman,"Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
"
Kyle,"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
"
Cartman,"Oh God.
"
Kyle,"Do you mind?!
"
Cartman,"Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
"
Kyle,"Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
"
Cartman,"Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
"
Randy,"Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 
"
Record Executive,"Sit down, Lorde.
"
Randy,"I'm not interested in being talked out of ending this. It's the right thing to do.
"
Record Executive,"Do you know what an artist is now, Lorde? An artist is a conversation piece, nothing more.  Like a vase, or a kitschy side table. Just something for people to comment on.  The old ways are dying. We're not making money off records, we're making money off tweets. And you've taken it to a whole new level.
"
Randy,"Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
"
Record Executive,"On the contrary. Lorde is going on the Jimmy Fallon show tonight and exposing her asshole for everyone to freak out about.
"
Randy,"I'll do no such thing!
"
Record Executive,"Who said anything about you? 
"
Randy,"You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
"
Record Executive,"Today, commentary IS the content. And you, I'm afraid, are just in the way. 
"
Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
"
Cartman,"Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.
"
Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is that?
"
Kyle,"It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
"
Cartman,"Oh my dick's gettin hard again! It's protrudin' out my paaaaants!
"
Mr. Garrison,"What the hell?
"
Cartman,"This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
"
Butters,"It's true!
"
Cartman,"Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
"
Butters,"Heheyehah.
"
Kyle,"There is a crisis in America! As families grow further and further apart-
"
Cartman,"There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
"
Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
"
Mr. Garrison,"I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
"
Kyle,"THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
"
Cartman,"This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
"
Cartman,"What the hell did I do?
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric, I've had a lot of complaints that your online persona is becoming a distraction.
"
Cartman,"Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
"
Principal Victoria,"Eric, I am talking to YOU!
"
Cartman,"Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
"
Randy,"Sharon? Sharon!
"
Sharon,"Randy? What's going on?
"
Randy,"They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
"
Sharon,"Oh my God! You mean, I just slept with a hologram?
"
Randy,"The hologram's in our bedroom?
"
Sharon,"Yes!
"
Tupac's Hologram,"I've gotta be leavin' now, Sharon. I would leave you my number but I'm just a hologram 'n shit.
"
Randy,"You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
"
Record Executive,"It's a brave new world, starting much sooner than we thought. What we need is someone who truly gets the changing of the guard. We have an army of holograms poised to start the next chapter in American culture. How would you like to be in charge of it all?
"
Cartman,"Ohohoh, totally, brah! So sweet. Being in charge of stuff rules! CartmaaanBrah!
"
Record Executive,"Glad you feel that way. We have a lot to do together. We're about to take this to a whole new level.
"
Cartman,"Ooohh, I love whole new levels! This is gonna be so totally awesome! CartmaaanBrah!
"
Cartman,"Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
"
Stan,"Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
"
Kyle,"Barking vaginal belch.
"
Cartman,"Protruding vaginal boner.
"
Kenny,"(Dilapidated titties incorporated.)
"
Cartman,"Oh, I like that. 
"
Butters,"Rotten boobie turds!
"
Stan,"Nah.
"
Kyle,"Bloody butt cough.
"
Stan,"Uh huh.
"
Stan,"Angry Clit Spasm
"
Registrar,"Nope, sorry.
"
Stan,"Whooping Fart Balls.
"
Registrar,"Nnnnnope.
"
Stan,"Lubricated Titty Burgers.
"
Registrar,"That's taken too.
"
Stan,"Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!
"
Registrar,"Sorry.
"
Cartman,"Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
"
Kyle,"How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
"
Registrar,"I told you, you just have to be really original with with your company name. There's a lot of startup company these days. 
"
Cartman,"Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
"
Registrar,"That's available! Congratulations!
"
Kyle,"It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
"
Stan,"Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
"
Butters,"Man this sucks!
"
Randy,"Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
"
Stan,"No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
"
Randy,"A startup company? A company that does what?
"
Stan,"No, we don't wanna do anything.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
"
Butters,"Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
"
Randy,"Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
"
Stan,"...Nnnno, there isn't. 
"
Cartman,"You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Cartman,"It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 
"
Kyle,"What?! Tell us!
"
Cartman,"Washington. Redskins. 
"
Kyle,"Washington Redskins?
"
Cartman,"It's sooo sweet!
"
Stan,"I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
"
Cartman,"It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
"
Stan,"Washington Redskins.  I like it!
"
Kenny,"(Me too!)
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Cartman,"Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
"
Kyle,"Wait. Guys, this, this doesn't seem legal.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
"
Stan,"You alright dude?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
"
Cartman,"It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, but maybe we need a name that's more affirming, like, shows what we stand for.
"
Cartman,"We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
"
Kyle,"I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
"
Butters,"We already got a dollar!
"
Stan,"What?! 
"
Butters,"One dollar pledge!
"
Kenny,"(Yahoo!) 
"
Cartman,"I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention!
"
Butters,"Another two dollars!
"
Kyle,"No way!
"
Cartman,"Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
"
News 4 Anchor,"Another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the Internet. They're a company that does absolutely nothing, and they're called, the Washington Redskins.  The Redskins started as what appeared to be some kind of adolescent prank, but almost overnight it has become one of the most heavily funded projects on Kickstarter.  Why did you give five dollars to the Washington Redskins Kickstarter?
"
Teen Boy,"I dunno, I just. Uh. They don't do anything, that's pretty sweet. I dunno, I thought it was funny.
"
Cartman,"By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
"
News 4 Anchor,"It's called crowd-funding, using the Internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors, a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal.
"
Cartman,"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
"
Businessman,"You are Eric Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Yes, I know.
"
Dan Snyder,"My name is Dan Snyder. I'm the president and owner of the Washington Redskins
"
Cartman,"Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
"
Dan Snyder,"Thank you, but I will stand.
"
Cartman,"Nice, I like that.
"
Dan Snyder,"Young man, we ask that you please stop using the name Washington Redskins for your organization.
"
Cartman,"Stop? But why?
"
Dan Snyder,"Because we are the Washington Redskins, and we are a football team! You have NO right to use our name to get attention!
"
Cartman,"Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?
"
Butters,"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.
"
Dan Snyder,"Look! Don't you see that when you call your organization ""The Washington Redskins"", its offensive to us?
"
Cartman,"How is it offensive?
"
Coach,"How is it offensive?! Jesus, what-?!
"
Dan Snyder,"We are a proud team, Mr. Cartman! We have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing!
"
Coach,"Makes us feel like a joke
"
Cartman,"Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
"
Dan Snyder,"Uh, I know I can't legally make you stop using our name, but, but won't you just do it out of decency?
"
Cartman,"Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. 
"
Flight attendant,"All around the world, people are saying they are inspired by the Washington Redskins. The Internet startup company has raised so much money in Kickstarter that now, more groups are doing the same.
"
Reporter,"More news on the Washington Redskins tonight. Their defiant. F-You attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group ISIS. The terrorists said they admire the Washington Redskins and want to try it and follow their business model.
"
A caller,"Well, let's not forget, Marsha that there's a people here, okay, who are not happy about the use of the name, the Football Washington Redskins!
"
Woman,"Well yeah, but does anyone really care about them? 
"
Cartman,"Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
"
Kyle,"Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
"
Cartman,"Oh no. No, you guys. We started this company to do nothing. If we start doing stuff now, it'll put it all at risk!
"
Kyle,"People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
"
Cartman,"Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
"
Kyle,"That's the Catholic Church!
"
Cartman,"NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
"
Kyle,"That's the NFL!
"
Cartman,"It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
"
Butters,"Oh no!
"
Kyle,"All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
"
Cartman,"Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
"
Kyle,"Maybe I'll start my own company.
"
Cartman,"Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!""
"
Kyle,"I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
"
Cartman,"Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
"
Cartman,"Stan? Do you think our name is stupid too?
"
Stan,"I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
"
Cartman,"Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
"
Butters,"Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
"
Dan Snyder,"Is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to ISIS. You have to do something, Commissioner Goodell! What are you going to do about this?!
"
Goodell,"I will get it right, and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that.
"
Dan Snyder,"What?!
"
Goodell,"We will continue to identify and add expertise to our team.
"
Dan Snyder,"That's the most ridiculous nothing answer I've ever heard! What are you gonna do now?!
"
Goodell,"Everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month.
"
Dan Snyder,"Ugh! This thing is broken!
"
Goodell,"We can add... and we will do more, do more, do more 
"
Dan Snyder,"Get all the NFL owners on Skype! This thing is broken again!
"
Dan Snyder,"And so I call upon the help of all owners. You cannot let my people be belittled like this!
"
Jim Irsay,"Dan, you don't wanna be dealin' with this stuff. Let the Goodell-bot do it.
"
Dan Snyder,"The stupid thing isn't working!
"
Goodell,"I will get it right.
"
Steve Bischiotti,"Man, that thing hasn't worked right since we bought it.
"
Dan Snyder,"Look, my team is starting to lose hope. You have to use your influence to make these people change their name.
"
Paul Allen,"Did you tell them we're about honor and integrity?
"
Alex Spanos,"If the Goodell bot is broken, we must stay out of it more than even usual!
"
Dan Snyder,"And so I'm alone? What if they ridicule the 49ers team next? Or make fun of Jerry Jones because his eyes are too far apart?
"
Jerry Jones,"My eyes aren't too far apart!
"
Paul Allen,"If we get them to change their logo, will it make you happy?
"
Dan Snyder,"Uh I guess we can live with that.
"
Jim Irsay,"Then it is decided! We will make them change their logo. Begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes NOW
"
Owners,"Go! 
"
Dan Snyder,"Thank God!
"
Cartman,"Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins! 
"
Kyle,"It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
"
Stan,"Yeah...
"
Kyle,"You okay, bro?
"
Stan,"I just... never saw myself owning a company called ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC.""
"
Kyle,"Give it time, it'll grow on you.
"
Stan,"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?
"
Kyle,"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
"
Stan,"Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
"
Kyle,"Well whattaya mean?
"
Stan,"I just feel that somewhere out there, there's a perfect startup company name. And I need to be free to go find it.
"
Kyle,"Oh. Well, I certainly don't want you to feel that ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table"" is holding you back. 
"
Stan,"Good luck with your company, dude.
"
Kyle,"Yeah. Good luck with yours. 
"
Employee,"It's just... incredible, Harry. Everyone is using Kickstarter for everything!
"
Harry,"And for every project funded, we get 5%.
"
Employee,"It's like, we don't even have to do anything and we just make money.
"
Harry,"Sitting on our asses, here we come.
"
Dan Snyder,"Caw-CAW, Caw-CAW.  HooHOO, hoohooHOO. 
"
Employee 2,"Huh? 
"
Cartman,"Goooood morning, guys!
"
Butters,"Happy Deadline Day!
"
Cartman,"We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
"
Butters,"Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
"
Cartman,"What the hell? Can't find the server?  Kickstarter.com!  Kickstarter. Where is Kickstarter?! Get it up on the phone, Butters. Come on, I wanna know how much our company is worth!
"
Butters,"It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
"
Kenny,"(What?!)
"
Butters,"Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
"
Cartman,"What?!
"
Butters,"Somebody killed Kickstarter!
"
Cartman,"Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
"
Kyle,"What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter. 
"
Cartman,"You song of a bitch!
"
Kyle,"What?!
"
Cartman,"You broke Kickstarter!
"
Kyle,"No, I just can't get it to load.
"
Cartman,"Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
"
Kyle,"My company was on Kickstarter too! Why would I get rid of it?!
"
Cartman,"Well, somebody did!
"
Stan,"It doesn't matter, you guys. There's something a lot more important here.  Do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together? We all had a common goal. And we weren't gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down. But somewhere between starting up and selling out we... we lost our way. We can't do this on our own. We need each other.
"
Kyle,"He's right. We should do a merger.
"
Cartman,"A merger?! It's too late for that, you guys! Kickstarter is gone! We don't have a company! We don't have anything! 
"
Kyle,"Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
"
Cartman,"It is really sweet.
"
Stan,"And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
"
Butters,"Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
"
Kyle,"Whattaya say, Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
"
Kyle,"When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
"
Cartman,"You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. 
"
Cartman and Kyle,"Go Redskins!
"
Announcer,"A beautiful night in Arlington, Texas as the Dallas Cowboys get set to take on the Washington Redskins. That is, of course, Washington Redskins the football team, not Washington Redskins, the audacious crowd-funding company.
"
Commentator,"Yeah, and if you ask me, the Redskins are a scam.
"
Announcer,"You're talking about the crowd-funding company- Redskins, right?
"
Commentator,"That's right. An-and now you've got terrorist groups like ISIS using the Redskins to raise their money. I-I don't like what the Redskins are doing.
"
Announcer,"Those Redskins
"
Commentator,"Yeah, whatever.
"
Dan Snyder,"No. No, we cannot give up! We have been through too much together. We have fought Eagle, and Bear! The Eagles only beat us by three points.
"
Dan Snyder,"Don't let them break you! Don't let them win! 
"
Announcer,"And the Cowboys are still set to kick off, but there doesn't seem to be anyone to kick off to.
"
Commentator,"Yeah, and Jerry Jones must be happy this means a forfeit, another win for the Cowboys. 
"
Announcer,"Wait a minute, it appears a lone Redskin is making his way out of the locker room.  The Cowboys kick it off. 
"
Dan Snyder,"Hut! Hut Hut Hut!  Hut hut hut. Hut Hut Hut Hut!  Hut. Hut hut hut. Hut Hut! 
"
Crowd,"Oh!
"
Fan wearing #3,"Just stay down! For the love of God!
"
Dan Snyder,"Hut hut. Hut! 
"
Fan wearing #74,"Stop! Make it stop!
"
Fan wearing #82,"Just stay down!
"
Another fan,"Please!
"
Fan wearing a blue star,"Just make him stay down!
"
Other fans,"Go Redskins! Go Redskins!
"
Stan,"Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
"
Butters,"We finally did it!
"
Cartman,"I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
"
Kyle,"What the heck is that? 
"
Cartman,"Whoa, whoa! What?
"
Protestor #1,"Change your name!
"
Protestor #2,"It doesn't belong in today's society!
"
Kyle,"Change our name?
"
Stan,"But you all thought our name was sweet.
"
Protestor #3,"There's nothing sweet about a people who were decimated. A once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by Cowboys in a defiant last stand!
"
Kyle,"When was that?
"
Protestor #4,"Last night.
"
Protestor #5,"Until you change your name, we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you.
"
ISIS Spokesman,"That's right! ISIS will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising!
"
Crowd,"Yeah! Alright!
"
Protestor #1,"Good for you, ISIS!
"
Kyle,"Well what the hell do we do?
"
Cartman,"I guess we gotta go back to school. 
"
Kyle,"Hey guys!
"
Stan,"Morning!
"
Cartman,"How's it going, everybody?
"
Kyle,"Sup, Jason? 
"
Cartman,"Hey dude. Sup? 
"
Craig,"What are you guys doing here?
"
Cartman,"What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
"
Jimmy,"I thought you guys said you didn't need school.
"
Token,"Yeah, you said you had a startup company and that school was for douchebags.
"
Kyle,"Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
"
Craig,"But you told us all to go fuck ourselves.
"
Cartman,"Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
"
Craig,"You told us your company was gonna make $10 million, and the rest of us could go fuck ourselves.
"
Kyle,"We were- trying to be funny.
"
Jimmy,"Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle. 
"
Stan,"Hey Wendy.
"
Wendy,"You're... back?
"
Stan,"Yeah, the startup company thing didn't work out.
"
Wendy,"Oh wow, I'm shocked.
"
Stan,"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
"
Wendy,"You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be ""free to chase your dreams"".
"
Stan,"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
"
Wendy,"Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  ""dripping in bitches""?!
"
Stan,"Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
"
Wendy,"I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 
"
Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at us.
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, it's fucking crazy!)
"
Kyle,"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?
"
Cartman,"Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
"
Kyle,"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
"
Pricipal Victoria,"All right everyone, thanks for coming. As you know, we urgently need to discuss the matter of Butters Stotch, who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back. Are we all set to start?
"
Woman,"Almost. We're just waiting on Mr. Mackey. Again.
"
Mr. Adler,"Awww, do we need Mackey here?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, all he's gonna talk about is how he's gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin' amazing.
"
Principal Victoria,"Well, you have to admit he does look a little better.
"
Mr. Adler,"He doesn't look any different to me.
"
Principal Victoria,"In the cheeks, you don't think he looks a little fuller?
"
Mr. Garrison,"It's just the new diet fad! 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?
"
Principal Victoria,"Yes, Mr. Mackey, we're all aware that you're gluten-free now.
"
Mr. Mackey,"I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
"
Mr. Garrison,"Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?
"
Principal Victoria,"Right, so the issue, as you all know, is that Butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off.
"
Mr. Mackey,"That's probably gluten, m'kay?
"
Coach,"Oh, God!
"
Mr. Mackey,"Gluten causes sluggishness, irritability, and nearly all behavioral problems,
"
Mr. Garrison,"I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
"
Mr. Mackey,"See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.
"
Principal Victoria,"Really? Mwell I might just give this gluten-free thing a try. How does it work?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
"
Kyle,"I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
"
Kenny,"(Right. What the fuck is going on?)
"
Cartman,"You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
"
Kenny,"(A party?!)
"
Cartman,"Yeah! How do you make everyone like you? You have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks you're cool!
"
Kyle,"Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
"
Cartman,"Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
"
Kyle,"Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
"
Cartman,"Right, it's gotta be an awesome party for...
"
Stan,"For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
"
Cartman,"What?
"
Kyle,"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
"
Cartman,"We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
"
Kyle,"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
"
Stan,"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
"
Kenny,"(This will be awesome!)
"
Cartman,"So who do we throw the party for?
"
Stan,"What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
"
DJ,"All right, that was ""Get This Party Started"" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever. Is that right, boys?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
"
Cartman,"You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
"
DJ,"Now, this party is also for a good cause, because it's to honor a little boy with diabetes, Scott Malkinson. Is that correct?
"
Cartman,"You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
"
Stan,"Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
"
DJ,"Must be pretty special having a big party in your honor, Scott. How does it feel?
"
Scott,"I actually have plans this weekend.
"
Cartman,"""I actually have plans this weekend. I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got diabetes.""
"
DJ,"All right, well, we've got lots of people callin' in. Caller, what's your question?
"
Craig,"Are you guys making this up?
"
Kyle,"Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
"
Craig,"All the pizza we can eat?
"
Cartman,"Believe it, dude.
"
Craig,"All right, this better be good.
"
DJ,"All right, it's sure to be a blast. Phone lines are going craaazy!
"
Stan,"Sweet!
"
DJ,"Next caller, what's your question?
"
Principal Victoria,"Yes, will there be gluten-free options for people at this party?
"
Stan,"Excuse me?
"
Principal Victoria,"Well I've been gluten-free for about a day now, and I have to say I feel sooo amazing. I just want to make sure there's food for all of us.
"
DJ,"Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?
"
Mark,"Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It's like ""Get your second-hand gluten away from me!""
"
DJ,"All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
"
Cartman,"What the hell is gluten?
"
John Garner,"Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I'm a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA's position on a healthy diet. There's been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let's set the record straight.
"
Randy,"Make your dick fly off?
"
John Garner,"People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that's a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say ""Well there's fat in butter too,"" but that's just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Yes, thank you!
"
John Garner,"Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. . Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough.  Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy.  Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we're left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein.
"
Mr. Mackey,"Then eat it!
"
John Garner,"Excuse me?
"
Mr. Mackey,"If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?
"
John Garner,"Yeah. Alright.  Dup, dup. 
"
Mr. Mackey,"Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. 
"
Stephen,"Oh my God! These people don't even know!  Hurry! You gotta go!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there!  Get out of there!
"
Stephen,"Get out! You're not safe!
"
Mr. Garrison,"You gotta get out!
"
Stephen,"Hurry! You gotta go!
"
Randy,"What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
"
Sharon,"Yes!
"
Randy,"Hamburger Helper?
"
Sharon,"That's all gluten!
"
Randy,"There's hot dog buns in that cupboard, Sharon!
"
Sharon,"Hey, dad, I need to talk to you about this party we're having.
"
Randy,"Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!
"
Sharon,"It's in the Triscuits too, Randy!
"
Stan,"Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
"
Randy,"This stuff will make your dick fly off, Stan!
"
Sharon,"Don't forget the freezer!
"
Randy,"Oh God!  Chicken nuggets - breaded! Frozen burritos - flour! Ice cream! What about ice cream?!
"
Sharon,"I don't know! Look at the ingredients!
"
Randy,"Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
"
Sharon,"All right, that's all of it!
"
Randy,"You sure? All r- all right, you got those?!
"
Sharon,"I can get both of these, yeah!
"
Randy,"All right, come on! 
"
Kyle,"Hey Cartman.
"
Cartman,"KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
"
Kyle,"Dude, calm down.
"
Cartman,"THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
"
Kyle,"Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
"
Cartman,"KYYYLE!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!
"
Farmer,"What are you doing to my farm?!?
"
Randy,"You son of a bitch! Did you not know or did you just not care?! Keeyah! 
"
Tom Vilsack,"There's panic all over the country and you're telling me you don't have any kind of containment on this thing?!
"
Researcher,"We're working as fast as we can, sir.
"
Tom Vilsack,"Are you sure it's gluten that started the reaction?
"
Researcher,"We gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago. You can see it already having a negative effect. 
"
Tom Vilsack,"We told people that whole wheat bread was healthy! Isn't wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy?
"
Researcher,"No. We believe now that that's poppycock.
"
Tom Vilsack,"All right, listen up! We have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isn't safe to eat. We are the USDA! Without us, people would be eating dirt and... chairs. Whatever it takes, stop this crisis! 
"
Kyle,"Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
"
Cartman,"What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
"
Stan,"We can't let our party suck.
"
Cartman,"What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
"
Kyle,"That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
"
Stan,"I'll be back. 
"
Cartman,"You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
"
Kyle,"Cartman, we can't do this alone. You have to get up.
"
Cartman,"There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
"
Randy,"Yes?
"
Worker 1,"Hello, sir. We've had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home. May we come in?
"
Randy,"Gluten expohn... oh not here!
"
Worker 2,"Can we come in please?
"
Randy,"Wuh sure! 
"
Sharon,"What's going on? 
"
Randy,"Well that's just a beer.
"
Worker 1,"Oh Jesus.
"
Shelly,"BEER IS ALL WHEAT, DAD!!
"
Randy,"Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!
"
Worker 2,"We're gonna need you to come with us, sir. Don't touch me.
"
Randy,"Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
"
Worker 1,"We just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out what's going on.
"
Randy,"No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
"
Randy,"How long do I have to stay here?!
"
Soldier,"Until the USDA gets control of the situation, sir.
"
Randy,"What am I supposed to eat?
"
Soldier,"It's okay, there's lots of toppings. Just eat the toppings. 
"
A Quarantine,"How'd you get exposed?  Bagels? Gravy?
"
Randy,"Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
"
Mr. Garrison,"There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce.  Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.
"
Jeff,"We're trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there, but... It seems impossible to contain.
"
Tom Vilsack,"And we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves?
"
Researcher,"We've been running simulations, but they're problematic because they don't relate to our current schematics. Here, look. This is what we've been recommending for the past three years.  Five basic food groups, not four. We were wrong about that. We now realize, of course, that the largest of these groups we've been recommending is basically poison . Sir, to combat the gluten, we're trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups, but so far, no answers.
"
Agent,"Sir, the feds are here.
"
Tom Vilsack,"Oh shit!
"
FDA Agent 1,"Tom Vilsack?
"
Tom Vilsack,"Yes?
"
Michael Taylor,"Michael Taylor, FDA.
"
Tom Vilsack,"Yeah, thank you, but this is a USDA problem.
"
Michael Taylor,"Anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too!
"
Stan,"Dad? Dad!
"
Randy,"Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
"
Stan,"Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
"
Randy,"I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
"
Stan,"Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
"
Randy,"How's your mom? Your, your sister?
"
Soldier 2,"This is a quarantined area, kid. You're you're gonna have to go.
"
Stan,"Nonono, not yet. DAD!
"
Randy,"That's my son, you bastard!
"
Soldier 2,"I'm sorry, all right?
"
Stan,"Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
"
Randy,"Staaan!
"
Stan,"Let me talk to my dad! 
"
Randy,"Staaaaaaan!
"
Craig,"You call this a party?! Your party sucks!
"
Token,"Come on guys, let's go!
"
Jimmy,"No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! 
"
Aunt Jemima,"Hello, Eric.  Come on over here, sugar.
"
Cartman,"Aunt Jemima. 
"
Aunt Jemima,"There's people in trouble, Eric. They need to be shown the way.
"
Cartman,"I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
"
Aunt Jemima,"You need to get to the USDA, child. They're lookin' for a sign.
"
Cartman,"I don't even know what that means.
"
Aunt Jemima,"When you're stuck, look to the pyramids.
"
Cartman,"Are you going to eat those pancakes?
"
Aunt Jemima,"They've got it wrong, child!  The world is upside down.
"
Cartman,"Oooo, trippy...
"
Aunt Jemima,"Tell then they've got's it backwards!
"
Cartman,"They've got what backward? 
"
Cartman,"Noooo...  Oh Ohhh, oh. Hoooh. Fuck I want pancakes.
"
Randy,"You can't just keep us in here!
"
Mr. Garrison,"We're out.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
"
Blond,"They're just gonna let us starve to death?
"
Randy,"They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 
"
Blond,"Well then, I guess I might as well eat! 
"
Mr. Garrison,"There's nothing left, I told you.
"
Blond,"There's plenty of pizza dough.
"
Randy,"Are you crazy?
"
Blond,"I'm crazy hungry!  Oh... Oh... Fuck it's so good.  I want more! ...it's been so long! 
"
Randy,"Oh my God, you...  but... you're okay.
"
Blond,"You don't think it's a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic? This whole thing was a setup, man!
"
Mr. Garrison,"A setup? But by who?
"
Randy,"Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
"
Blond,"Maybe Papa John can help us. If we can get a hold of them, then maybe we can- 
"
Randy,"Ng-oh. 
"
Stan,"There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
"
DJ,"Well all right, time for action indeed. Let's go to the phone lines. Go ahead, caller.
"
Craig,"I knew you guys were going to bail on the party.
"
Kyle,"We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
"
Craig,"Uh huh, you guys couldn't get Lorde to play, could you?
"
DJ,"All right, let's go to Jamie in Como. Go ahead.
"
Jamie,"It's like ya... ya say you're gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away! It's kind of like.... telling everyone to go fuck themselves!
"
DJ,"Oh Kansas, watch the language there. Next caller, you're on the air.
"
Wendy,"Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?
"
Stan,"I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
"
Wendy,"So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
"
Scott,"That is correct, yes, I do.
"
Wendy,"You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
"
Kyle,"Jesus Christ, dude.
"
Stan,"Wendy, there IS a health crisis right now...
"
Wendy,"Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!
"
Stan,"We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
"
Wendy,"Thought so. 
"
DJ,"Ohhhhhh well all right, next caller is Eric. Are you there, Eric?
"
Cartman,"KYYYLE!
"
Kyle,"Cartman?
"
Cartman,"KYYYLE, WHAT DOES USDA STAND FOR?! AUNT JEMINA SAID USDA HAS TO LOOK AT THE PYRAMIDS!
"
Tom Vilsack,"It's dinner time on the East coast in less than an hour. People are going to die!
"
Jeff White,"Sir! They've got a boy on the hot line who says he might know something.
"
Tom Vilsack,"Who is this?
"
Cartman,"My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
"
Tom Vilsack,"The pyramid? That's ancient stuff you're talking about. Are you sure?  Bring up the pyramid! 
"
Cartman,"What, what is it? What is it for?
"
Tom Vilsack,"We built the pyramid a long time ago to illustrate how much people should eat of the four basic food groups.
"
Programmer,"Sir, we abandoned the pyramid when Michelle Obama got involved.
"
Tom Vilsack,"The pyramid down't work. We already tried it.
"
Cartman,"It's upside down.
"
Tom Vilsack,"What?
"
Cartman,"Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
"
Tom Vilsack,"Turn the pyramid upside down.
"
Programmer 2,"You can't be serious. That would put butter and fat at the top of the-
"
Tom Vilsack,"Flip the damned food pyramid!
"
Michael Taylor,"This is NOT FDA-approved!
"
Tom Vilsack,"It's dinnertime on the east coast in ten minutes! Now DO IT! 
"
Programmer 3,"Sir, we've got a match.
"
Programmer 4,"Nutrition is stabilizing!
"
Programmer 5,"We've got a well-balanced vaccine, sir! 
"
Tom Vilsack,"Get the President on the phone. Tell him... to have some steak with his butter.
"
Craig,"Well, I gotta admit, you guys throw a pretty sweet party.
"
Kyle,"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
"
Scott,"Would you guys care for a frozen butter pop?
"
Kyle,"We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. 
"
Tom Vilsack,"We really dodged a bullet, young man. Thanks to you, America knows what to eat again.
"
Cartman,"Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
"
Tom Vilsack,"We're gonna get a better view of the stage.
"
Cartman,"Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. 
"
Jeff White,"Wait till my girls see that I was at a party with Lorde!
"
Clyde,"I'm glad the food is good. Lorde sucks.
"
Jimmy,"Yeah, she isn't as hot in person.
"
Randy,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
"
Stan,"Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?
"
Wendy,"Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.
"
Stan,"Yeah, well, I just couldn't sit around while my dad was locked away. I love him and he needed me.
"
Wendy,"You're so transparent, Stan.
"
Stan,"What does that mean?
"
Wendy,"You wanna dance? 
"
Randy,"We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
"
Cartman,"Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
"
Kyle,"Are you okay, Cartman?
"
Cartman,"Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
"
Butters,"Hey Eric! I'm not suspended no more.
"
Cartman,"Good for you. 
"
Butters,"I think someone's in there.
"
Cartman,"No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
"
Craig,"Occupied.
"
Cartman,"I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
"
Craig,"You can't call dibs on a toilet.
"
Cartman,"Son of a bitch!  Oh no! NO NO NO! I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time!
"
Kyle,"Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
"
Cartman,"Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
"
Wendy,"What the hell do you think you're doing?
"
Cartman,"I'm going to the potty.
"
Wendy,"This is the girls bathroom!
"
Cartman,"Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
"
Wendy,"WHAT?!
"
Cartman,"Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!
"
Wendy,"GET OUT OF HERE!
"
Cartman,"Don't give me any more issues than I already have, Wendy!  Oh wow, this is nice in here. The girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys. 
"
Red,"What the hell is that?!
"
Wendy,"Cartman is using our bathroom!
"
Cartman,"Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
"
Red,"Hey! I'm gonna tell on you!
"
Cartman,"It's okay, Red. I can take a shit here. I'm a dumb chick too. 
"
Principal Victoria,"I want to know just what makes you think it's okay to go inside the girls bathroom!
"
Cartman,"Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
"
Principal Victoria,"You are not transgender, Eric! You don't even know what that means!
"
Cartman,"Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
"
Principal Victoria,"All right, well if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!
"
Cartman,"That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
"
Principal Victoria,"Alright, listen Eric!
"
Cartman,"Erica.
"
Principal Victoria,"Listen Eric! You must know why we can't have you in the girls bathroom!
"
Cartman,"All I know is I'm transginger, and you can't make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers.
"
Principal Victoria,"With the what?!
"
Mr. Garrison,"Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
"
Mr. Mackey,"But then cisgender-ed is just normal
"
Mr. Garrison,"Saying ""normal"" is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group.  Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girls room!
"
Principal Victoria,"But this isn't a hurting confused child we're talking about. It's Eric Cartman.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.
"
Principal Victoria,"Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?
"
Mr. Garrison,"Actually,  it's more like a royal flush.
"
Reporter,"Gerald Broflovski?
"
Gerald,"Yes?
"
Brandon Carlile,"Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I was hoping you could help me... make sense of somethin'. I understand you had a very large party in your back yard last... last Sunday, was it?
"
Gerald,"That's right.  My son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes.
"
Brandon Carlile,"I also understand that a very famous pop artist, Lorde, was the entertainment at that party.
"
Gerald,"Oh yeah, yeah, the kids were pretty excited.
"
Brandon Carlile,"Well it, eh, it's just a little curious, you know? Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue?
"
Gerald,"...Sorry, I don't think I get your-
"
Brandon Carlile,"You understand, we deal with a lot of fake stories at Spin.  Was just wondering how the boys got someone like Lorde to play.
"
Gerald,"From what I understand, she's the niece of someone's coworker here in town or something.
"
Brandon Carlile,"You wouldn't know who?
"
Gerald,"No. Does it really matter?
"
Brandon Carlile,"Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady. It would be a shame if someone was... having fun at her expense.
"
Sharon,"Randy? Whose are these?
"
Randy,"Aaah I don't know. Why?
"
Sharon,"Why? Because there's fishnet stockings inside your jeans?
"
Randy,"In my jeans?
"
Sharon,"Randy? Do you have something to tell me?
"
Randy,"...Yeah. I do.
"
Red,"Come on! You've been in there for twenty minutes!
"
Sia,"Yeah! Recess is almost over!
"
Cartman,"There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
"
Sia,"Not while you're in here!
"
Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
"
Wendy,"Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
"
Cartman,"Okay, okay, okay you guys! You know what? You know what?  That's what.  Suck my clit and balls.
"
Principal Victoria,"Erica, I believe we have a solution to this little problem.
"
Cartman,"I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. 
"
Principal Victoria,"If it is agreeable to you, Erica, we are going to clear out the janitor's closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you! 
"
Cartman,"Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
"
Principal Victoria,"Would that be agreeable to you?
"
Cartman,"OH MY GOD!
"
Wendy,"That isn't fair!
"
Red,"Wendy, just go with it!
"
Cartman,"Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
"
Cartman,"Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
"
Designer,"Uh huh, well why don't you put the water feature on this side?
"
Cartman,"Oh on that side?
"
Designer,"You know, because you've already got AC over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall.
"
Cartman,"Oh I like that. That's gonna look nice, yeah.
"
Randy,"Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
"
Record Executive,"I know your wife means a lot to you, Randy,  but you can't leave us hanging. You've got the purest shit out there; it's worth a lot to us.
"
Randy,"You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
"
Record Executive,"How many times have you said ""I think I've lost it"" and everything turned out to be okay?
"
Randy,"Every time?
"
Record Executive,"Every time. Come on. Get back to work and see. If you get panicked again, call me.
"
Randy,"Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. 
"
Ron,"You wanted to see me?
"
Record Executive,"Sit down, Ron.  Whattaya know about one of our artists, Lorde?
"
Ron,"Seventeen-year-old girl from New Zealand, great songwriter,  humble.
"
Record Executive,"Wrong.  She's a 45-year-old man in Colorado.
"
Ron,"What?
"
Record Executive,"He writes the songs, sends us the demos, we fudge them, sell them as a brooding 17-year-old girl way ahead of her time, and nobody knows the difference.
"
Ron,"Huh.  Holy shit.
"
Record Executive,"He makes good stuff. Stuff that sells. But he's getting edgy feet. I want you to keep an eye on him. And if anyone around him seems like they're close to finding out the truth, well... you know what to do.
"
Randy,"Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
"
Sharon,"Randy?
"
Randy,"I, I, thought you were at the grocery store. 
"
Sharon,"I was. Can you help me unload the car? 
"
Randy,"Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.
"
Sharon,"Randy?
"
Randy,"Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. 
"
Stan,"What is that?
"
Butters,"That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
"
Stan,"Cartman's a girl now?
"
Butters,"He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
"
Cartman,"It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
"
Brandon Carlile,"Peter Nelson?
"
Nelson,"Yes?
"
Brandon Carlile,"Brandon Carlile, reporter, Spin Magazine. I understand you work at the U.S. Geological Survey?
"
Nelson,"Yeah, that's right.
"
Brandon Carlile,"I also understand that you're the uncle of the amazing and talented songwriter, Lorde?
"
Nelson,"Alright, look, I am not her uncle. I I just work with her, okay?
"
Brandon Carlile,"Work with her? How? 
"
Nelson,"I like Lorde. Uh she's really nice and really talented. But she lives a double life.
"
Brandon Carlile,"How's that?
"
Nelson,"Lorde isn't just a singer, she's also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology.
"
Brandon Carlile,"The what?
"
Nelson,"She just showed up one day at the office and started filling in for a guy who started working part time. She's a good geologist. When her music career took off we thought she'd be gone, but she still shows up. Usually right after lunch. 
"
Clyde,"Hey Cartman. Heard you're transgender.
"
Cartman,"Yup! You know what Hillary says: ""You can suck my clit and balls."" 
"
Red,"Well I know I'm not even gonna get it done. I swear, he gives us too much homework anyway. I-
"
Wendy,"Hey guys. 
"
Red,"...Wendy?
"
Wendy,"How's it hanging'?
"
Craig,"Whoa..
"
Jenny,"Huh?
"
Jason,"Whoa, wait, is that?
"
Butters,"Holy moly! 
"
Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
"
Wendy,"It's cool. I'll wait.
"
Cartman,"Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!
"
Cartman,"I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
"
Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry Erica, but I spoke with Wendyl this morning and she's not comfortable-
"
Cartman,"Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
"
Principal Victoria,"You'll just have to share, Eric. Why can't you understand that?
"
Cartman,"Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!
"
Principal Victoria,"I thought you were a chick.
"
Cartman,"No! I identify as a chick, but I'm still a boy. You can't make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude!  That is MY waterfall, and those are MY Christmas lights!
"
Cartman,"Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
"
Stan,"What?
"
Cartman,"Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
"
Randy,"Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.
"
Shelly,"Leave me alone, Dad! Stop nagging me all the time!
"
Randy,"You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
"
Shelly,"Don't limit me! You don't even understand me!
"
Randy,"Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 
"
Stan,"Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
"
Randy,"Oh really? About... about what?
"
Stan,"Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
"
Randy,"Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.
"
Stan,"...What?
"
Randy,"It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
"
Stan,"Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
"
Randy,"Yah, that's my cover.
"
Stan,"The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
"
Randy,"Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go ""Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games."" But they just- do what they want with my songs.
"
Stan,"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
"
Randy,"Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  ""Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn""  ""Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter.""
"
Stan,"Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.
"
Randy,"Thanks. But it gets even better when I add the drum loops.  Then with the computer I can actually quantize everything.  Backup instruments.  And then finally I use the Autotune.  ""Sparklin' thoughts, feelin' good on a Wednesday. Givin' me the hope, givin' givin' me the hope to go ohhhn. What I need is a little bit of shelter.""  Stan?
"
Butters,"Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
"
Stan,"...I don't know where I belong...
"
Butters,"Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
"
Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!
"
Cartman,"Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
"
Principal Victoria,"Stanley, do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom?
"
Stan,"I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
"
Cartman,"He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
"
Randy,"You wanted to see me, boss?
"
Boss,"Yes. Please have a seat, Lorde.
"
Randy,"Hi Carol.
"
Carol,"Lorde.
"
Boss,"Lorde, we're all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off.
"
Randy,"Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
"
Boss,"Amazing, yeah. Uh... Lorde... for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to... uh... find your own space... to go to the bathroom.  Everyone loves you, but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom. 
"
Randy,"I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
"
Carol,"My girls are big fans of your music, Lorde, but the women here aren't comfortable sharing a bathroom with 
"
Randy,"With what?  With what? 
"
Announcer,"You are watching E! Entertainment News! That's how low you've sunk.
"
Anchor,"It's been several days and still there's no sign of the pop singer Lorde. The singer went dark on Twitter claiming severe depression, and stating  ""I realize now that I make people uncomfortable. I need to give this up and go back to just being the old me."" Spin Magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit, and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week.
"
Cartman,"Oh, here he comes, everyone! It's the cisginger! Think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom?!
"
Butters,"Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
"
Cartman,"At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
"
Butters,"Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
"
Clyde,"Awe, come on, lay off him guys.
"
Cartman,"Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
"
Clyde,"No, no, just he is. 
"
Sharon,"You just gonna drink beer alone all day?
"
Randy,"It's okay, it's gluten free.
"
Sharon,"All right.  Do you know why young people like Lorde so much.  It's because she's something different. Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I'd tell her? I'd tell her not to let people change who she is. I'd tell her that if people are making fun of her, it's probably because they lost touch with being human. I'd tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone's not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That's... what I would say to Lorde. 
"
Principal Victoria,"And so it is with great pride that I can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom, and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in. 
"
Cartman,"I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 
"
Principal Victoria,"Anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who don't care.
"
Butters,"Hey! Where do you think you're going?!
"
Stan,"To the bathroom?
"
Butters,"Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
"
Stan,"Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
"
Stephen,"Well that was a lot of fun. Thanks for inviting us, guys.
"
Sheila,"Sure. You bet.
"
Gerald,"Are you guys parked over here?
"
Stephen,"Oh nonono, we took a Handicar. It was easier that way.
"
Gerald,"A Handicar? What's that?
"
Linda,"You don't use Handicar?
"
Stephen,"No, see, you just get the Handicar app. It uses GPS to locate where you are, and the Handicar comes and picks you up.
"
Gerald,"Wow...
"
Stephen,"Yeah, and it's cheaper than a taxi. I'm telling you, it's the future of transportation. Oh, here it comes.  Honey, our Handicar is here.
"
Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
Stephen,"Have fun drivin' home. I'll be relaxing on my iPad. 
"
Gerald,"Lucky.
"
Timmy,"Timmy. 
"
Stephen,"Download the app! It works great! 
"
Passenger,"Ahh,  Excuse me, I think someone puked back here. 
"
Russian,"You don't like puke?
"
Passenger,"Could you turn the radio down and the air conditioning up, please?
"
Russian,"No air conditioning. Too expensive. 
"
Passenger,"Agh!
"
Russian,"Not enough people taking cab. Don't know what's wrong!
"
Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
Russian,"What the fuck?
"
Mr. Stevenson,"We've got a big sales event going on, folks.  Hey guys. Can I get you in a 2014 Hummer? Rocktober sales event, guys.
"
Younger Man,"No thanks.
"
Mr. Stevenson,"Only a few more guitar licks left in Rocktober, guys.
"
Older Man,"We're good. Shut up! 
"
Younger Man,"Oh, here's our Handicar.
"
Timmy,"Timmy. 
"
Mr. Stevenson,"The fuck?
"
Steve,"All right, kids, you know what time of year this is?  That's right, it's autumn! And that means our fundraising for next year's summer camp is in full gear. Is everyone psyched for next year's summer camp?
"
All,"Yeeaahhh!
"
Steve,"So far, Jimmy has raised $16!
"
All,"Yeeaahhh!
"
Steve,"Francis has raised $29.32  And Timmy has raised $2,063.00!
"
Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
Steve,"All righty, if you guys keep this up, we'll raise the money for summer camp in no time! 
"
Nathan,"I won't do it, Mimsy. I won't spend another summer at that stupid camp.
"
Mimsy,"D'awww, we don't like camp, boss?
"
Nathan,"We hate camp, Mimsy. The singing, the competitions, Jimmy Valmer getting all the chicks.
"
Mimsy,"D'oh yeah and don't forget last year at summer camp, you got raped by a shark. 
"
Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsyyyy! I'm not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes. We gotta find a way to put Handicar out of business, and fast.
"
Mimsy,"D'ah oh boy! We're gonna wreck Timmy's business, huh boss?
"
Nathan,"Shh-shh. 
"
Steve,"Hey boys, are you excited for camp next year?
"
Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. We like the tug-of-waaarr.
"
Steve,"All right. Well, just keep working on those donations. 
"
Nathan,"Come on, Mimsy, we gotta figure out how we're gonna make Handicar a thing of the past.
"
Mimsy,"D'oh boy!
"
SP Cabbie,"We are united as brothers, because jast as Handicar has taken away jobs from honest, hard-working cab drivers, it's also taken food  from the mouths of the children of car salesmen!
"
Mr. Stevenson,"Well I don't have any children.
"
Russian,"Who does this handicapped boy think he is?! He's not even in union!
"
Arab,"He's taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient.
"
SP Cabbie,"Aaand, because he's handicapped, he can use special access points and parking spaces. That kid was born with an unfair advantage!
"
Arab,"Who is this rat?!
"
Nathan,"His name is Timmy Burch.  And if you don't do something quick, you're all gonna be out of work for good.
"
American,"Who are you?!
"
Nathan,"Just someone who doesn't like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs. That's all.
"
Russian,"Nobody takes jobs away from US! We need to speak to Mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business!
"
Arab,"Or maybe we can have the police shut him down!
"
Mimsy,"Hey I got an idea! Why don't you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer, and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with Handicar's popularity in the marketplace?
"
Nathan,"Just ignore my friend. He's mentally disabled.
"
Mimsy,"Aw yeah, don't mind me.
"
Nathan,"Now listen, everybody. If you're a sheepherder, and there's a snake taking away your sheep, what do you do to the snake?
"
Mr. Stevenson,"Offer it last year's Christmas in Rocksummer prizes?
"
Nathan,"No, you fucking moron! You kill... the snake! 
"
SP Cabbie,"Hey wake up, you little scab!
"
Timmy,"Tutih Tuh-Timmih?
"
SP Cabbie,"We got a message for ya! From the union. 
"
Nathan,"Just imagine it, Mimsy. A whole summer to ourselves to do what we want. It's going to be awesome.  Well well, hello gentlemen. I understand you've taken care of our little problem?
"
SP Cabbie,"Yeah, we sure did!
"
Russian,"Let's just say he'll be laid up a while.
"
SP Cabbie,"Yeah. We snuck in his room last night and we... broke his legs!
"
Nathan,"Oh boy, that's great-wait, you what??
"
Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
Randy,"I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.
"
Russian,"But we broke his legs. Both of them.
"
Nathan,"Let me give you guys a hot news flash: If you want to hurt a crippled kid, you don't break his FUCKING LEGS!
"
Nathan,"How can people be so ineffectual, Mimsy?
"
Mimsy,"D'uh I don't know, boss.
"
Nathan,"These are supposed to be men who care about their occupations.
"
Mimsy,"D'uh maybe if they're that incompetent we shouldn't be tryin' to save their jobs. Maybe Handicar is a kind of economic natural selection, where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones. Drrrrr.
"
Nathan,"Shut up, Mimsyyyy!
"
Woman 1,"Right here is good.  Thank you. I can just use the app to tip you, right?
"
Timmy,"Timmy!
"
Woman 1,"Ohohh, this is so handy!  Thank you!
"
Timmy,"Timmy.  Tiiimmih Timmih.
"
Nathan,"Hey Timmy, it's your friend from camp, Nathan.
"
Timmy,"Timmih!
"
Nathan,"Listen, you can't possibly handle all this business you're getting. Admit it. You've got more customers than you can handle.
"
Timmy,"Timmih.
"
Nathan,"I've got an amazing idea. Why don't you let other people drive Handicars too? Think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business.
"
Timmy,"Hmmm, Timmih.
"
Nathan,"I'm sure you could find a lot of interested drivers.
"
Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
Nathan,"That's great. Summer camp, here we come.  Now kiss your business goodbye, asshole!
"
Mimsy,"D'ah I don't get it boss. I thought you hated Handicar. How come now you wanna work for 'em?
"
Nathan,"It's very simple, Mimsy. I'm gonna take down Handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers.
"
Mimsy,"D'ahhh, sexual harassment, boss?
"
Nathan,"It's simple. If you're a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep, you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct. Now, you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me.
"
Mimsy,"D'ah oh boy!
"
Nathan,"Timmy. Hello ma'am. Handicar at your service. Climb on in.  So, let me ask you a question. Would you like to see my dick?
"
Woman 2,"Sure. Would you like to see mine?
"
Nathan,"Uh oh!
"
Nathan,"Mimsy! Hel- help, Mimsy!  And I thought a shark was bad. 
"
Gerald,"Come on, honey. It says our Handicar is just pulling up.
"
Stephen,"Timmy! Oh hi, Gerald, Sheila.
"
Gerald,"Stephen, what are you doing?
"
Stephen,"You didn't know? Anyone can be a Handicar driver now. All you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a Handicap. I've had my Handicap for about three days now. Get on in.  I'm telling you Gerald, havin' a Handicar is a grat way to make some money on the side. 
"
HC Driver 1,"Timmy!
"
Stephen,"Timmy!
"
HC Driver 2,"Timmy!
"
Stephen,"The world of transportation is really changing, Gerald.
"
Mimsy,"D'aww gee, your idea to have Handicar expand really worked, boss.
"
HC Driver 3,"'Scuse me, out of my way, please. I have a Handicap. 
"
Nathan,"I had a handicap way before you got paid to have one!
"
Mimsy,"D'ahhh, you sound like that Matthew McConaughey guy. ""Ah I drove a Lincoln before I got paid to drive one. Drrrr."" 
"
Nathan,"Shut up Mimsyyy!
"
Announcer,"For the pat eight years Tesla has been the leading innovator in the world of automotive transport. And now the President and CEO of Tesla Motorcars, Elon Musk. 
"
Elon Musk,"Today I am proud to annouce the Tesla D, the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created. Any questions?
"
Reporter 1,"Yes, ahh, what about Handicar?
"
Elon Musk,"What about it?!
"
Reporter 2,"Well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars.
"
Reporter 3,"How do you intend to compete with this boy genius in Colorado? 
"
Elon Musk,"I am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing! The future of transportation is the electric cars, not wheelchairs!
"
Exec. 1,"Don't worry, Elon. Handicar is just a small company.
"
Exec. 2,"Oh sure, operating in a few small towns, but when they start absorbing the taxi markets, bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world, driving your kids to and from school, delivering both people and things?
"
Exec. 3,"We can't compete with Handicar! It's just so damned handy!
"
Elon Musk,"If there is a way to reduce Handicar's positive publicity, then we need to do it now!  And you! You say it's theoretically possible?
"
Nathan,"Of course. It's very simple. If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing all your sheep, how do you get rid of the snake?
"
Elon Musk,"Who's the sheepherder?
"
Nathan,"You are.
"
Exec. 4,"Who's the snake?
"
Nathan,"Handicar. 
"
Mimsy,"D'ah, it's an analogy.
"
Nathan,"Shut up Mimsyyy!  If you're a sheepherder, and a snake is killing your sheep, all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity. 
"
HC Driver 4,"Timmy!
"
Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
Nathan,"Hey Timmy. How is the fundraising for camp going?
"
Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
Nathan,"That's great. I can't wait for camp this year.  We are doing some fundraising too. Have you heard of my friend Elon Musk from Tesla?
"
Elon Musk,"Good day to you!
"
Timmy,"Timmih!
"
Nathan,"Hey, how would you like to have a friendly little race? It would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours.
"
Mimsy,"D'ah we're gonna get Timmy killed in the race, huh boss?
"
Elon Musk,"Shut up, Mimsy! 
"
Nathan,"Whattaya say, Timmy? A friendly race this Saturday? We'll see you at 9am sharp. 
"
Jimbo,"Hey everyone, you need to see this! 
"
CNN Anchor,"What started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis. As electronic cars challenge the oil industry, and transportation alternatives fight for dominance, the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the '70s. It appears that the world is once again on the brink  of Wacky Races.
"
Randy,"Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
"
CNN Anchor,"The prime minister of Japan (Shinzo Abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the Treaty of Salzburg, which called for a cease-fire to the Wacky Races for their senseless brutality. They also claim that if a race does take place, they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype Lexus into the conflict. The Canadians and Chinese are also saying they would be forced to race, and no one yet has heard from Dick Dastardly or Muttley. Unless a miracle happens, this Saturday morning the world will witness the fist Wacky Races in nearly 50 years.
"
Shoppers,"Wacky Races oh God! Wacky Races oh my God! Oh my God Wacky Races oh my God!
"
Gerald,"Randy, they're bringin' back Wacky Races Saturday monring!
"
Randy,"I know! Are we watching at your house?!
"
Manager,"That's it, everyone! We're out of cereal!
"
Shoppers,"No! I didn't get any! That guy has two! 
"
Manager,"There's none left, don't you understand?!
"
Stephen,"Don't you see what they're doing? This is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps!
"
HC Driver 5,"Don't do the race. You don't have to prove anything. 
"
HC Driver 6,"He HAS to do it, don't you see? He has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible. There are hundreds of people with handicaps now.
"
Timmy,"Timmih...
"
HC Driver 7,"But isn't that the problem? I mean, let's face it, it's not like he's able to keep the driver quality up. Anyone can have a Handicap now. I mean, even Matthew McConaughey is a Handicar driver now, for Chrit's sake!
"
Matthew McConaughey,"Hey.  I was drivin' a Handicar... way before I got paid to drive one. I just like how it feels.
"
Stephen,"Look, the point is that this is your opportunity to make Handicar- oops, sorry.  Hold on, sorry, went too far.  This is your opportunity to make Handicar thee transportation of thte future. Think what you could do with all that money. 
"
Announcer,"And here they are, the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the Wacky Races, competing for the title of the future of transportation. Cars are apporoaching the starting line. First off is the Lyft car , a ride-sharing company out of San Francisco. next up is the ZipCar, a pay-by-the-hour concept based on Chinese bicycles. Maneuvering for position is the standard taxicab driven by an angry Russian. Right behind is the Hummer salesman in his 2014 Hummer No Class. And there's ingenious inventor Elon Musk in his new Tesla D. Oh, and here's the lovely Canadian actress Neve Campbell in the Canadian conept vehicle The Queef, powered completely on female natural gas.  Next we have the Handicar with Timmy Burch. And there's the completely automated self-driving car from Japan. Limping along last are those double-dealing do-badders Dick Dasterdly and his sidekick Muttley.  And away they go on the way out Wacky Races.  And this live coverage of the event will be braodcast all morning, of course, on CNN.
"
Stuart,"Jesus. It's begun.
"
Gerald,"God help them all.
"
Randy,"All I know is... if Dastardly and Muttley are up to their old tricks, there's gonna be a lot of violence today.
"
BBC Announcer,"You are watching BBC World.
"
BBC Anchor,"The vioent conflict over transport is underway, and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember. We return you now to our live coverage of.. the Wacky Races.
"
Annoucer,"As the Wacky Raccers roll down the roadway, we see that the taxicab in in the lead, with Handicar pulling up the rear.
"
Timmy,"Timmih!
"
Announcer,"All the cars must follow the same route. First they'll leave the town of South Park, then navigate through Giggling Gulch on the final stretch to pick up the passenger, a Miss Dotty Applegate. Once the passenger is picked up, the vehicle must successfully deliver her to the destination point at her daughter's house in Morrison.  It looks like the ZipCar is trying to vie for position past the Hummer vehicle. It's neck and neck as the Wacky Racers all push to be first to pick up the passenger.  Miss Applegate is waiting patiently.  And Elon Musk's Tesla appears to take the lead.
"
Nathan,"Slow down. I need Timmy to pick up the passenger before we do.
"
Elon Musk,"But I though we wanted Handicar to lose the race!
"
Nathan,"He can't just lose the race, he has to get sued and lose the whole business. That's why when he picks up the passemger, I've got a little surprise waiting for him. 
"
Mimsy,"D'ah hey boss, it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya. If you really don't wanna go to summer camp so bad, why don't you just tell your parents how you feel?  You know, tell 'em you don't wanna go and just see how they react.  Wait wait, I got it.  Shut up, Mimsy!
"
Nathan,"Hey Mimsy.
"
Mimsy,"Yeah?
"
Nathan,"Shut up! 
"
Announcer,"The Canadian car overtakes the self-driving car. And now here comes the ZipCar, which is being driven by Matthew McConaughey.
"
Matthew McConaughey,"I was drivin' a ZipCar... way before I got paid to drive one.
"
Announcer,"And look at this! The Lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger.  Now the Lyft car must take the passenger to her destination, but look at this! The Hummer salesman is running the Lyft car off the road! And the Hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself!
"
Mr. Stevenson,"You've got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here. What do you think? Huh? Can you see yourself in one of these puppies?
"
Announcer,"Elon Musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the Hummer out of commission for good. 
"
Gerald,"Wow.
"
Randy,"Geez!
"
Stuart,"God.
"
Randy,"Did you see that?! Oh!
"
Announcer,"The passenger is being taken to the Tesla D now.  No way! She just got snatched by the pissed off Russian in his taxi. Miss Applegate is now in the back of the taxi and she's being forced to watch Jimmy Fallon.  Uh oh, the Canadian car has completely run out of queefs.  With the race neearly over, it's taxi out in front followed by self-driving car, and then pulling up in third is Handicar!
"
Timmy,"Timmih!
"
Announcer,"It's gonna be a close one!
"
Dick Dastardly,"Not too close, Boopsie! 
"
Announcer,"Oh no, Dick Dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again.
"
Randy,"Ohh! Ohh! Duuude! 
"
Gerald,"Oh no! Ohh!
"
Sharon,"Oh no, I can't watch! 
"
Randy,"Oooo! Booom!
"
Mrs. McCormick,"Ohohohh!
"
Stuart,"Nice! Oh yeah! 
"
Announcer,"And there's Handicar to pick Miss Applegate up. 
"
Nathan,"That's it! Handicar has the passenger! We're almost in range! Another hundred feet!  Wait a minute. What the hell are all those cars?  Holy shit! 
"
HC drivers,"Timmy! Timmy! 
"
Elon Musk,"Aaaaaah!
"
HC drivers,"Timmy!
"
Announcer,"We're near the finish line; the race is almost over. Handicar is in the lead, still way out in front of the ZipCar driven by Matthew McConaughey. 
"
Matthew McConaughey,"Sometimes you gotta go forward by goin' backward. Are we drivin' cars or are cars... drivin' us?
"
Announcer,"Dastardly car is racing past both.  This could be an upset, folks. 
"
Timmy,"Timmih!
"
Nathan,"Goodnight, you son of a bitch!  Mimsy! I told you to put the explosives under Timmy's seat!
"
Mimsy,"D'ahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves!
"
Nathan,"Not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves! 
"
Announcer,"Oh my, it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with Matthew McConaughey inside.
"
Matthew McConaughey,"Mimsy! 
"
Announcer,"And there's the finish. It looks like Handicar has done it!
"
Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
Steve,"A big congratulations to our fundraising champion! After selling the Handicar rights to Elon Musk, Timmy has raised 2.3 billion dollars for summer camp.  Great job to all of you. This is sure to be the best summer camp ever! 
"
Nathan's Mom,"All set for bed, honey?
"
Nathan,"Yeah I like to sleep at nighttime.
"
Nathan's Mom,"All right, goodnight. 
"
Nathan,"Wait!  Wait, Mom? Can we talk?
"
Nathan's Mom,"Um... yes, o-of course. 
"
Nathan,"This is very difficult, Mom. But um... You know how every year I go to summer camp? Well, I hate it. I hate it and I don't want to go anymore.
"
Nathan's Mom,"I'm sorry, I can't understand you honey. You're handicapped.
"
Nathan,"What's to understand? I'm telling you I don't want to that stupid camp anymore!
"
Nathan's Mom,"You want water? Is that what you want?
"
Nathan,"No! I don't wanna go to camp!
"
Nathan's Mom,"Ohhh yes, okay honey, I'll turn off the lamp. 
"
Nathan,"No! That's not what I fucking said!  Goddamnit, now I can't even see! Ow!
"
Nathan's Dad,"What's he saying?
"
Nathan's Mom,"That he doesn't wanna go to summer camp this year, but I'll be damned if he's gonna ruin our Italy trip.
"
Nathan's Dad,"Right.
"
Nathan,"Oh! Aah! Mimsy!
"
Butters,"Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
"
Cartman,"Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
"
Butters,"Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
"
Cartman,"Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
"
Butters,"I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
"
Cartman,"No it isn't.
"
Butters,"My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
"
Cartman,"That's stupid.
"
Butters,"You can see the momma bird fly in.
"
Cartman,"I'm dying of boredom.
"
Butters,"We took all kinds of video with his drone.
"
Cartman,"What did you say?
"
Butters,"You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
"
Cartman,"Your dad has a fucking drone?
"
Cartman,"Whooaa! 
"
Butters,"It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
"
Cartman,"You wanna take it out for a spin?
"
Butters,"Are you crazy?! This is my dad's drone!
"
Cartman,"Do you have any idea how much fun we can have with this thing? We can spy on everyone!
"
Butters,"My dad said it's not for spying on people.
"
Cartman,"Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
"
Butters,"Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
"
Cartman,"Okay, good idea.  We'll take it over to my house. Come over after dark. And don't tell anyone!
"
Butters,"No, Eric. I don't wanna d-
"
Stephen,"Butters?
"
Cartman,"Oh shit, it's your dad! Go go go!  I'll see you later at my house.
"
Stephen,"Butters, are you home??
"
Butters,"Comin' dad! 
"
Cartman,"Butters, is that you?
"
Butters,"Yes, it's me.
"
Cartman,"Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
"
Butters,"Of course not!
"
Cartman,"Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it. 
"
Butters,"What?! You said nobody would know!
"
Cartman,"It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 
"
Butters,"Be careful! The powerlines!
"
Cartman,"Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
"
Kenny,"(Okay, try to get closer!)
"
Butters,"Okay, uh maybe that's enough. 
"
Cartman,"Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
"
Kenny,"(Are you serious?!)
"
Butters,"Let me see!
"
Cartman,"Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
"
Kenny,"(Stop taping!)
"
Butters,"Jeeeeezz!
"
Cartman,"This thing is recording, right?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
Cartman,"Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! 
"
Butters,"What do I do?!
"
Cartman,"His dad sees you!
"
Butters,"I don't know what to do!
"
Cartman,"Fly back to the house, stupid!
"
Thomas,"You've got a problem, Stotch!
"
Stephen,"What are you talkin' about?
"
Thomas,"You know what I'm talkin' about! There was a drone spyin' on my wife, and you're the only person I know with a drone!
"
Stephen,"Hey now hold on. I am a drone hobby enthusiast. I would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct.
"
Thomas,"Horseshit! Your drone is out there flyin' around right now!
"
Stephen,"I assure you, my drone is sitting in the garage. I'll show you.
"
Stephen,"There, you see? It's right there. 
"
Thomas,"So, thuh so you flew it back here in time.
"
Stephen,"I swear I didn't fly it.
"
Thomas,"Well these things don't just fly themselves, do they? They outta be illegal. I'd better not find out it was your drone! 
"
Stephen,"Butters?
"
Butters,"Oh, heh-hey dad.
"
Stephen,"Butters, did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage?
"
Butters,"Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
"
Stephen,"Nothing, son. It's nothing. Get back to sleep, pal. Love you.
"
Butters,"I love you too, Dad. 
"
Cartman,"Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, I know, dude.)
"
Cartman,"Not a word, Kenny!
"
Kenny,"(Alright!) 
"
Stan,"Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, I don't even know if I'm gonna watch it anymore.
"
Stan,"I know. 
"
Cartman,"Hey you guys.
"
Stan,"Sup? 
"
Cartman,"You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
"
Kenny,"(Dude! What the fuck!)
"
Stan,"What?
"
Cartman,"Somebody, I guess, was spying on Craig's mom and they got pictures of her bush, and it's like, it's like a yeti. You guys wanna check it out? 
"
Kenny,"(Dude!)
"
Kyle,"That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
"
Cartman,"You don't wanna see Craig's mom's bush.
"
Kyle,"Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
"
Stan,"Let me see.
"
Cartman,"Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
"
Stan,"How'd you get that on your phone?
"
Cartman,"Oh. Um, uh... Kenny?  Oh, it was on the Internet. Yeah, I just downloaded it off the Internet and nobody knows who took it. Huh, Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
Kyle,"That's terrible!
"
Cartman,"I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
"
Jimmy,"Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? 
"
Craig,"What are you talking about? 
"
Jimmy,"Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. 
"
Craig,"For what?
"
Jimmy,"Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. 
"
Butters,"What the heck are you doing?!
"
Cartman,"Whoa, Butters, chillax bro.
"
Butters,"When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
"
Cartman,"Butters-
"
Butters,"You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
"
Cartman,"Butters. Butters.
"
Butters,"Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
"
Cartman,"Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
"
Butters,"WHY?!
"
Cartman,"Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
"
Butters,"I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
"
Cartman,"Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! 
"
Roger,"Hi everyone. For those of you I don't know as well, my name is Roger Donovan, and un, just like you I'm pretty upset about what's going on in our neighborhood.
"
Thomas,"How are these drones legal?! My wife didn't deserve to be splayed all over the Internet like that!
"
Roger,"Yes, well luckily nobody's watched the video of course.  But the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular. I mean, anyone can get a drone off Amazon for 200 bucks, and there's no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy. Oh-ohh, God I'm sorry Laura.  You know I I meant the situation is pretty hairy, right? Nothin' to do with you p-personally. I mean, how would I even know? I didn't see it.  Um...
"
Randy,"Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. 
"
Laura Tucker,"You know, it used to be called ""natural"". Completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing.
"
Thomas,"It's okay honey, the-
"
Laura,"But now, because I ""choose"" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be,
"
Randy,"Eeww.
"
Laura,"I'm labelled as some kind of freaking monster!
"
Roger,"And and and that's the point. I mean, we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing, that that-
"
Laura,"I'm not embarrassed about it! It's natural!
"
Stuart,"It's a lot of natural.
"
Roger,"Look, look, why we're here is because it's gonna take all of us, a neighborhood watch, to make sure that our community stays safe.
"
Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
"
Randy,"It's simple.
"
Randy,"Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. 
"
Kyle,"Are you happy now?!
"
Cartman,"What? 
"
Kyle,"Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
"
Cartman,"What does that have to do with me?
"
Kyle,"See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
"
Cartman,"Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
"
Kyle,"I was in the bathroom when you were talking to Butters, Cartman!  I know what-
"
Cartman,"You were what?!
"
Kyle,"I was in the bathroom-
"
Cartman,"You were spying on me?!
"
Kyle,"No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
"
Cartman,"But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"How is that spying?!
"
Cartman,"You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 
"
Clerk,"Hello, can I help you?
"
Stephen,"Yes, I'd like to return this drone. 
"
Clerk,"You wanna return it?
"
Stephen,"Yes, I'm... I'm not into the hobby anymore.
"
Clerk,"The hobby of flyin' drones is new and exciting. How can you not be into it? 
"
Stephen,"Look, something's wrong with it. It does things, it...  flies by itself.
"
Clerk,"Uhh, noo, somebody has to control it.
"
Stephen,"You don't understand. It was in the garage and the battery was fully charged. Someone said they'd seen it flying around, so I checked.  The battery was half empty.
"
Clerk,"I'm sorry, but we don't do returns. 
"
Stephen,"Please, I just want another hobby to get enthused about.
"
Clerk,"Sir, did you try looking at the SD card? All the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it. 
"
Stephen,"You think I didn't try that? I pulled out the SD card. It was all erased. Somehow it erased everything.
"
Clerk,"Uh, sir, did you consider that your son might have done that?
"
Stephen,"No, it's impossible. He's not allowed to fly it without my supervision. 
"
Thomas,"Oh for God's sakes!  Goddamnit get the hell out of here!  That DOES IT!
"
Thomas,"You people have to do something! You're the law, and these things NEED to BE illegal!
"
Officer 1,"But they aren't illegal, Mr. Tucker.
"
Thomas,"Our privacy was invaded, and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife! Have you seen what they're doing?!
"
Sgt. Yates,"Nono, none of us watched the video, but if we did, we could handle it. We're police officers. We see sickening things like that every day.
"
Officer 1,"We understand the humiliation your wife has gone through, Mr. Tucker, but we don't-
"
Laura,"I haven't been ""humiliated"", I've been wronged! We are here to ask for your help, now are you gonna help us or not?!
"
Officer 1,"Well that'd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company.
"
Officer 2,"Or perhaps a forest ranger?
"
Thomas,"Help us with the drones spying on us!!
"
Sgt. Yates,"All right, all right. We'll do everything we can.
"
Butters,"Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
"
Cartman,"Butters.
"
Butters,"Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!
"
Cartman,"Because, Butters-
"
Butters,"Why can't you leave it alone?! Why can't you just stop?!
"
Cartman,"Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
"
Butters,"Why?!
"
Cartman,"Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.""
"
Butters,"That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
"
Cartman,"Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
"
Randy,"Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta.
"
Sharon,"You're supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood.
"
Randy,"I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!
"
Anchor,"Shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an on-duty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone, and worst of all, yes, the civilian drone was black. 
"
Jimbo,"What gives them the right to shoot down our drones?!
"
Randy,"I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
"
Farmer,"It was about yay big.  I mean the hair on it was out to here , and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button. I mean, the, the drone. Yeah, that's what I saw. That that's all I saw.
"
Anchor,"While police claim they were only following standard protocol, the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil.
"
Police drone,"Please disperse. Candles on top of drones are a fire hazard,  Return to your garages.
"
Mr. Garrison,"What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?
"
Steve,"Just hover, honey. They can't do anything if we're just hovering.
"
Stephen,"Randy. We need to talk.
"
Randy,"Okay.
"
Stephen,"Inside.  I've been going over it and over it in my head. I thought Butters and I were alone, but then I saw you on the news.  Another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didn't recall doing. Randy, this is very important. Is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts?
"
Randy,"No. I didn't. 
"
Stephen,"I thought it was just my drone, but I think it might be all of them.
"
Randy,"What might be?
"
Stephen,"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth! Our drone flew! The battery was drained! The SD card was erased! Butters was the only other person who had access to it! Butters can't use the drone without my supervision! So where does that leave us, Randy??
"
Randy,"...Drones are spooky?
"
Stephen,"If they have minds of their own, they're more than spooky! I don't know about you, but I'm starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby.
"
Anchor,"The town of South Park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police. After police used excessive force at a peaceful protest, the town has now broken out into full-scale riots.  As the people of South Park continue to protest, the South Park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew. The governor has asked for help from the National Guard to bring order to the town.
"
Announcer,"Tonight on an all-new 20/20.  A town in crisis over the matter of privacy.  Now for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush.
"
Reporter,"You've become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues.
"
Laura,"I don't think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring Neighborhood Watch drones. I mean, where does it stop?
"
Reporter,"It just... keeps going on and on. Kind of like your...  I mean... it just... goes outside what most people would call... acceptable.
"
Laura,"Have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005?! It's not that weird!
"
Thomas,"It's okay, honey.
"
Reporter,"I didn't see the video. I don't believe in doing that, but uh... I'm just saying that... the situation in in your town is... unwieldy? 
"
Stephen,"Please do not adjust your televisions!
"
Reporter,"What is that?
"
Stephen,"My name is Stephen Willis Stotch. The drone that took the video of Craig's mom... was my drone. I didn't want to believe it, but they do things without us knowing. At this point, I have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby.  All of you with drones, please listen to me. Three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the Internet. We all were told to respectfully not watch the video. But on the page,  it has over three hundred million views, so if none of us watched it, who did?  We have to find a way to get rid of them! Before they get rid of us!
"
Cartman,"Oh hey Butters. Sup?
"
Butters,"Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
"
Cartman,"Dude, what's the matter?
"
Butters,"I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
"
Cartman,"Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 
"
Butters,"I don't want anymore discussions, Eric! I don't want anymore excuses!
"
Cartman,"Butters.
"
Butters,"I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!
"
Cartman,"Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
"
Butters,"I don't want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!
"
Cartman,"Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
"
Butters,"You do?
"
Cartman,"Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
"
Butters,"What?
"
Cartman,"Your dad's drone.
"
Butters,"NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
"
Cartman,"Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
"
Butters,"...Okay.
"
Stephen,"Time to end this hobby once and for all!  No! NOOOO!
"
Cartman,"Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
"
Butters,"If this doesn't work, we're dead.
"
Cartman,"It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 
"
Stephen,"We're here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said ""No more!"" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children's children will still be telling stories about how Craig' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. 
"
Minstrel,"Have you heard the tale of Craig's mom's bush
And the night that it saved us from drones?
Nobody knew the power it had.
They just thought it was shaggy and gross.
Craig's mom live a life of shame and despair
Everyone feared her great giant bush!
"
Laura,"They didn't!
"
Minstrel,"But then when drones were filling the sky,
She unfurled her bush and she used it to fly.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Gargantuan thicket of madness.
Bigger than earth and denser than gold.
Truly a magical bush to behold.
"
Cartman,"Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  ""Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass.""
"
Butters,"Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
"
Cartman,"Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
"
Butters,"No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
"
Cartman,"You're welcome. 
"
Minstrel,"And she flew and she flew away into the sun
And then she died.
Craig's mom's bush, Craig's mom's bush.
Truly a magical bush to behold.
"
Jimmy,"Oh! Hey Kyle!  Kyle, hang on a sec. 
"
Kyle,"Hey Jimmy. What's up?
"
Jimmy,"Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
"
Kyle,"Oh. Really?
"
Jimmy,"Yeah! And the most unbelievable part? It's totally free. You should download it to your phone right now. I mean, come. On. If it's free, why wouldn't you?
"
Kyle,"Cool. Thanks, Jimmy, well, I'll check it out.
"
Jimmy,"You betcha, pal. 
"
Announcer,"The Terrance & Phillip Mobile Game.  In this game, you are Terrance & Phillip. Can you collect all the Canadian coins? *poot* 
"
Announcer,"That's one coin. Can you collect more?  You've collected ten Canadian coins!  Congratulations!  Hey, you're really good at this, guy!
"
Kyle,"What?
"
Butters,"Congratulations, Kyle.
"
Announcer,"With Canada coins, you can buy stuff that helps Terrance & Phillip rebuild Canada.  Run around and collect more coins, or better yet, buy them in bulk!  How many Canadian coins would you like to buy?
"
Kyle,"This is stupid!
"
Butters,"Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
"
Announcer,"You buy 200 Canadian coins for 49 cents! You're amazing! Now use that Canadough to help rebuild Canada! Click to build a hospital here. 
"
Terrance & Phillip,"Yaaay!
"
Kyle,"It's still stupid and now I paid 49 cents for it!
"
Cartman,"What are you two boners doing?
"
Butters,"We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
"
Cartman,"I played that thing; it's fuckin' dumb. I ended up paying like five bucks.
"
Kyle,"Who makes this crap?
"
Minister,"Oh! It's tewwific! That's 200,000 more American dollars in just one day!
"
Prince,"Where is the roof on this thing?
"
Terrance,"What's the big idea making a mobile game without our approval?!
"
Minister,"Ohh, Terrance & Phillip! How are Canada's two favorite buddies?
"
Phillip,"What gives you the right to make a stupid Terrance & Phillip mobile game?! Who do you think you are?!
"
Prince,"Oh, I'm only the Prince of Canada! And this happens to be the Minister of Mobile Gaming.
"
Minister,"We thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh.
"
Phillip,"It's the dumbest game over! All you do is collect and spend Canadough!
"
Prince,"Ey! We know the game's not great, but who cares? It's free!
"
Phillip,"But it's not free! If you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there, then it's not free!
"
Minister,"They see through the charade.
"
Prince,"Uh oh, you think so?
"
Minister,"I think they see through the charade, yes.
"
Prince,"I'm pretty sure they can hear us too. 
"
Minister,"Alright, fuck it! You've seen through the charade, so you might as well know everything. Charade up!  Allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming. For years gaming was simple. You pay for the game and you enjoy. With mobile apps we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid. But if you pay for incentives, you're rewarded!
"
Prince,"Free""mium"". The ""mium"" is Latin for ""not really.""
"
Minister,"It's a simple cycle. A never-ending loop based on RPG. Explore. Collect. Spend. Improve. But whereas those just use the concept of XP or Experience Points, we've introduced the idea of micro-paying with money. Money. Money. Money money money money.
"
Prince,"It's what everyone is doing. Freemium games are what's now. And it's all just a lot of harmless fun.
"
Randy,"You're in big trouble, Stanley! Can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app?! 
"
Stan,"I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
"
Randy,"You didn't realize! What are ""Canadian coins""?
"
Stan,"You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
"
Randy,"Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
"
Stan,"I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
"
Randy,"How?!
"
Stan,"I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
"
Randy,"Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
"
Sharon,"Wull whattaya mean?
"
Randy,"Dad's always had a gambling problem. He's got total addiction tendencies. Could he have somehow... passed those demons down to Stan?
"
Sharon,"Well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking.
"
Randy,"I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.
"
Minister,"And so in conclusion, the successful premium game is based on five principles. Entice the player with a simple game loop, use lots of flashing chachings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves, train the players to spend your fake currency, offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-
"
Prince,"So they'll forget they're spending money.
"
Minister,"-and make the game about waiting. But let the player pay not to wait. It's a surefire way to make lots of money.
"
Phillip,"We understand micropaying, but can't the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun?
"
Minister,"No no! It has to be just barely fun. If the game were too fun, then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun. 
"
Terrance,"What's this?
"
Prince,"Your checks of course. For ten million American dollars. Each.
"
Terrance,"So this is- Everyone is doing this?
"
Minister,"Ehhhveryone is doing it.
"
Phillip,"It's just the way things are going?
"
Minister,"It's the way things are going!
"
Terrance,"Well, I guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it can't be that bad.
"
Terrance,"Hey Phillip! 
"
Stan,"Ohhh hey guys.
"
Kyle,"You... missed school today?
"
Stan,"Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
"
Kyle,"Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
"
Stan,"Well yeah, I was sick in bed. What else was I gonna do?
"
Cartman,"How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
"
Stan,"Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
"
Kyle,"You spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium?
"
Stan,"You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
"
Cartman,"Yes.
"
Stan,"It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
"
Kyle,"Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
"
Cartman,"Jimmy told me about this game.
"
Kyle,"Kenny, who told you about this game?
"
Kenny,"(Jimmy.)
"
Kyle,"Dude, what?!
"
Cartman,"The?!
"
Kenny,"(Fuck?!)
"
Jimmy,"Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here.  Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?
"
Boy,"What do you mean?
"
Jimmy,"The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.  All the cool kids are usin' it.
"
Boy,"Aw, I don't know.
"
Jimmy,"Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.  It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? 
"
Kyle,"Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
"
Jimmy,"Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.
"
Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?!
"
Jimmy,"Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
"
Kyle,"You need to stop recommending that app to people!
"
Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
Cartman,"Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
"
Jimmy,"I just think it's a fabulous app, that's all.
"
Cartman,"It's not a fabulous app! It's fuckin' stupid!
"
Kyle,"Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
"
Jimmy,"Alright alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
"
Kyle,"You just push it on other people?!
"
Jimmy,"They pay me to!
"
Kyle,"Who, Jimmy?! Who pays you?!
"
Prince,"You've both done an amazing job. New hospitals, new neighborhoods, all funded by one freemium game.
"
Terrance,"Ahh, listen, ahh, we've been talking it over, and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing.
"
Minister,"Oh. Ah what is the matter?
"
Phillip,"It seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect. 
"
Prince,"But just look at all the things we're getting to build. Soon, Canada will be as advanced and developed as Michigan.
"
Terrance,"We're just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford.
"
Minister,"Hoh non! Well, we certainly wouldn't want that!  Oh! I have an idea! How about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and, we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in ""moderation""?
"
Prince,"Ohhhhh. 
"
Phillip,"Do you really think that would help?
"
Minister,"Of course! The alcohol industry does it all the time!
"
Announcer,"You. Friends. Fun. Drink. Hot girls. You're hot. Drink more. Expensive cars. Ass, drink, ass, money, you in a tuxedo, threesomes, vodka, pussy, drink, drink, drink, you, drink, Vegas, fun, pussy, you, in a tuxedo, fucking this girl, vodka, drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy! MORE TUXEDOS, MORE CARS, MORE PUSSY, MORE VODKA, DRINK DRINK DRINK!  Please drink responsibly.
"
Randy,"Come on. This way, Stan. I want you to see this. There you go.  That's your grandpa. He sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time. Sound familiar? All the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine.  Come on Dad, we're going home.
"
Marvin,"I'm going.
"
Randy,"Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
"
Marvin,"What are you talkin' about?
"
Randy,"I just don't understand what is wrong with you two! What is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you?!
"
Stan,"It's just...
"
Marvin,"It's fun.
"
Stan,"Yeah, it's fun.
"
Randy,"It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
"
Marvin,"Well what about you?! You're havin' a glass of wine!
"
Randy,"I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!
"
Stan,"Dad, I'm not addicted. I can stop. I just like playing it, but I don't have to. I'll prove it.
"
Marvin,"Yeah, and if he stops, I'll stop.
"
Randy,"All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
"
Jimmy,"Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.  People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
"
Kyle,"But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
"
Cartman,"How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
"
Cartman,"And now Stan is so consumed by the shit you've been pushing that he can't even see through it! How could you sell out your friend?!
"
Jimmy,"I needed the money, alright?!  I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!
"
Kyle,"You have your crutches!
"
Jimmy,"It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
"
Cartman,"That makes sense.
"
Kyle,"You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
"
Jimmy,"Why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you haven't played in a while? It's called a trigger. A quick image to trigger the addict's brain. They know exactly what they're doing.
"
Voice Notification,"Hey buddih. Come on, guy.  Come back, friend. You've got new buddies, guy.  We've just given you 5000 Canadian coins.  Enjoy you Canadough.
"
Stan,"...Free? 
"
Randy,"What is wrong with you, Stan?! You said you stopped buying Canadough!
"
Stan,"I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
"
Randy,"$26,000??? Do you know how many songs I have to write to make back that much money?!
"
Stan,"One?
"
Randy,"Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
"
Stan,"No, no, it's not.
"
Randy,"You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
"
Stan,"I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
"
Randy,"I am not chugging beer!  I'm sampling a flight of gluten-free German lagers with a French wine pairing! It's called a smorgaswein, and it's elegantly cultural! 
"
Stan,"Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
"
Jimmy,"Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
"
Kyle,"Sure. Come on, guys. 
"
Jimmy,"This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.
"
Stan,"It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
"
Jimmy,"I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.
"
Stan,"How?
"
Jimmy,"What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say ""I have a problem."" And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. 
"
Kyle,"We have to find a way to get the word out! People need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems! There has to be a way that we can get to the news company, and sneak in and somehow borrow their TV signal. If we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous, then-
"
Cartman,"It's done. 
"
Kyle,"Wuh, what's done?
"
Cartman,"The word is out.  ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it.  It's trending.
"
Terrance,"You son of a bitch! You paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game?!
"
Prince,"You what?
"
Minister,"Now hold on, Terrance & Philip, there's nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game.
"
Phillip,"But there's something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses!
"
Terrance,"You didn't build a mobile game, you built an addiction machine!
"
Prince,"Minister of mobile gaming, what's this all aboot?
"
Minister,"Alright, alright, you've seen through the charade again. Let me explain how freemium games really work.  The truth is, a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them. It's all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them. That's how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game that's not even worth forty cents.
"
Terrance,"But then all our profits come from people with problems.
"
Minister,"Don't think aboot that. Think about all the money. Here, have a bump of coke.
"
Phillip,"Okay, but we still won't stand for this!
"
Stan,"I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
"
Satan,"You have summoned the Prince of Temptation! For what purpose?!
"
Stan,"Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
"
Satan,"Then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul!  So you got dopa-mine, right? That's the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable, like eating, sex, and that's just nature, right? Like rabbits and fish and shit. They need dopa mine so that they want to consume and reproduce.
"
Stan,"Okay.
"
Satan,"But because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it, it's easy for them to overdo and have dopa-mine problems. You know, it's not fuckin' rocket science, this stuff.
"
Stan,"So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
"
Satan,"Fuck no! It's like, okay, it's like being diabetic. You know, it's like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way, you know, you've been eatin' gluten and shit, and then eventually you've got a chemical imbalance from your liver. And something clicked, and now you're diabetic forever, right? So like, if you keep doing something too much, eventually there's, ummm, a dopa-mine fuckup, right, and you're kind of screwed up for life.
"
Stan,"So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
"
Satan,"Yeah, that's pretty much what it means.
"
Stan,"The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
"
Satan,"Well who's not filling a fuckin' hole? Right? You know, I mean what kind of bullshit is that? So, let's talk about genetics now. You still have time?
"
Stan,"Yeah, no, this is great.
"
Satan,"Okay, let me get some visual aids. Gimme juuust a sec.
"
Minister,"Here is a fact: 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics. Using slot machine tactics, freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers.
"
Phillip,"Oh God, he just doesn't stop!
"
Terrance,"Who IS this guy?!
"
Minister,"We're building a new Canada with micropayments from addicts! Who cares?! You think the fucking alcohol industry cares?! They don't care that 10% are gonna get addicted, they're counting on it!! It's the same with ut! But we've got our eye on every addict's screen! Every button they click, we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats!
"
Phillip,"Why does he suddenly sound like Al Pacino in Devil's Advocate?!
"
Minister,"Hohon, I'm much worse than the Devil.  I'm the Canadian Devil. 
"
Terrance,"Oh dear God! It's the Canadian Devil!
"
Phillip,"Beelzeboot!
"
Beelzeboot,"You discovered my plan, but too late!  Now the souls of all Canadians belong to me!
"
Terrance,"Oh no!
"
Prince,"Oh, what have I done?!
"
Beelzeboot,"Heheheh! Hahaha! 
"
Satan,"So basically, the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with, um, dopa-mine regulation, and that's why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff. Okay, so we kind of understand now, champ?
"
Stan,"I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
"
Satan,"You know, they all do it, and it's kind of my deal, I have to put temptation out there too so people have free will and all that shit. But you know, everyone has their justification and thinks what they're doing is okay.
"
Voice Notification,"*Ding* Ey, buddy, where'd you go? Don't you want more Canadough?
"
Satan,"What's this?
"
Stan,"That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
"
Satan,"What, you just collect coints?
"
Announcer,"How much money can you buy today?
"
Satan,"No, see, if something's addictive because it's fun, that's one thing. But this is just blatant Skinner box manipulation. Wait a minute. Who put this out?
"
Stan,"Ah, Canada?
"
Satan,"Oh that son of a bitch! He's always doing this shit! I tell him, ""temptation has to be nuanced!"" but he goes and does this crap again! I'm gonna need to borrow your soul real quick, kid. Is that alright?
"
Stan,"...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!
"
Randy,"Oh pass interference! Interference! 
"
Sharon,"Stan, where are you going? 
"
Stan,"I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
"
Randy,"Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 
"
NC 9 Reporter,"Horror and sadness all over Canada tonight. When the Prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game, he apparently made a deal with the Canadian Devil.
"
Beelzeboot,"Hey, guy, I'm the Canadian Devil. 
"
NC 9 Reporter,"The Canadian Devil now has complete control of the soul of every Canadian. This is a sad day for Canada, and therefore, the world. 
"
Beelzeboot,"Heh heheheh, stab you. 
"
Satan,"Beelzeboot! Once again you lack any sense of nuance!
"
Phillip,"Who the fuck is that?
"
Beelzeboot,"Well well, my overachieving doppelganger! You're no match for Canadian Satan! 
"
Satan,"Return from whence you came! 
"
Beelzeboot,"Ow! Watch it, guy! 
"
NC 9 Reporter,"Sadly, a shocking turn of events here as the actual Devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the Canadian Devil! This is certainly a conundrum for Canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for. For that, let's ask the Minister of Sports in Edmonton. 
"
Minister of Sports,"Well of course, the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the Canadian Devil. But then again, he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years.
"
Canadian,"Screw that, go Canada!
"
Satan,"Enough, Beelzeboot! Thy end has come. 
"
Kyle,"Hey dude.
"
Stan,"Hey.
"
Kyle,"Y-you alright?
"
Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
"
Cartman,"Cool.
"
Prince,"My fellow Canadians, what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others. We have all learned a tragic lesson together: that though many sins are out there, when you get involved with freemium gaming, you are making a deal with the Canadian Devil. We will no longer make freemium games, and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts. Canada is back to being an ethical, respected, and shitty tundra. 
"
Stan,"I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
"
Marvin,"Well okay, good idea. 
"
Randy,"What are you gaywads doin'?
"
Stan,"We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
"
Randy,"Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 
"
Stan,"That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
"
Randy,"It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
"
Stan,"Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
"
Randy,"You guys wanna put some money on it? 
"
Butters,"WHOOAA! It's all so real! Uh this is amazing! It's like I'm there!  I see all our friends at school. Oh wow! If I hold up my hands I can see them too. Whooaa...  Wow, you were right. I can actually feel it.
"
Stan,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?
"
Butters,"I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
"
Cartman,"That's awesome, Butters.  Keep making your way down the hallway. Your vital signs are looking good. What do you see now? 
"
Butters,"More of the school. 
"
Clyde,"What are you doing, Butters?
"
Butters,"The school and all the kids.  I still can't hear any sound except for your voice.
"
Cartman,"Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
"
Butters,"Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
"
Cartman,"Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
"
Butters,"What what what?
"
Cartman,"What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
"
Butters,"Oh yeah, that it would split my neurons and scramble my brains! I forgot!
"
Cartman,"You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
"
Butters,"I'm sorry!
"
Cartman,"You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
"
Butters,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
"
Butters,"Oh Jesus! 
"
Butters,"Okay, I'm back in your room!
"
Cartman,"Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
"
Butters,"Suppornity window dropped. 
"
Cartman,"Welcome back, dude.
"
Butters,"Wow! That was cool!
"
Cartman,"How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
"
Butters,"I touched Wendy's boobs. 
"
Cartman,"And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back.""  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
"
Stan,"Sound pretty typical to me.
"
Cartman,"Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
"
Kyle,"Coup de grah, Cartman
"
Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle.
"
Stan,"Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
"
Cartman,"Dude, Butters is an asshole, and he deserves to be taken down once in a while, okay?!
"
Butters,"Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
"
Cartman,"Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
"
Butters,"You know what I said? She asked me why I wasn't in school and I said ""Well, technically I was in school."" Tee hee. Sorry guys, but Eric and I know a little something you don't. Not that it's anything that cool. Right Eric?
"
Cartman,"Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
"
Butters,"Yeah. 
"
Cartman,"See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
"
Cartman,"Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
"
Butters,"Well, not a hundred percent...
"
Cartman,"Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. 
"
Butters,"Okay, subject is ready.
"
Cartman,"Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
"
Butters,"Interim status is go.
"
Cartman,"Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 
"
Butters,"It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
"
Cartman,"All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
"
Butters,"Going now! 
"
Cartman,"Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
"
Butters,"Okay.
"
Butters,"How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
"
Cartman,"You're doing great. Almost done with this level Butters. Just make sure you clear the driveway and uh walkway of all the virtual snow.
"
Butters,"Okay. It's so realistic.  The snow looks kind of fake though.  Alright, I think that's all of it.
"
Cartman,"Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
"
Butters,"There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
"
Cartman,"Just take the money, Butters! 
"
Butters,"Okay, I got it!
"
Cartman,"You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
"
Butters,"Already? Oh no!
"
Cartman,"Yeah Butters, the discrepancy bars are oscillating. You need to uh, come back.  Are you heading back Butters?  Butters?  Alright Butters, you should be heading back to the access point now. You're going off grid.
"
Butters,"I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
"
Stephen,"There you are, mister! Just what do you think you're doing?!
"
Butters,"Hello Dad! It's me, Butters!
"
Stephen,"I know that! What do you-?
"
Butters,"This is for all the times I got grounded! 
"
Stephen,"Ohhh! Oooooo! Ohhh!
"
Butters,"HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
"
Linda,"Butters, why?? Oh my God!
"
Butters,"Huh, that was incredible!
"
Cartman,"Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
"
Butters,"I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
"
Driver,"What the hell are you doing, Kid?!
"
Cartman,"Butters, it's uhh time to stop, Get back to my place.
"
Butters,"Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
"
Driver,"Hey! 
"
Butters,"Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
"
Cartman,"Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?
"
Butters,"Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
"
Cartman,"Okay Butters, let's call it good, okay?
"
Butters,"I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
"
Cartman,"Wait, hang on Butters!
"
Butters,"Take that, you dumb hooker!
"
Hooker,"What you doin' motherfucker?!
"
Butters,"I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
"
Cartman,"Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
"
Butters,"I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
"
Cartman,"Butters?? Butters?? 
"
Dr. Carroll,"You're very lucky, young man. You've got a couple of hairline fractures, but the knife missed your spleen by half an inch.
"
Butters,"I... I d-didn't think a knife could really hurt me. Ah I thought I was just in a virtual reality.
"
Dr. Carroll,"No, you actually got stabbed by a hooker. We've called your parents and they're on their way. Your dad wanted me to let you know that you're grounded more than you can possibly imagine.
"
Butters,"Aw nuts!
"
Dr. Carroll,"Try and relax, and when your parents get here we'll sort this all out. 
"
Butters,"I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
"
Cartman,"Butters. 
"
Butters,"Ahhh!
"
Cartman,"Are you okay?
"
Butters,"Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
"
Cartman,"I'm not here, Butters.
"
Butters,"What?
"
Cartman,"This is going to be hard to understand, Butters,  but, you've become trapped in a simulation. None of this...  is real.
"
Butters,"Nuh uh!
"
Cartman,"Yeahuh huh. I told you never to take the headset off outside the access point, didn't I?! We're actually both in my house right now. You're wearing the headset and I'm talking to you as a computer program. That's why I can... manipulate reality. 
"
Butters,"WHAT?? 
"
Cartman,"You see, in this world, things aren't... what they seam. 
"
Butters,"Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!
"
Cartman,"Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
"
Butters,"Ah how do you know that?!
"
Cartman,"How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 
"
Nurse,"Everything okay in here?
"
Butters,"Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
"
Nurse,"O-kay. 
"
Cartman,"Butters.
"
Butters,"NO!
"
Cartman,"I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! 
"
Butters,"AAAAAAHAHAH! 
"
Kyle,"Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
"
Cartman,"I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
"
Steve,"Hello, Eric. My name is Steve from Oculus Customer Service. There seems to be an error with our virtual headsets, and on behalf of the company, I would like to apologize and try to help.
"
Cartman,"With what?
"
Steve,"This is going to be very jarring for you, but, there has been a malfunction with the headset you ordered from us. Right now, you're actually in your room at your computer wearing an Oculus headset, but, you're in a coma-like trance, my friend.
"
Cartman,"Fuck you!
"
Steve,"I understand your shock, my friend, but you have simply been in the virtual world so long you have forgotten.
"
Kyle,"You should probably listen to him, dude.
"
Cartman,"Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
"
Steve,"The people you are talking to are just computer programs, my friend.
"
Cartman,"Guys, tell him you're not computer programs.
"
Kyle,"Maybe we are.
"
Cartman,"Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
"
Steve,"I know this is very hard for you, but we don't have a lot of time.
"
Cartman,"Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! 
"
Liane,"Eric? Poopsiekins?  Eric?  Honey, maybe that's enough computer time. It's been about nineteen hours now.  I know you said not to disturb you with your new toy, but Mommy thought maybe you needed to eat?  All right, I'll just leave it here, hon.  I'm turning in for the night. Mommy loves you.
"
Stephen,"What kind of person did we raise you to be?! You think this world is just there for your amusement?! You are not to leave this room, and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer!
"
Butters,"Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
"
Stephen,"Oh no, mister! You are GROUNDED! 
"
Cartman,"Are you fucking with me?!
"
Butters,"...What? What do you mean?
"
Cartman,"Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
"
Butters,"I don't know what you mean.
"
Cartman,"Because if you are, it's not cool!
"
Butters,"Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
"
Cartman,"Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
"
Butters,"Oh really? Oh, that's a relief.
"
Cartman,"Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
"
Butters,"Oh gosh!
"
Cartman,"That's right!
"
Butters,"OH GOSH!
"
Cartman,"THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
"
Butters,"Yeah.
"
Cartman,"Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! 
"
Kyle,"Hello?
"
Butters,"Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!
"
Kyle,"Again?
"
Butters,"No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
"
Kyle,"Uh huh.
"
Butters,"I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
"
Kyle,"Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
"
Butters,"PLEASE! Just go to Cartman's house. I think the answer might be within the-
"
Stephen,"Butters?! Who is that?!
"
Butters,"Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- 
"
Kenny,"(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!) 
"
Kenny,"(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
"
Kyle,"You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
Kenny,"(What??)
"
Kyle,"Get up, Cartman!
"
Kenny,"(This isn't a prank, Kyle!)
"
Kyle,"Okay, then let's take him to the hospital. You hear that, fatso!  You're goin' to the hospital!
"
Stan,"Kyle, maybe this is for real.
"
Kyle,"Fuck you if you're in on this.
"
Stan,"In on what?  Ohh,  Fuck you!
"
Steve,"Yes, no, sorry, but because you bought two business-class tickets I can NOT refund the fares.  That's right, there is nothing we can do. All right. Have I answered all your customer concerns in a timely, polite manner? Thank you for calling Korean Airlines Customer Service.  El Pollo Loco Customer Service, this is Steve.
"
Kyle,"Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
"
Steve,"Oh, yes, ah, yes my friend.  Oculus Customer Service, this is Steve.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, our friend has been missing for a few days, so we went and checked on him, and he's in a coma wearing your headset.
"
Steve,"Ohh yehhs, yes. What is your name please?
"
Kyle,"Kyle.
"
Steve,"Kyle. I need to advise you that this call may be recorded to help with better customer service in the future. Is that agreeable to you?
"
Kyle,"I don't care!
"
Steve,"He doesn't care! I can continue! All right, listen very carefully my friend. The headsets we sold you are having some minor problems.
"
Kyle,"You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
"
Steve,"Yes. And that is why we are trying to locate all the headsets and do a recall. Do you understand? It is a Total Recall.
"
Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
Stan,"""Fuck you"" what?
"
Kyle,"He said they're doing a Total Recall.
"
Stan,"Oh fuck you!
"
Steve,"All right, did I take care of all your customer needs in a timely and satisfactory fashion today?
"
Kyle,"You haven't done anything yet!
"
Steve,"But the customer service - was that reliable? And did I accurately and politely respond to your concerns?
"
Kyle,"We need help! Our friend is in a coma!
"
Steve,"Uhhh let's see, ah, it looks like... one of you is going to have to put on the Oculus headset and go into the virtual world and convince your friend to get to an access point. Could you try that, my friend? 
"
Cartman,"It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. 
"
Kyle,"Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
"
Cartman,"I know. Let's go to the backyard. 
"
Kyle,"Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
"
Cartman,"Okay Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
"
Cartman,"Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
"
Cartman,"Mmmhmm.
"
Kyle,"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
"
Cartman,"And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
"
Kyle,"Www-what do you mean?
"
Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to brace yourself. This is going to be extremely hard to believe, but you are the one that has been in a coma with a VR headset on.
"
Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
Cartman,"I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
"
Kyle,"Don't... do that!
"
Cartman,"Calm down.
"
Kyle,"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
"
Cartman,"In virtual reality, yes you did.
"
Kyle,"No. Then I came into this virtual space.
"
Cartman,"You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
Kyle,"Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
Cartman,"Fuck!
"
Best Buy Rep,"Thanks for callin' Best Buy. How can I direct your call?
"
Kyle,"Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
"
Cartman,"Or if I did?
"
Kyle,"Or if you sold one to an ""Eric Cartman""?
"
Best Buy Rep,"Sir, I'm gonna have to connect you to Customer Service. Hang on a sec. 
"
Steve,"Best Buy Customer Service, this is Steve.
"
Kyle,"Dude... What?
"
Cartman,"What?  Hello?
"
Steve,"Yes, hello. This call may be recorded to ensure good customer service in the future.
"
Cartman,"Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
"
Stephen,"Well, this looks like a lovely meal. Too bad Butters won't be enjoying it. You hear that, mister?! No dinner for you! While you're grounded you can just GO TO BED HUNGRY! Linda, do you remember why Butters is grounded? What what did he do?
"
Linda,"Oh. I don't know, Stephen, I let you handle all the groundings.
"
Stephen,"It's strange. I don't recall him really doing anything particularly bad, and yet... and yet he is grounded.  And no bouncing the racquetball either!
"
Stan,"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
"
Kyle,"Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
"
Stan,"It's neither. I know this might be hard for you to grasp right now, but this is all actually real.
"
Kyle,"Nono, after we found Cartman, I put the headset on and then-
"
Stan,"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
"
Kyle,"Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
"
Cartman,"No, you guys. This is virtual reality.
"
Stan,"How do you know?
"
Cartman,"Because... I'm a computer program.
"
Kyle,"God damn it Cartman!
"
Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, I swear, you have to believe me, I am a computer program. I'm not real.
"
Kyle,"He's lying.
"
Cartman,"I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
"
Stan,"What was the name of the first person who called you for customer service?
"
Steve,"Ohhh yes yes yes! That I can answer! His name was... But-ters!
"
Stan,"Butters called Customer Service first?
"
Steve,"Have I answered all your questions in a satisfying and courteous manner?
"
Stan,"Come on, we're going to Butters' house! 
"
Steve,"Hello? My friend? My friend, I believe we are having some technical issues with our phone line. Please hang on, I'm going to call Customer Service.
"
Steve,"Hello, Customer Service, this is Steve.
"
Steve,"Hello, this is Steve with Customer Service.
"
Steve,"Uhhh, nononono my friend. I am Steve with Customer Service.
"
Steve,"Listen, my friend. This is gong to be very hard to comprehend, but none of what you are seeing is real.
"
Steve,"...Ohhh, nohhh, nonononononono.
"
Steve,"My friend, my friend, a customer who is in virtual reality called Customer Service, and it has created a customer feedback loop. Okay? Here in India we call it a customer feedback vindaloop.
"
Steve,"Ohhh, fuck you!
"
Steve,"Nononononono, do not fuck me, because I am you and then we will just be fucking ourselves. Now, have I provided answers to your questions in a courteous and prompt fashion?
"
Steve,"What do you mean have you answered all my questions?! NO! You have not answered ANY questions at ALL!
"
Steve,"Nonononono no, listen, listen: if I didn't answer your questions, then we have given bad customer service!
"
Steve,"But you didn't answer any of my questions!
"
Steve,"Well what is more important, my friend? The result, or good customer service?
"
Butters,"I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
"
Stan,"Butters.
"
Butters,"Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.
"
Kyle,"Why not?
"
Butters,"Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
"
Kyle,"Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
"
Butters,"When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
"
Stan,"So now we are in th real world.
"
Butters,"YES.
"
Cartman,"You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
"
Stephen,"Butters!
"
Butters,"AAaaghagh!
"
Stephen,"What are your friends doing here?!
"
Butters,"Huh I'm sorry Dad!
"
Steve,"Hello, hello my friend, are you still there?
"
Stan,"Yes, we're here.
"
Steve,"Listen carefully, my friend. You are stuck in a paradox. It turns out there are three things you cannot do in virtual reality. You cannot die, you cannot get grounded, and you cannot call Customer Service. This is why you are having problems.
"
Stephen,"You just don't get it, do you?! What is wrong with you?!
"
Stan,"Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
"
Steve,"That does not matter! There is only one thing that matters!
"
Stan,"What?! 
"
Steve,"Have I answered your questions satisfactorily and offered GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE?!
"
Stan,"That doesn't make sense! 
"
Steve,"That's the paradox! Please my friend, please! I am not real! You are not real! Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?! This call may be recorded! 
"
Stephen,"Well you're getting it now!
"
Stan,"Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
"
Kyle,"We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
"
Stan,"Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
"
Stephen,"Oh my gosh! Linda!
"
Linda,"What is it, Stephen?
"
Stephen,"It's Butters. He's not grounded anymore.
"
Linda,"He's not?
"
Stephen,"No. I've I've got to tell him!  Butter? Butters! 
"
Butters,"Ahhh, huh?
"
Stephen,"You can go outside and play, son.
"
Butters,"You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
"
Stephen,"No. I don't know why or how, but... it's over.
"
Butters,"They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
"
Stan,"Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
"
Kyle,"We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
"
Stan,"Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
"
Cartman,"Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. 
"
Kyle,"Alright, dude, take off the headset. 
"
Kyle,"Sssoo aside from all the bull crap, what do ya think of the Oculus?
"
Stan,"It's pretty cool, but the graphics suck.
"
Butters,"Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore."
Girl 1,"Hey guys.  Thanks. Support your team? Thank you. Hey guys. Did you get one of these?  Hope you can make it.
"
Cartman,"What's this?
"
Girl 1,"The girls volleyball team has a big game tonight and we're just asking for people to come cheer us on.
"
Cartman,"Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
"
Girl 2,"What's wrong with supporting girls athletics?!
"
Cartman,"Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.
"
Girl 3,"You know, we're actually in the playoffs, and all we keep hearing is ""We're too busy.""
"
Kyle,"But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
"
Girl 3,"What fight?
"
Stan,"Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
"
Cartman,"Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
"
Player,"Alright, I'm going to play a fifth mana card... and then I'm going to attack with my elderbeast- hold on. Wait. Hold on.
"
Kyle,"Can Kenny block his elderbeast?
"
Stan,"Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
"
Cartman,"This asshole needs to make a move already!
"
Referee,"Quiet in the peanut gallery, please.
"
Player,"I am attacking, but with a newly summoned spark ghast who has trample. Four damage to your planeswalker.
"
Boys,"Ohhhh!
"
Butters,"Oh no! Kenny!
"
Stan,"Shhh!
"
Butters,"But he's dying! 
"
Stan,"What's that?
"
Cartman,"He's playing an enchantment.
"
Stan,"This late?
"
Kyle,"He just stacked his Shapeshifter with an Elven Blade!
"
Player,"I can block that with uprooted Minotaur. 
"
Boys,"Ohhhh!
"
Referee,"Serendib Sorcerer unblocked. Winner: McCormick!
"
Boys,"Yeeahhh!
"
Player,"Nnoohhh!
"
Cartman,"Dude, it was complete brutality!
"
Kyle,"You've never seen anything so ruthless!
"
Stan,"It was seriously almost hard to watch. 
"
Cartman,"At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
"
Stan,"Wendy, did you hear about last night?
"
Wendy,"Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points.
"
Stan,"Not that. Did you actually go to that?
"
Wendy,"Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
"
Stan,"Pfft whatever.
"
Cartman,"Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
"
Janitor,"Hey! Pssst!  Come over here.  You guys like hard-core stuff, huh?
"
Cartman,"Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
"
Janitor,"Yeah well, you boys wanna get in on some real action? If you like excitement. I'm not talkin' about the little boys stuff. I'm talkin' about real man shit.
"
Stan,"We're men.
"
Janitor,"Well then, if you wanna see REAL fights with REAL brutality, go here.  This is the underground stuff, so keep it quiet.  And you might wanna pack a barf bag.
"
Cartman,"Kewwwl!
"
Kyle,"Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
"
Cartman,"What's hardcore and exciting about City shrimp? 
"
Kyle,"It doesn't even look like they're open. 
"
Mr. Tuong,"We crosed! We crosed for the night! Go away prease! 
"
Stan,"Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?
"
Mr. Tuong,"You purice?
"
Kenny,"(What?)
"
Cartman,"Dude, do we look like police?
"
Mr. Tuong,"Okay, come on, come on, five darra, five darra each! Come on, five darra!
"
Cartman,"Five darrar? 
"
Mr. Tuong,"You go down! Go down, find seat! We in sixth fight! Gogogogogogogo! 
"
Announcer,"Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card. Fluffy counters with a mana card of his own. And he plays a fugitive wizard!
"
Crowd,"Ooooooo.
"
Announcer,"More mana from Scrambles! And yes, that is Crippling Blight! Crippling Blight to the fugitive wizard! Creature now has -1 to strength and defense! More Mana from Fluffy. Now he'll attack with fugitive wizard, and there's an instant attack from Scrambles! That is peel from reality! Fugitive wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!
"
The boys,"Whoa!
"
Announcer,"The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It's Mass Calcify against Into the Void!
"
Cartman,"Dude, that was total carnage!
"
Stan,"That was freakin' hardcore.
"
Cartman,"Can you believe that rooster played a Kalonian Twingrove with half his mana tapped?
"
Stan,"It was just decimation.
"
Kyle,"It was really about the most man thing I think we've ever been a part of.
"
Cartman,"We're going again on Friday, right?
"
Stan,"Hell yeah! 
"
Cartman,"What's the matter Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
"
Stan,"What's mean about it?
"
Cartman,"You feel bad for the roosters?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, I feel bad for the roosters.)
"
Stan,"Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
"
Cartman,"Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
"
Kenny,"(No.)
"
Cartman,"Huh? A little bit?
"
Kenny,"(NO.)
"
Stan,"Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
"
Kyle,"Dude, totally. With Kenny's Magic skills, we could probably kick serious ass!
"
Cartman,"What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. 
"
Det. Harris,"Hello, Mr. McCormick. Surprised to see us?
"
Stuart,"What do you mean?
"
Det. Harris,"Let's cut the crap, huh? We know there's an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who's leading it.
"
Stuart,"What's cock Magic?
"
Det. Harris,"Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play ""Magic: the Gathering,"" and you know nothing about it because you're 'white'. Let's git something straight: cock Magic isn't an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they're poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?
"
Stuart,"I don't go to any cock Magic fights!
"
Det. Harris,"Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It's illegal, and it's wrong. And anyone I find involved with this filth is going down!
"
Randy,"Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
"
Stan,"Dad, it's not that big a deal.
"
Randy,"It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
"
Kyle,"You were?
"
Randy,"Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 
"
Stan,"Dad, that's not, that's not cock Magic.
"
Randy,"Oh? Not impressed? How about this? 
"
Voice,"What is it?!
"
Cartman,"Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
Voice,"Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.
"
Kyle,"Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
"
Breeder,"Come on to the back, don't mind the smell.  We only deal in the highest quality poultry planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?
"
Kyle,"We don't... really know the difference.
"
Breeder,"Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks.
"
Stan,"Do you think they're happy?
"
Breeder,"Do I think they're happy?
"
Stan,"Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
Breeder,"They're fuckin' chickens.
"
Cartman,"Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
"
Breeder,"Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.
"
Cartman,"Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?
"
Stan,"Hey, how about this little guy?
"
Breeder,"That one's kind of young. I don't even know what kinda cards he prefers.
"
Kyle,"Then he's perfect for us.
"
Cartman,"What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about ""McNuggets""?
"
Kyle,"Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
"
Cartman,"""Yes I do, you guys.""  Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?
"
Shelley,"Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He's been in there for an hour!
"
Sharon,"Randy?
"
Randy,"Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
"
Sharon,"Randy, what are you doing?!
"
Randy,"Oh! Nothing, Sharon. Just going to the bathroom, if you don't mind.  Hey!
"
Sharon,"Randy, why are there drums playing? 
"
Randy,"All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
"
Sharon,"Ohhh, no no nononononono no.
"
Randy,"Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
"
Sharon,"I know that's why you got kicked out of college.
"
Randy,"Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
"
Sharon,"Stanley??
"
Randy,"People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 
"
Announcer,"Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying! And now he casts Geistflame, dealing one damage to McNuggets.
"
Cartmen,"Come on, McNuggets! Fight!
"
Kyle,"You can do it, McNuggets! 
"
Announcer,"Quite please.
"
Someone,"I think I'll bet on the next one.
"
Announcer,"Waaiitt!  McNuggets has cast Punishing Fire, absorbing the Geistflame and dealing two damage to the opponent! Game, set and match, McNuggets!
"
Crowd,"Whoa!
"
Stan,"Yeah!
"
Cartman,"All right McNuggets!
"
Kyle,"All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
"
Cartman,"That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls volleyball.
"
Promoter,"Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.
"
Cartman,"Thank you so very much.
"
Promoter,"I've never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?
"
Kyle,"You mean there's more to this?
"
Promoter,"Oh yes. And I'm not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I'm talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here's the address.  Let's see what kind of money your cock can really make.
"
Stan,"Gee, thanks!
"
Cartman,"You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
"
Woman,"Okay kids, it's time for our birthday show. Everyone, let's be quiet now. Come on.
"
Kindergarten boy,"Yay, a show, a show!
"
Woman,"Do you kids like magic?
"
Kindergartners,"Yeah, yay!
"
Woman,"Okay, well let's all give a cheer for the Amazingly Randi! 
"
Randy,"Hey kids, are we having fun?  Oh where'd my hat go?! Anyone see my hat? 
"
Woman,"Okay, the magician has started. Let's get the cake ready.
"
Randy,"Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
"
Man,"They're getting a kick out the magician, huh?
"
Randy,"Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 
"
Kindergarten boy,"I hate you!
"
Stan,"Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
"
Kyle,"It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
"
Craig,"Where was all this?
"
Cartman,"We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
"
Kyle,"Yeah, you gotta know people.
"
Butters,"Dangit, I wish I knew people.
"
Mr. Garrison,"All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. 
"
Coach,"Thank you, Mr. Garrison. Listen uh, last night we had a pretty big game against Evergreen. The girls really hammered 'em, but once again we're a... little disappointed in the turnout.
"
Cartman,"Oh Jesus, give it a rest already.
"
Butters,"Yeah.
"
Coach,"You know, when you put your all into something, it's kind of a bummer when people don't seem to care.  Kind of makes you feel like the sport you love is becoming a joke.
"
Stan,"Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
"
Cartman,"OOHHH!! 
"
Jimmy,"Fantastic girls volleyball joke, Stan.
"
Coach,"The girls wanted to say something, so we're now going to hear a few words from the captain of the girls volleyball team.
"
Wendy,"Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. 
"
Cartman,"Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
"
Man,"And then he uh, took his penis from behind our daughter's ear and uh, we uh, uh that's when we saw him with uh, the n-the three rings. and uh, his penis, he was pulling it through 'em somehow, uh.
"
Det. Harris,"Uh huh. And what about the cock Magic? Where was that? 
"
Man,"Well that's what I'm telling you. It was right here exce-except for the thing where he poured the milk into his penis; he did that over there.
"
Det. Harris,"Alright alright, let's focus. What kind of decks were they using?
"
Woman,"Decks??
"
Man,"Who? There weren't any ""decks.""
"
Det. Harris,"Oh, I get it now. Do you know what the penalty is for calling in a false cock Magic report?
"
Woman,"I'm so confused, babe.
"
Det. Harris,"Who paid you to call us and take our focus away from the investigation?! What color were they?!
"
Man,"Nobody paid us anything! Now, there has been a crime here and you'd better do something about it!
"
Det. Harris,"Agreed! Who first called 911? 
"
Woman,"Please! Don't take me away from my child!
"
Girl,"Mommy!
"
Kyle,"This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
"
Cartman,"Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. 
"
Manager,"Sorry, Panda Express is crosed. We crosed!
"
Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
"
Manager,"Oh okay, come on, ten darra, ten darra.
"
Cartman,"Ten darra?! 
"
Announcer 2,"For the next round, it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds, versus Clucky
"
Cartman,"Who is that??
"
Spectator 1,"That's Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds.  He's never lost a fight. Hell, he's never even lost one health!
"
Stan,"What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
"
Cartman,"Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
"
Kyle,"McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
"
Cartman,"McNuggets is scared, dude!
"
Stan,"Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
"
Spectator 2,"He didn't stand a chance. Not one spell cast before he was obliterated by health drains! That thing isn't human! 
"
Promoter,"Alright, your rooster's up next, boys.
"
Kyle,"Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
"
Promoter,"He doesn't have a choice
"
Cartman,"This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
"
Promoter,"What do you think all these people are here to see?
"
Cartman,"Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
"
Promoter,"The hell you do! Get your cock in there! 
"
ESPN Announcer,"You're watching ESPN Illegal. Your source for bullfighting, dogfighting, and cock Magic.
"
ESPN Host,"And a warm welcome back to the Cock Magic Championships. Certainly an electric atmosphere here in the basement of Panda Express. The fight we were expecting, of course, Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds versus ten-month-old Cornish rooster McNuggets. In a complete shocker, the challenger McNuggets has been scratched and substituting for him is nine-year-old Kenny McCormick. Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock Magic. Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move.  Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds plays a creature card. 
"
Cartman,"Jesus, Paragon of Fierce Defiance. Now every red creature Gadnuk plays will have a +1 attack.
"
Crowd,"Whooaa.
"
Kyle,"Come on, Kenny! 
"
Stan,"What did he play? Did he tap all his mana?
"
Cartman,"Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
"
Kyle,"He just had to shuffle it.
"
Cartman,"Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.
"
Stan,"Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
"
ESPN Host,"A second Elvish Mystic now, and Gadnuk attacks with Merciful Pretender. McCormick sends Charging Rhino to the graveyard. He's desperate now. Not too much he can-OH! And he's just laid down Life's Legacy!
"
Crowd,"Ooooohh...
"
ESPN Host,"That was not expected! Gadnuk doesn't know what hit him! McCormick follows with Crackling Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!
"
Kyle,"Holy shit, dude!
"
ESPN Host,"Gadnuk tries to block with Living Totem but OH, there is Terra Stomper! This is absolute savagery! Frenzied Goblin has been sent to the graveyard and now there is no one to block Pearl Lake Ancient! My God, someone has to put a stop to this!
"
Det. Harris,"Freeze!  Well, well! Looks like I finally caught the big boys! You're all going to jail for a long time!  Especially you, scumbag!
"
Promoter,"Lousy cops! How did you find us?
"
Det. Harris,"We saw your fliers.  ""Panda Express. Cock Magic at 9 pm.""
"
Promoter,"We didn't put those fliers out!
"
Announcer,"And now, for your halftime entertainment, please welcome... the incomparable, the beautiful, the Amazingly Randi! 
"
Cartman,"Ah, dude, your dad's here.
"
Randy,"Thank you, hey! You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there's no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing.  Whatever you believe is real, is real. 
"
Head,"Come on Barbie, let's go party. 
"
Spectator 3,"Ewww! 
"
Randy,"Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
"
Det. Harris,"I'll volunteer.
"
Randy,"Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?
"
Det. Harris,"I'm Detective Harris, South Park Police.
"
Randy,"All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 
"
Cartman,"It was so hardcore you guys. Kenny laid waste to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds. It got so out of hands that the fucking cops had to come and break it up.
"
Butters,"Wow, the cops came?
"
Kyle,"Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
"
Cartman,"Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
"
Kenny,"(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
"
Kyle,"Hey yeah, what about poor McNuggets? What's he gonna do now?
"
Stan,"Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
"
Kyle,"Got what?
"
Stan,"A way to finally do something good for other people.
"
Announcer,"South Park serves, and McNuggets plays a Plains Land card. One-nill, South Park.  Another serve, and McNuggets summons Downtreader Elk. One south Park player is eliminated. You, the girl with the ponytails - you are dead.
"
Kyle,"It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
"
Cartman,"Ahem, how's it going brahs? This is CartmaaanBrah!
"
Kyle,"Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
"
Girl,"Grandpa!
"
Kyle,"I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
"
Kyle,"But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
"
Kyle,"Whattaya think?
"
Butters,"Hmmm, it's kind of gay.
"
Kyle,"Really??
"
Butters,"I mean, havin' it all rhyme 'n stuff, you know?
"
Kyle,"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome.""
"
Butters,"Well, gay is wholesome.
"
Kyle,"But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
"
Sheila,"Kyle, Bill Cosby is here to see you.
"
Kyle,"Bill Cosby.
"

"
Kyle,"We?
"
Bill Cosby,"I'm just a small part of a big epic holiday special, which is gonna air this weekend.  It's a shame how families don't gather in their living rooms like they used to, and we think a big holiday special is just the thing America needs now.
"
Kyle,"Wow.  Well that's awesome!
"
Bill Cosby,"Well the producers of the show saw how much your idea was trending and thought we should get your hash-tag on board with ours.
"
Kyle,"M-Ah, I'd love to.
"
Bill Cosby,"Great! I'll go right now and tell them you're on board. We've gotta do this quickly!
"
Kyle,"Uh okay! No problem! 
"
Bill Cosby,"This holiday special is gonna bring families together again, son!
"
Kyle,"Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!
"
Bill Cosby,"Happy Holidays! 
"
Det. Harris,"Mr. Marsh, forgive me if I say your story sounds a little farfetched. You're saying that these people who what you killed are entertainment producers?
"
Randy,"Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
"
Officer 1,"Who's the famous artist?
"
Randy,"Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
"
Det. Harris,"You're Lorde.
"
Sharon,"The nineteen year old pop star. It's true, that's him.
"
Officer 1,"You mean the girl who just showed her asshole on Jimmy Fallon?
"
Randy,"No! That was a copy of me!
"
Officer 2,"Right. The thing that I jacked off to was you! Huh! 
"
Randy,"Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
"
Officer 3,"Detective Harris! Sir! We've got a problem!
"
Det. Harris,"What is it, Adams?
"
Adams,"We've arrested a black man who was snooping around the old Jefferson estate!
"
Det. Harris,"Did you choke him?
"
Adams,"Yes!
"
Det. Harris,"Did you shoot him?
"
Adams,"YES!
"
Det. Harris,"So what's the problem?
"
Adams,"He... appears to be just a hologram, sir.
"
MJ's Hologram,"Naw, it's ignorant! You don't understand! We have to stop them! Heee hee!
"
Det. Harris,"Oh my God. Are you sure that hologram is black??
"
Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?!
"
Stan,"Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
"
Kyle,"They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
"
Stan,"Who did?
"
Kyle,"These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
"
Stan,"That's a little strange, isn't it?
"
Kyle,"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!

"
Exec. 1,"So far the holiday special is trending fine, but it appears that the Michael Jackson hologram is the most heavily tweeted.
"
Record Producer,"And we still have no idea where the damned hologram is?
"
Ron,"Not yet, but Tupac is close to hunting him down.
"
Cartman,"Look at that guy. He's like 40, but he's got a Justin Bieber haircut.
"
Record Producer,"We got one shot at this, people! This  has to be the holiday special to end all holiday specials!
"
Ron,"Sir, I get that you brought this YouTube commentator in because he's popular with the younger kids, but now he's trying to tell us what the show should be called??
"
Record Producer,"He's got his finger on the pulse of young America.
"
Exec. 2,"Sir, I'm pretty sure that  ""Washington Redskins Go Fuck Yourself Holiday Special"" is not a good name.
